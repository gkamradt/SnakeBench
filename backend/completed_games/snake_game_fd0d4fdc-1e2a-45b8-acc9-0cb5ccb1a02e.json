            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see where I am now. My snake is at (1,3) with the body at [(1,2)] because I just moved up to eat the apple there. The apples now are at (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). Wait, the initial list had (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). But after eating the one at (1,3), that apple is gone. So the remaining apples are those five minus (1,3)? Wait, no, the initial apples were (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). The apple at (1,3) was part of the board state, but maybe the list in the problem was different. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe user message says \"Apples at: (9, 2), (9, 7), (9, 0), (8, 7), (0, 8)\". But in the board state, there's an A at (1,3) (since the snake was at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)]). Wait, maybe the initial setup had the snake at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)] because it just moved up. So the apple at (1,3) was eaten in the last move. So the remaining apples are the ones listed: (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). So those are the current apples.\n\nSo now, my snake is at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]. The next move is to decide where to go. The available directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nUP from (1,3) would take me to (1,4). Is that safe? The board shows that (1,4) is empty. No snake or apple there. Moving there would not hit anything. But there's no apple, so I won't grow. But moving up would keep me safe and explore towards the top.\n\nDOWN would take me to (1,2), which is my own body. That's a collision, so I can't go DOWN.\n\nLEFT to (0,3). Is that safe? The board shows (0,3) is empty. No snakes there. So moving left is possible. But again, no apple there. The apple at (0,8) is far up. So moving left would be safe but not towards an apple.\n\nRIGHT to (2,3). That's also empty. No immediate threat. But again, no apple there. The closest apples are at (9,2), (8,7), etc. So moving right might be a way to head towards those, but it's a long path.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (9,2) is on the top right, (9,7) and (8,7) are also top right, (9,0) is bottom right, and (0,8) is top left. The apple at (0,8) is at the top left corner. From my current position (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then left to (0,4), then up to (0,5), etc., could eventually reach (0,8). But that's several moves. Alternatively, moving right towards the center might get me closer to other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (0,8) is the closest in terms of vertical distance. From (1,3) to (0,8) is 5 units up and 1 left. But moving up and left would take time. Alternatively, moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), etc., towards (0,8). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe the apples on the right are more reachable.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,2) is at the bottom right. From (1,3), moving right across the board to x=9, y=2. That's 8 steps right and 1 down. But that's a long way. The enemy snake is at (6,6), which is in the middle. So moving towards (9,2) might risk crossing paths with the enemy.\n\nThe apple at (8,7) is at the top right. From (1,3), moving right and up. That's 7 steps right and 4 up. Also a long path. The apple at (9,7) is even further.\n\nThe apple at (0,8) is top left. From (1,3), moving left to (0,3) then up to (0,8). That's 5 up. So 5 moves up. But that's a possible path. However, moving up from (1,3) to (1,4), then (1,5), etc., but that's along the same column. But maybe there's a risk of getting trapped if I go too far up without a plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should head towards the apple at (0,8). Let's see: from (1,3), moving left to (0,3), then up to (0,4), (0,5), etc., until (0,8). That's 5 moves up. But each move up would require checking for safety. Alternatively, moving up first, then left.\n\nBut the immediate next move: if I go UP to (1,4), that's safe. Then next move, I can go UP again to (1,5), and so on. But there's no apple in that path until (0,8). Alternatively, moving RIGHT towards the center might open up more options.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (6,6) with no body. They might be moving towards apples as well. If they head towards (8,7) or (9,7), that's their path. But I'm on the left side, so maybe focusing on (0,8) is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (0,8) is the only one on the left side. So moving towards that makes sense. Let's plan a path.\n\nFrom (1,3):\n\nOption 1: Move LEFT to (0,3), then UP to (0,4), (0,5), etc., until (0,8). That's 5 moves up. But each step, I need to avoid colliding with myself. Since my body is now [(1,3), (1,2)] after moving. Wait, after moving UP to (1,4), the body becomes [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]? Wait, no. Wait, the snake's body is [(1,3), (1,2)] because the head is at (1,3) and the body is [(1,2)]. So when I move, the head moves to the new position, and the body follows. So if I move UP to (1,4), the new body becomes [(1,3), (1,2)]. Then next move, if I move UP again to (1,5), the body becomes [(1,4), (1,3)]. So the tail moves forward each step unless I eat an apple.\n\nBut since there's no apple in the immediate path, moving towards (0,8) would require several steps without growing. But the apple at (0,8) is there. So maybe it's worth the journey.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT towards the center to get closer to other apples. For example, moving RIGHT to (2,3), then (3,3), etc., towards (9,2) or (8,7). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, check if there's any other apple closer. The apples are at (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). The closest in terms of Manhattan distance from (1,3):\n\n- (0,8): |1-0| + |3-8| = 1 +5=6\n- (9,2): 8 +1=9\n- (9,7): 8 +4=12\n- (8,7):7 +4=11\n- (9,0):8 +3=11\n\nSo (0,8) is the closest. So moving towards (0,8) makes sense.\n\nSo the plan is to move LEFT to (0,3), then UP towards (0,8). But first, moving LEFT to (0,3) is safe. Let's check the board state again. The board shows that at column 0, row 8 is an apple (0,8). So moving left to (0,3) is safe. Then from there, moving up each step.\n\nBut wait, moving LEFT from (1,3) to (0,3) is possible. Then next move, UP to (0,4), etc. But each move without an apple won't grow the snake, so the body length remains the same. So the snake's body would be [(0,3), (1,3), (1,2)] after moving left. Wait, no. The snake's body is the previous positions. When the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. So if the snake is at (1,3) with body [(1,2)], moving LEFT to (0,3) would make the new body [(1,3)]. So the tail moves forward. So the body length is maintained unless an apple is eaten.\n\nSince there's no apple at (0,3), moving there would not increase the length. So the body becomes [(1,3)], and the head is at (0,3). Then next move, if I go UP to (0,4), the body becomes [(0,3)], and so on. So the snake's length is 2 (head + 1 body segment) because I ate one apple before. Wait, initial state: the snake was at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)], which is length 2. After moving UP to (1,4), the body becomes [(1,3)], so length remains 2. If I eat an apple, the body grows by one. So since I just ate the apple at (1,3), the snake's length is now 2 (head at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]). Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow. So after moving to (1,3) (the apple), the snake's body becomes [(1,3), (1,2)], making the length 3. Wait, the initial body was [(1,2)] when the head was at (1,3). So after eating the apple, the body grows by one. So the next move, when you move, the tail doesn't move. So the body becomes [(1,3), (1,2)] when you move to a new position. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the growth mechanics.\n\nWhen the snake moves into an apple, it grows by one segment. So the next move, when you move, the tail doesn't advance. So after eating an apple, the snake's length increases by one. So in the previous move, the snake was at (1,2) with body [(1,2)] (head) and [(1,1)]? Wait, no. The initial state after the last move: the snake was at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)]. That implies that the snake had just moved UP from (1,2) to (1,3), eating the apple there, so the body becomes [(1,2)] (the previous head position). So the snake's length is 2 (head + 1 body segment). Then, when moving again, if you don't eat an apple, the body moves forward, so the tail moves. So after moving to a new position without eating, the body becomes the previous head position, and the tail is cut.\n\nBut in this current state, after eating the apple at (1,3), the snake's length is now 2 (head at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]). Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one. So if the snake was length 1 (head only), after eating, it becomes length 2 (head and one body segment). If it was length 2, after eating, it becomes length 3. So in the previous move, the snake was at (1,2) with body [(1,1)] (length 2). Then moved UP to (1,3), ate the apple, so the body becomes [(1,2), (1,1)] (length 3). But according to the user's current state, the snake is at (1,3) with body [(1,2)]. That suggests that the snake's length is 2. So maybe the initial state after the last move was that the snake was at (1,3) with body [(1,2)], implying that it just ate an apple, so the body grew by one. So the length is now 2 (head + 1 body). So when moving next, if you don't eat an apple, the body moves, so the tail (the last segment) is removed. Wait, no. The snake's movement works such that each time it moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. If it eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. If it doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves forward, so the body length remains the same.\n\nSo in the current state, after eating the apple, the snake's body is [(1,2)] (so total length 2). When moving next, if it doesn't eat an apple, the body will become the previous head position, and the tail (1,2) is removed. So the new body would be [(1,3)], and the head moves to the new position. So the length remains 2.\n\nBut this is getting a bit confusing. Let's focus on the current position and possible moves.\n\nCurrent position: head at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]. So the snake's length is 2. The next move can be UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nUP: (1,4). Check if that's safe. The board shows that (1,4) is empty. No snakes or apples there. So moving UP is safe. No apple, so the snake's body becomes [(1,3)], and the head moves to (1,4). Length remains 2.\n\nDOWN: (1,2). That's the body segment. Collision, so can't move DOWN.\n\nLEFT: (0,3). Check if that's safe. The board shows (0,3) is empty. So moving LEFT is safe. No apple there, so body becomes [(1,3)], head at (0,3). Length remains 2.\n\nRIGHT: (2,3). Safe, no apple. Body becomes [(1,3)], head at (2,3). Length remains 2.\n\nSo all possible moves except DOWN are safe. Now, which direction leads towards the nearest apple?\n\nThe nearest apple is (0,8) at Manhattan distance 6. To reach (0,8), moving LEFT to (0,3) then UP through (0,4) to (0,8) would take 5 moves up. Each move up without apples would keep the snake at length 2. But when reaching (0,8), eating the apple would increase the length to 3.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (1,3) to (1,4), then (1,5), etc., towards (0,8) would take longer. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT towards the center to get closer to other apples. For example, moving RIGHT to (2,3), then (3,3), etc., towards (9,2) or (8,7). But those are much further.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (6,6) with no body. They might be moving towards the apples on the right side. So maybe the apples on the right are more contested. The apple at (0,8) is on the left, so maybe it's safer to go for that.\n\nSo the best move is to go LEFT to (0,3) to start heading towards (0,8). That way, I can move up along the left edge to reach the apple. Moving LEFT now is safe and starts the journey towards the closest apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (1,4) keeps me in the same column, but there's no apple there. But maybe there's a path to another apple. However, the closest apple is (0,8), so moving LEFT seems better.\n\nAnother thing to consider: after moving LEFT to (0,3), the next move would be UP to (0,4), then (0,5), etc. Each of those positions is safe as long as there's no obstacle. Since the enemy is at (6,6), they are far away. So the path seems safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (0,3) to start moving towards the apple at (0,8).\n</think>\n\nLEFT  \nRationale: The closest remaining apple is at (0,8). Moving LEFT to (0,3) starts the path upward along the left edge, avoiding self-collision and safely navigating toward the apple.  \nStrategy: Next moves should continue UP along the left column to reach (0,8) while monitoring for new apple spawns or enemy movements.  \nDirection: LEFT"

The apples are at (1,3), (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7). The enemy snake is at (6,5) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I should check the positions of the apples relative to my current position. The closest apple is at (1,3), which is directly above me. If I move UP from (1,2) to (1,3), I can eat that apple and grow. That seems like a good immediate target. But I need to make sure that moving there is safe. Since my body is empty, moving into that spot won't hit myself. Also, the enemy snake is at (6,5), which is far away, so no collision risk there. So moving UP to get the apple at (1,3) seems safe and beneficial.\n\nOther apples are further away. The ones at (9,2) and (9,0) are on the right edge. Moving right towards them would take several moves, and I might have to compete with the enemy snake. But since the enemy is at (6,5), maybe they're heading towards other apples. But for the first move, getting the closest apple makes sense.\n\nWait, what about possible future moves? If I go UP to (1,3), then next turn I can look for the next apple. Let's see, after eating (1,3), my body would have a segment. Then I need to plan the next move. But for now, the immediate move is to get the apple. Also, moving UP is safe because there's no obstacle in that direction. The board shows that (1,3) is an apple, so moving there is good.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (2,2) would take me towards the center, but there's no apple there. Moving LEFT would take me to (0,2), which is safe but no apple. Moving DOWN to (1,1) is also safe but no apple. So the best option is UP to get the apple and start growing.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's position. Snake #1 is at (6,5). They might be heading towards the apples at (9,7) or (8,7), but that's on the top right. Since I'm on the left side, maybe I can focus on the apples on the left first. The apple at (1,3) is the closest, so that's the priority.\n\nSo the plan is: move UP to (1,3) to eat the apple, gain a point, and then plan the next move from there. Next turn, I can check the new positions and decide again. But for now, UP is the best move.\n</think>\n\nUP  \nRationale: The closest apple is at (1,3) directly above. Moving UP safely collects it, grows the snake, and avoids immediate threats. Next, consider targeting nearby apples while monitoring enemy movement.  \nStrategy: After eating (1,3), assess remaining apples and possible paths to avoid collisions.  \nDirection: UP"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see where I am now. My snake is at (1,3) with the body at [(1,2)] because I just moved up to eat the apple there. The apples now are at (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). Wait, the initial list had (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). But after eating the one at (1,3), that apple is gone. So the remaining apples are those five minus (1,3)? Wait, no, the initial apples were (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). The apple at (1,3) was part of the board state, but maybe the list in the problem was different. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe user message says \"Apples at: (9, 2), (9, 7), (9, 0), (8, 7), (0, 8)\". But in the board state, there's an A at (1,3) (since the snake was at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)]). Wait, maybe the initial setup had the snake at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)] because it just moved up. So the apple at (1,3) was eaten in the last move. So the remaining apples are the ones listed: (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). So those are the current apples.\n\nSo now, my snake is at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]. The next move is to decide where to go. The available directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nUP from (1,3) would take me to (1,4). Is that safe? The board shows that (1,4) is empty. No snake or apple there. Moving there would not hit anything. But there's no apple, so I won't grow. But moving up would keep me safe and explore towards the top.\n\nDOWN would take me to (1,2), which is my own body. That's a collision, so I can't go DOWN.\n\nLEFT to (0,3). Is that safe? The board shows (0,3) is empty. No snakes there. So moving left is possible. But again, no apple there. The apple at (0,8) is far up. So moving left would be safe but not towards an apple.\n\nRIGHT to (2,3). That's also empty. No immediate threat. But again, no apple there. The closest apples are at (9,2), (8,7), etc. So moving right might be a way to head towards those, but it's a long path.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (9,2) is on the top right, (9,7) and (8,7) are also top right, (9,0) is bottom right, and (0,8) is top left. The apple at (0,8) is at the top left corner. From my current position (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then left to (0,4), then up to (0,5), etc., could eventually reach (0,8). But that's several moves. Alternatively, moving right towards the center might get me closer to other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (0,8) is the closest in terms of vertical distance. From (1,3) to (0,8) is 5 units up and 1 left. But moving up and left would take time. Alternatively, moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), etc., towards (0,8). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe the apples on the right are more reachable.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,2) is at the bottom right. From (1,3), moving right across the board to x=9, y=2. That's 8 steps right and 1 down. But that's a long way. The enemy snake is at (6,6), which is in the middle. So moving towards (9,2) might risk crossing paths with the enemy.\n\nThe apple at (8,7) is at the top right. From (1,3), moving right and up. That's 7 steps right and 4 up. Also a long path. The apple at (9,7) is even further.\n\nThe apple at (0,8) is top left. From (1,3), moving left to (0,3) then up to (0,8). That's 5 up. So 5 moves up. But that's a possible path. However, moving up from (1,3) to (1,4), then (1,5), etc., but that's along the same column. But maybe there's a risk of getting trapped if I go too far up without a plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should head towards the apple at (0,8). Let's see: from (1,3), moving left to (0,3), then up to (0,4), (0,5), etc., until (0,8). That's 5 moves up. But each move up would require checking for safety. Alternatively, moving up first, then left.\n\nBut the immediate next move: if I go UP to (1,4), that's safe. Then next move, I can go UP again to (1,5), and so on. But there's no apple in that path until (0,8). Alternatively, moving RIGHT towards the center might open up more options.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (6,6) with no body. They might be moving towards apples as well. If they head towards (8,7) or (9,7), that's their path. But I'm on the left side, so maybe focusing on (0,8) is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (0,8) is the only one on the left side. So moving towards that makes sense. Let's plan a path.\n\nFrom (1,3):\n\nOption 1: Move LEFT to (0,3), then UP to (0,4), (0,5), etc., until (0,8). That's 5 moves up. But each step, I need to avoid colliding with myself. Since my body is now [(1,3), (1,2)] after moving. Wait, after moving UP to (1,4), the body becomes [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]? Wait, no. Wait, the snake's body is [(1,3), (1,2)] because the head is at (1,3) and the body is [(1,2)]. So when I move, the head moves to the new position, and the body follows. So if I move UP to (1,4), the new body becomes [(1,3), (1,2)]. Then next move, if I move UP again to (1,5), the body becomes [(1,4), (1,3)]. So the tail moves forward each step unless I eat an apple.\n\nBut since there's no apple in the immediate path, moving towards (0,8) would require several steps without growing. But the apple at (0,8) is there. So maybe it's worth the journey.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT towards the center to get closer to other apples. For example, moving RIGHT to (2,3), then (3,3), etc., towards (9,2) or (8,7). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, check if there's any other apple closer. The apples are at (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). The closest in terms of Manhattan distance from (1,3):\n\n- (0,8): |1-0| + |3-8| = 1 +5=6\n- (9,2): 8 +1=9\n- (9,7): 8 +4=12\n- (8,7):7 +4=11\n- (9,0):8 +3=11\n\nSo (0,8) is the closest. So moving towards (0,8) makes sense.\n\nSo the plan is to move LEFT to (0,3), then UP towards (0,8). But first, moving LEFT to (0,3) is safe. Let's check the board state again. The board shows that at column 0, row 8 is an apple (0,8). So moving left to (0,3) is safe. Then from there, moving up each step.\n\nBut wait, moving LEFT from (1,3) to (0,3) is possible. Then next move, UP to (0,4), etc. But each move without an apple won't grow the snake, so the body length remains the same. So the snake's body would be [(0,3), (1,3), (1,2)] after moving left. Wait, no. The snake's body is the previous positions. When the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. So if the snake is at (1,3) with body [(1,2)], moving LEFT to (0,3) would make the new body [(1,3)]. So the tail moves forward. So the body length is maintained unless an apple is eaten.\n\nSince there's no apple at (0,3), moving there would not increase the length. So the body becomes [(1,3)], and the head is at (0,3). Then next move, if I go UP to (0,4), the body becomes [(0,3)], and so on. So the snake's length is 2 (head + 1 body segment) because I ate one apple before. Wait, initial state: the snake was at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)], which is length 2. After moving UP to (1,4), the body becomes [(1,3)], so length remains 2. If I eat an apple, the body grows by one. So since I just ate the apple at (1,3), the snake's length is now 2 (head at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]). Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow. So after moving to (1,3) (the apple), the snake's body becomes [(1,3), (1,2)], making the length 3. Wait, the initial body was [(1,2)] when the head was at (1,3). So after eating the apple, the body grows by one. So the next move, when you move, the tail doesn't move. So the body becomes [(1,3), (1,2)] when you move to a new position. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the growth mechanics.\n\nWhen the snake moves into an apple, it grows by one segment. So the next move, when you move, the tail doesn't advance. So after eating an apple, the snake's length increases by one. So in the previous move, the snake was at (1,2) with body [(1,2)] (head) and [(1,1)]? Wait, no. The initial state after the last move: the snake was at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)]. That implies that the snake had just moved UP from (1,2) to (1,3), eating the apple there, so the body becomes [(1,2)] (the previous head position). So the snake's length is 2 (head + 1 body segment). Then, when moving again, if you don't eat an apple, the body moves forward, so the tail moves. So after moving to a new position without eating, the body becomes the previous head position, and the tail is cut.\n\nBut in this current state, after eating the apple at (1,3), the snake's length is now 2 (head at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]). Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one. So if the snake was length 1 (head only), after eating, it becomes length 2 (head and one body segment). If it was length 2, after eating, it becomes length 3. So in the previous move, the snake was at (1,2) with body [(1,1)] (length 2). Then moved UP to (1,3), ate the apple, so the body becomes [(1,2), (1,1)] (length 3). But according to the user's current state, the snake is at (1,3) with body [(1,2)]. That suggests that the snake's length is 2. So maybe the initial state after the last move was that the snake was at (1,3) with body [(1,2)], implying that it just ate an apple, so the body grew by one. So the length is now 2 (head + 1 body). So when moving next, if you don't eat an apple, the body moves, so the tail (the last segment) is removed. Wait, no. The snake's movement works such that each time it moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. If it eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. If it doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves forward, so the body length remains the same.\n\nSo in the current state, after eating the apple, the snake's body is [(1,2)] (so total length 2). When moving next, if it doesn't eat an apple, the body will become the previous head position, and the tail (1,2) is removed. So the new body would be [(1,3)], and the head moves to the new position. So the length remains 2.\n\nBut this is getting a bit confusing. Let's focus on the current position and possible moves.\n\nCurrent position: head at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]. So the snake's length is 2. The next move can be UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nUP: (1,4). Check if that's safe. The board shows that (1,4) is empty. No snakes or apples there. So moving UP is safe. No apple, so the snake's body becomes [(1,3)], and the head moves to (1,4). Length remains 2.\n\nDOWN: (1,2). That's the body segment. Collision, so can't move DOWN.\n\nLEFT: (0,3). Check if that's safe. The board shows (0,3) is empty. So moving LEFT is safe. No apple there, so body becomes [(1,3)], head at (0,3). Length remains 2.\n\nRIGHT: (2,3). Safe, no apple. Body becomes [(1,3)], head at (2,3). Length remains 2.\n\nSo all possible moves except DOWN are safe. Now, which direction leads towards the nearest apple?\n\nThe nearest apple is (0,8) at Manhattan distance 6. To reach (0,8), moving LEFT to (0,3) then UP through (0,4) to (0,8) would take 5 moves up. Each move up without apples would keep the snake at length 2. But when reaching (0,8), eating the apple would increase the length to 3.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (1,3) to (1,4), then (1,5), etc., towards (0,8) would take longer. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT towards the center to get closer to other apples. For example, moving RIGHT to (2,3), then (3,3), etc., towards (9,2) or (8,7). But those are much further.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (6,6) with no body. They might be moving towards the apples on the right side. So maybe the apples on the right are more contested. The apple at (0,8) is on the left, so maybe it's safer to go for that.\n\nSo the best move is to go LEFT to (0,3) to start heading towards (0,8). That way, I can move up along the left edge to reach the apple. Moving LEFT now is safe and starts the journey towards the closest apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (1,4) keeps me in the same column, but there's no apple there. But maybe there's a path to another apple. However, the closest apple is (0,8), so moving LEFT seems better.\n\nAnother thing to consider: after moving LEFT to (0,3), the next move would be UP to (0,4), then (0,5), etc. Each of those positions is safe as long as there's no obstacle. Since the enemy is at (6,6), they are far away. So the path seems safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (0,3) to start moving towards the apple at (0,8).\n</think>\n\nLEFT  \nRationale: The closest remaining apple is at (0,8). Moving LEFT to (0,3) starts the path upward along the left edge, avoiding self-collision and safely navigating toward the apple.  \nStrategy: Next moves should continue UP along the left column to reach (0,8) while monitoring for new apple spawns or enemy movements.  \nDirection: LEFT"

The enemy snake is at (6,7) with no body, so it's just a head.\n\nFrom my current position (0,3), the available directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- **UP** to (0,4): This is safe. The board shows no obstacles here. Moving up continues the path toward the apple at (0,8).\n- **DOWN** to (0,2): This would be moving back towards my previous position (1,3) which is now part of my body. Wait, my body is at [(1,3)], so (0,2) is empty. Wait, no. My head is at (0,3), and my body is at [(1,3)]. So moving DOWN to (0,2) is safe as it's a new cell. But moving down takes me away from the apple at (0,8).\n- **LEFT** to (-1,3): That's outside the board (x < 0), so it's a wall. Can't do that.\n- **RIGHT** to (1,3): That's my body segment. Collision, so invalid.\n\nSo valid moves are UP and DOWN. Moving UP continues the path toward the apple. Moving DOWN moves away but might explore other areas.

The apples are at (1,3), (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7). The enemy snake is at (6,5) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I should check the positions of the apples relative to my current position. The closest apple is at (1,3), which is directly above me. If I move UP from (1,2) to (1,3), I can eat that apple and grow. That seems like a good immediate target. But I need to make sure that moving there is safe. Since my body is empty, moving into that spot won't hit myself. Also, the enemy snake is at (6,5), which is far away, so no collision risk there. So moving UP to get the apple at (1,3) seems safe and beneficial.\n\nOther apples are further away. The ones at (9,2) and (9,0) are on the right edge. Moving right towards them would take several moves, and I might have to compete with the enemy snake. But since the enemy is at (6,5), maybe they're heading towards other apples. But for the first move, getting the closest apple makes sense.\n\nWait, what about possible future moves? If I go UP to (1,3), then next turn I can look for the next apple. Let's see, after eating (1,3), my body would have a segment. Then I need to plan the next move. But for now, the immediate move is to get the apple. Also, moving UP is safe because there's no obstacle in that direction. The board shows that (1,3) is an apple, so moving there is good.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (2,2) would take me towards the center, but there's no apple there. Moving LEFT would take me to (0,2), which is safe but no apple. Moving DOWN to (1,1) is also safe but no apple. So the best option is UP to get the apple and start growing.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's position. Snake #1 is at (6,5). They might be heading towards the apples at (9,7) or (8,7), but that's on the top right. Since I'm on the left side, maybe I can focus on the apples on the left first. The apple at (1,3) is the closest, so that's the priority.\n\nSo the plan is: move UP to (1,3) to eat the apple, gain a point, and then plan the next move from there. Next turn, I can check the new positions and decide again. But for now, UP is the best move.\n</think>\n\nUP  \nRationale: The closest apple is at (1,3) directly above. Moving UP safely collects it, grows the snake, and avoids immediate threats. Next, consider targeting nearby apples while monitoring enemy movement.  \nStrategy: After eating (1,3), assess remaining apples and possible paths to avoid collisions.  \nDirection: UP"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see where I am now. My snake is at (1,3) with the body at [(1,2)] because I just moved up to eat the apple there. The apples now are at (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). Wait, the initial list had (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). But after eating the one at (1,3), that apple is gone. So the remaining apples are those five minus (1,3)? Wait, no, the initial apples were (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). The apple at (1,3) was part of the board state, but maybe the list in the problem was different. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe user message says \"Apples at: (9, 2), (9, 7), (9, 0), (8, 7), (0, 8)\". But in the board state, there's an A at (1,3) (since the snake was at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)]). Wait, maybe the initial setup had the snake at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)] because it just moved up. So the apple at (1,3) was eaten in the last move. So the remaining apples are the ones listed: (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). So those are the current apples.\n\nSo now, my snake is at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]. The next move is to decide where to go. The available directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nUP from (1,3) would take me to (1,4). Is that safe? The board shows that (1,4) is empty. No snake or apple there. Moving there would not hit anything. But there's no apple, so I won't grow. But moving up would keep me safe and explore towards the top.\n\nDOWN would take me to (1,2), which is my own body. That's a collision, so I can't go DOWN.\n\nLEFT to (0,3). Is that safe? The board shows (0,3) is empty. No snakes there. So moving left is possible. But again, no apple there. The apple at (0,8) is far up. So moving left would be safe but not towards an apple.\n\nRIGHT to (2,3). That's also empty. No immediate threat. But again, no apple there. The closest apples are at (9,2), (8,7), etc. So moving right might be a way to head towards those, but it's a long path.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (9,2) is on the top right, (9,7) and (8,7) are also top right, (9,0) is bottom right, and (0,8) is top left. The apple at (0,8) is at the top left corner. From my current position (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then left to (0,4), then up to (0,5), etc., could eventually reach (0,8). But that's several moves. Alternatively, moving right towards the center might get me closer to other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (0,8) is the closest in terms of vertical distance. From (1,3) to (0,8) is 5 units up and 1 left. But moving up and left would take time. Alternatively, moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), etc., towards (0,8). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe the apples on the right are more reachable.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,2) is at the bottom right. From (1,3), moving right across the board to x=9, y=2. That's 8 steps right and 1 down. But that's a long way. The enemy snake is at (6,6), which is in the middle. So moving towards (9,2) might risk crossing paths with the enemy.\n\nThe apple at (8,7) is at the top right. From (1,3), moving right and up. That's 7 steps right and 4 up. Also a long path. The apple at (9,7) is even further.\n\nThe apple at (0,8) is top left. From (1,3), moving left to (0,3) then up to (0,8). That's 5 up. So 5 moves up. But that's a possible path. However, moving up from (1,3) to (1,4), then (1,5), etc., but that's along the same column. But maybe there's a risk of getting trapped if I go too far up without a plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should head towards the apple at (0,8). Let's see: from (1,3), moving left to (0,3), then up to (0,4), (0,5), etc., until (0,8). That's 5 moves up. But each move up would require checking for safety. Alternatively, moving up first, then left.\n\nBut the immediate next move: if I go UP to (1,4), that's safe. Then next move, I can go UP again to (1,5), and so on. But there's no apple in that path until (0,8). Alternatively, moving RIGHT towards the center might open up more options.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (6,6) with no body. They might be moving towards apples as well. If they head towards (8,7) or (9,7), that's their path. But I'm on the left side, so maybe focusing on (0,8) is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (0,8) is the only one on the left side. So moving towards that makes sense. Let's plan a path.\n\nFrom (1,3):\n\nOption 1: Move LEFT to (0,3), then UP to (0,4), (0,5), etc., until (0,8). That's 5 moves up. But each step, I need to avoid colliding with myself. Since my body is now [(1,3), (1,2)] after moving. Wait, after moving UP to (1,4), the body becomes [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]? Wait, no. Wait, the snake's body is [(1,3), (1,2)] because the head is at (1,3) and the body is [(1,2)]. So when I move, the head moves to the new position, and the body follows. So if I move UP to (1,4), the new body becomes [(1,3), (1,2)]. Then next move, if I move UP again to (1,5), the body becomes [(1,4), (1,3)]. So the tail moves forward each step unless I eat an apple.\n\nBut since there's no apple in the immediate path, moving towards (0,8) would require several steps without growing. But the apple at (0,8) is there. So maybe it's worth the journey.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT towards the center to get closer to other apples. For example, moving RIGHT to (2,3), then (3,3), etc., towards (9,2) or (8,7). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, check if there's any other apple closer. The apples are at (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). The closest in terms of Manhattan distance from (1,3):\n\n- (0,8): |1-0| + |3-8| = 1 +5=6\n- (9,2): 8 +1=9\n- (9,7): 8 +4=12\n- (8,7):7 +4=11\n- (9,0):8 +3=11\n\nSo (0,8) is the closest. So moving towards (0,8) makes sense.\n\nSo the plan is to move LEFT to (0,3), then UP towards (0,8). But first, moving LEFT to (0,3) is safe. Let's check the board state again. The board shows that at column 0, row 8 is an apple (0,8). So moving left to (0,3) is safe. Then from there, moving up each step.\n\nBut wait, moving LEFT from (1,3) to (0,3) is possible. Then next move, UP to (0,4), etc. But each move without an apple won't grow the snake, so the body length remains the same. So the snake's body would be [(0,3), (1,3), (1,2)] after moving left. Wait, no. The snake's body is the previous positions. When the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. So if the snake is at (1,3) with body [(1,2)], moving LEFT to (0,3) would make the new body [(1,3)]. So the tail moves forward. So the body length is maintained unless an apple is eaten.\n\nSince there's no apple at (0,3), moving there would not increase the length. So the body becomes [(1,3)], and the head is at (0,3). Then next move, if I go UP to (0,4), the body becomes [(0,3)], and so on. So the snake's length is 2 (head + 1 body segment) because I ate one apple before. Wait, initial state: the snake was at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)], which is length 2. After moving UP to (1,4), the body becomes [(1,3)], so length remains 2. If I eat an apple, the body grows by one. So since I just ate the apple at (1,3), the snake's length is now 2 (head at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]). Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow. So after moving to (1,3) (the apple), the snake's body becomes [(1,3), (1,2)], making the length 3. Wait, the initial body was [(1,2)] when the head was at (1,3). So after eating the apple, the body grows by one. So the next move, when you move, the tail doesn't move. So the body becomes [(1,3), (1,2)] when you move to a new position. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the growth mechanics.\n\nWhen the snake moves into an apple, it grows by one segment. So the next move, when you move, the tail doesn't advance. So after eating an apple, the snake's length increases by one. So in the previous move, the snake was at (1,2) with body [(1,2)] (head) and [(1,1)]? Wait, no. The initial state after the last move: the snake was at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)]. That implies that the snake had just moved UP from (1,2) to (1,3), eating the apple there, so the body becomes [(1,2)] (the previous head position). So the snake's length is 2 (head + 1 body segment). Then, when moving again, if you don't eat an apple, the body moves forward, so the tail moves. So after moving to a new position without eating, the body becomes the previous head position, and the tail is cut.\n\nBut in this current state, after eating the apple at (1,3), the snake's length is now 2 (head at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]). Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one. So if the snake was length 1 (head only), after eating, it becomes length 2 (head and one body segment). If it was length 2, after eating, it becomes length 3. So in the previous move, the snake was at (1,2) with body [(1,1)] (length 2). Then moved UP to (1,3), ate the apple, so the body becomes [(1,2), (1,1)] (length 3). But according to the user's current state, the snake is at (1,3) with body [(1,2)]. That suggests that the snake's length is 2. So maybe the initial state after the last move was that the snake was at (1,3) with body [(1,2)], implying that it just ate an apple, so the body grew by one. So the length is now 2 (head + 1 body). So when moving next, if you don't eat an apple, the body moves, so the tail (the last segment) is removed. Wait, no. The snake's movement works such that each time it moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. If it eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. If it doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves forward, so the body length remains the same.\n\nSo in the current state, after eating the apple, the snake's body is [(1,2)] (so total length 2). When moving next, if it doesn't eat an apple, the body will become the previous head position, and the tail (1,2) is removed. So the new body would be [(1,3)], and the head moves to the new position. So the length remains 2.\n\nBut this is getting a bit confusing. Let's focus on the current position and possible moves.\n\nCurrent position: head at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]. So the snake's length is 2. The next move can be UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nUP: (1,4). Check if that's safe. The board shows that (1,4) is empty. No snakes or apples there. So moving UP is safe. No apple, so the snake's body becomes [(1,3)], and the head moves to (1,4). Length remains 2.\n\nDOWN: (1,2). That's the body segment. Collision, so can't move DOWN.\n\nLEFT: (0,3). Check if that's safe. The board shows (0,3) is empty. So moving LEFT is safe. No apple there, so body becomes [(1,3)], head at (0,3). Length remains 2.\n\nRIGHT: (2,3). Safe, no apple. Body becomes [(1,3)], head at (2,3). Length remains 2.\n\nSo all possible moves except DOWN are safe. Now, which direction leads towards the nearest apple?\n\nThe nearest apple is (0,8) at Manhattan distance 6. To reach (0,8), moving LEFT to (0,3) then UP through (0,4) to (0,8) would take 5 moves up. Each move up without apples would keep the snake at length 2. But when reaching (0,8), eating the apple would increase the length to 3.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (1,3) to (1,4), then (1,5), etc., towards (0,8) would take longer. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT towards the center to get closer to other apples. For example, moving RIGHT to (2,3), then (3,3), etc., towards (9,2) or (8,7). But those are much further.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (6,6) with no body. They might be moving towards the apples on the right side. So maybe the apples on the right are more contested. The apple at (0,8) is on the left, so maybe it's safer to go for that.\n\nSo the best move is to go LEFT to (0,3) to start heading towards (0,8). That way, I can move up along the left edge to reach the apple. Moving LEFT now is safe and starts the journey towards the closest apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (1,4) keeps me in the same column, but there's no apple there. But maybe there's a path to another apple. However, the closest apple is (0,8), so moving LEFT seems better.\n\nAnother thing to consider: after moving LEFT to (0,3), the next move would be UP to (0,4), then (0,5), etc. Each of those positions is safe as long as there's no obstacle. Since the enemy is at (6,6), they are far away. So the path seems safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (0,3) to start moving towards the apple at (0,8).\n</think>\n\nLEFT  \nRationale: The closest remaining apple is at (0,8). Moving LEFT to (0,3) starts the path upward along the left edge, avoiding self-collision and safely navigating toward the apple.  \nStrategy: Next moves should continue UP along the left column to reach (0,8) while monitoring for new apple spawns or enemy movements.  \nDirection: LEFT"

Let's check each:\n\n- **UP** to (0,4): This is safe. The board shows no obstacles here. Moving up continues the path toward the apple at (0,8).\n- **DOWN** to (0,2): This would be moving back towards my previous position (1,3) which is now part of my body. Wait, my body is at [(1,3)], so (0,2) is empty. Wait, no. My head is at (0,3), and my body is at [(1,3)]. So moving DOWN to (0,2) is safe as it's a new cell.

The apples are at (1,3), (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7). The enemy snake is at (6,5) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I should check the positions of the apples relative to my current position. The closest apple is at (1,3), which is directly above me. If I move UP from (1,2) to (1,3), I can eat that apple and grow. That seems like a good immediate target. But I need to make sure that moving there is safe. Since my body is empty, moving into that spot won't hit myself. Also, the enemy snake is at (6,5), which is far away, so no collision risk there. So moving UP to get the apple at (1,3) seems safe and beneficial.\n\nOther apples are further away. The ones at (9,2) and (9,0) are on the right edge. Moving right towards them would take several moves, and I might have to compete with the enemy snake. But since the enemy is at (6,5), maybe they're heading towards other apples. But for the first move, getting the closest apple makes sense.\n\nWait, what about possible future moves? If I go UP to (1,3), then next turn I can look for the next apple. Let's see, after eating (1,3), my body would have a segment. Then I need to plan the next move. But for now, the immediate move is to get the apple. Also, moving UP is safe because there's no obstacle in that direction. The board shows that (1,3) is an apple, so moving there is good.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (2,2) would take me towards the center, but there's no apple there. Moving LEFT would take me to (0,2), which is safe but no apple. Moving DOWN to (1,1) is also safe but no apple. So the best option is UP to get the apple and start growing.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's position. Snake #1 is at (6,5). They might be heading towards the apples at (9,7) or (8,7), but that's on the top right. Since I'm on the left side, maybe I can focus on the apples on the left first. The apple at (1,3) is the closest, so that's the priority.\n\nSo the plan is: move UP to (1,3) to eat the apple, gain a point, and then plan the next move from there. Next turn, I can check the new positions and decide again. But for now, UP is the best move.\n</think>\n\nUP  \nRationale: The closest apple is at (1,3) directly above. Moving UP safely collects it, grows the snake, and avoids immediate threats. Next, consider targeting nearby apples while monitoring enemy movement.  \nStrategy: After eating (1,3), assess remaining apples and possible paths to avoid collisions.  \nDirection: UP"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see where I am now. My snake is at (1,3) with the body at [(1,2)] because I just moved up to eat the apple there. The apples now are at (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). Wait, the initial list had (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). But after eating the one at (1,3), that apple is gone. So the remaining apples are those five minus (1,3)? Wait, no, the initial apples were (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). The apple at (1,3) was part of the board state, but maybe the list in the problem was different. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe user message says \"Apples at: (9, 2), (9, 7), (9, 0), (8, 7), (0, 8)\". But in the board state, there's an A at (1,3) (since the snake was at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)]). Wait, maybe the initial setup had the snake at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)] because it just moved up. So the apple at (1,3) was eaten in the last move. So the remaining apples are the ones listed: (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). So those are the current apples.\n\nSo now, my snake is at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]. The next move is to decide where to go. The available directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nUP from (1,3) would take me to (1,4). Is that safe? The board shows that (1,4) is empty. No snake or apple there. Moving there would not hit anything. But there's no apple, so I won't grow. But moving up would keep me safe and explore towards the top.\n\nDOWN would take me to (1,2), which is my own body. That's a collision, so I can't go DOWN.\n\nLEFT to (0,3). Is that safe? The board shows (0,3) is empty. No snakes there. So moving left is possible. But again, no apple there. The apple at (0,8) is far up. So moving left would be safe but not towards an apple.\n\nRIGHT to (2,3). That's also empty. No immediate threat. But again, no apple there. The closest apples are at (9,2), (8,7), etc. So moving right might be a way to head towards those, but it's a long path.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (9,2) is on the top right, (9,7) and (8,7) are also top right, (9,0) is bottom right, and (0,8) is top left. The apple at (0,8) is at the top left corner. From my current position (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then left to (0,4), then up to (0,5), etc., could eventually reach (0,8). But that's several moves. Alternatively, moving right towards the center might get me closer to other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (0,8) is the closest in terms of vertical distance. From (1,3) to (0,8) is 5 units up and 1 left. But moving up and left would take time. Alternatively, moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), etc., towards (0,8). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe the apples on the right are more reachable.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,2) is at the bottom right. From (1,3), moving right across the board to x=9, y=2. That's 8 steps right and 1 down. But that's a long way. The enemy snake is at (6,6), which is in the middle. So moving towards (9,2) might risk crossing paths with the enemy.\n\nThe apple at (8,7) is at the top right. From (1,3), moving right and up. That's 7 steps right and 4 up. Also a long path. The apple at (9,7) is even further.\n\nThe apple at (0,8) is top left. From (1,3), moving left to (0,3) then up to (0,8). That's 5 up. So 5 moves up. But that's a possible path. However, moving up from (1,3) to (1,4), then (1,5), etc., but that's along the same column. But maybe there's a risk of getting trapped if I go too far up without a plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should head towards the apple at (0,8). Let's see: from (1,3), moving left to (0,3), then up to (0,4), (0,5), etc., until (0,8). That's 5 moves up. But each move up would require checking for safety. Alternatively, moving up first, then left.\n\nBut the immediate next move: if I go UP to (1,4), that's safe. Then next move, I can go UP again to (1,5), and so on. But there's no apple in that path until (0,8). Alternatively, moving RIGHT towards the center might open up more options.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (6,6) with no body. They might be moving towards apples as well. If they head towards (8,7) or (9,7), that's their path. But I'm on the left side, so maybe focusing on (0,8) is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (0,8) is the only one on the left side. So moving towards that makes sense. Let's plan a path.\n\nFrom (1,3):\n\nOption 1: Move LEFT to (0,3), then UP to (0,4), (0,5), etc., until (0,8). That's 5 moves up. But each step, I need to avoid colliding with myself. Since my body is now [(1,3), (1,2)] after moving. Wait, after moving UP to (1,4), the body becomes [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]? Wait, no. Wait, the snake's body is [(1,3), (1,2)] because the head is at (1,3) and the body is [(1,2)]. So when I move, the head moves to the new position, and the body follows. So if I move UP to (1,4), the new body becomes [(1,3), (1,2)]. Then next move, if I move UP again to (1,5), the body becomes [(1,4), (1,3)]. So the tail moves forward each step unless I eat an apple.\n\nBut since there's no apple in the immediate path, moving towards (0,8) would require several steps without growing. But the apple at (0,8) is there. So maybe it's worth the journey.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT towards the center to get closer to other apples. For example, moving RIGHT to (2,3), then (3,3), etc., towards (9,2) or (8,7). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, check if there's any other apple closer. The apples are at (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). The closest in terms of Manhattan distance from (1,3):\n\n- (0,8): |1-0| + |3-8| = 1 +5=6\n- (9,2): 8 +1=9\n- (9,7): 8 +4=12\n- (8,7):7 +4=11\n- (9,0):8 +3=11\n\nSo (0,8) is the closest. So moving towards (0,8) makes sense.\n\nSo the plan is to move LEFT to (0,3), then UP towards (0,8). But first, moving LEFT to (0,3) is safe. Let's check the board state again. The board shows that at column 0, row 8 is an apple (0,8). So moving left to (0,3) is safe. Then from there, moving up each step.\n\nBut wait, moving LEFT from (1,3) to (0,3) is possible. Then next move, UP to (0,4), etc. But each move without an apple won't grow the snake, so the body length remains the same. So the snake's body would be [(0,3), (1,3), (1,2)] after moving left. Wait, no. The snake's body is the previous positions. When the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. So if the snake is at (1,3) with body [(1,2)], moving LEFT to (0,3) would make the new body [(1,3)]. So the tail moves forward. So the body length is maintained unless an apple is eaten.\n\nSince there's no apple at (0,3), moving there would not increase the length. So the body becomes [(1,3)], and the head is at (0,3). Then next move, if I go UP to (0,4), the body becomes [(0,3)], and so on. So the snake's length is 2 (head + 1 body segment) because I ate one apple before. Wait, initial state: the snake was at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)], which is length 2. After moving UP to (1,4), the body becomes [(1,3)], so length remains 2. If I eat an apple, the body grows by one. So since I just ate the apple at (1,3), the snake's length is now 2 (head at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]). Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow. So after moving to (1,3) (the apple), the snake's body becomes [(1,3), (1,2)], making the length 3. Wait, the initial body was [(1,2)] when the head was at (1,3). So after eating the apple, the body grows by one. So the next move, when you move, the tail doesn't move. So the body becomes [(1,3), (1,2)] when you move to a new position. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the growth mechanics.\n\nWhen the snake moves into an apple, it grows by one segment. So the next move, when you move, the tail doesn't advance. So after eating an apple, the snake's length increases by one. So in the previous move, the snake was at (1,2) with body [(1,2)] (head) and [(1,1)]? Wait, no. The initial state after the last move: the snake was at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)]. That implies that the snake had just moved UP from (1,2) to (1,3), eating the apple there, so the body becomes [(1,2)] (the previous head position). So the snake's length is 2 (head + 1 body segment). Then, when moving again, if you don't eat an apple, the body moves forward, so the tail moves. So after moving to a new position without eating, the body becomes the previous head position, and the tail is cut.\n\nBut in this current state, after eating the apple at (1,3), the snake's length is now 2 (head at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]). Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one. So if the snake was length 1 (head only), after eating, it becomes length 2 (head and one body segment). If it was length 2, after eating, it becomes length 3. So in the previous move, the snake was at (1,2) with body [(1,1)] (length 2). Then moved UP to (1,3), ate the apple, so the body becomes [(1,2), (1,1)] (length 3). But according to the user's current state, the snake is at (1,3) with body [(1,2)]. That suggests that the snake's length is 2. So maybe the initial state after the last move was that the snake was at (1,3) with body [(1,2)], implying that it just ate an apple, so the body grew by one. So the length is now 2 (head + 1 body). So when moving next, if you don't eat an apple, the body moves, so the tail (the last segment) is removed. Wait, no. The snake's movement works such that each time it moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. If it eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. If it doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves forward, so the body length remains the same.\n\nSo in the current state, after eating the apple, the snake's body is [(1,2)] (so total length 2). When moving next, if it doesn't eat an apple, the body will become the previous head position, and the tail (1,2) is removed. So the new body would be [(1,3)], and the head moves to the new position. So the length remains 2.\n\nBut this is getting a bit confusing. Let's focus on the current position and possible moves.\n\nCurrent position: head at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]. So the snake's length is 2. The next move can be UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nUP: (1,4). Check if that's safe. The board shows that (1,4) is empty. No snakes or apples there. So moving UP is safe. No apple, so the snake's body becomes [(1,3)], and the head moves to (1,4). Length remains 2.\n\nDOWN: (1,2). That's the body segment. Collision, so can't move DOWN.\n\nLEFT: (0,3). Check if that's safe. The board shows (0,3) is empty. So moving LEFT is safe. No apple there, so body becomes [(1,3)], head at (0,3). Length remains 2.\n\nRIGHT: (2,3). Safe, no apple. Body becomes [(1,3)], head at (2,3). Length remains 2.\n\nSo all possible moves except DOWN are safe. Now, which direction leads towards the nearest apple?\n\nThe nearest apple is (0,8) at Manhattan distance 6. To reach (0,8), moving LEFT to (0,3) then UP through (0,4) to (0,8) would take 5 moves up. Each move up without apples would keep the snake at length 2. But when reaching (0,8), eating the apple would increase the length to 3.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (1,3) to (1,4), then (1,5), etc., towards (0,8) would take longer. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT towards the center to get closer to other apples. For example, moving RIGHT to (2,3), then (3,3), etc., towards (9,2) or (8,7). But those are much further.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (6,6) with no body. They might be moving towards the apples on the right side. So maybe the apples on the right are more contested. The apple at (0,8) is on the left, so maybe it's safer to go for that.\n\nSo the best move is to go LEFT to (0,3) to start heading towards (0,8). That way, I can move up along the left edge to reach the apple. Moving LEFT now is safe and starts the journey towards the closest apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (1,4) keeps me in the same column, but there's no apple there. But maybe there's a path to another apple. However, the closest apple is (0,8), so moving LEFT seems better.\n\nAnother thing to consider: after moving LEFT to (0,3), the next move would be UP to (0,4), then (0,5), etc. Each of those positions is safe as long as there's no obstacle. Since the enemy is at (6,6), they are far away. So the path seems safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (0,3) to start moving towards the apple at (0,8).\n</think>\n\nLEFT  \nRationale: The closest remaining apple is at (0,8). Moving LEFT to (0,3) starts the path upward along the left edge, avoiding self-collision and safely navigating toward the apple.  \nStrategy: Next moves should continue UP along the left column to reach (0,8) while monitoring for new apple spawns or enemy movements.  \nDirection: LEFT"

Moving up continues the path toward the apple at (0,8).\n- **DOWN** to (0,2): This would be moving back towards my previous position (1,3) which is now part of my body.

Let me check for any obstacles or threats.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (6,9), which is on the top right. Since their body is empty, they might be moving towards apples as well. But they're far from my current path. The other apples are on the right side, but I'm focused on the closest one at (0,8).\n\nPossible moves from (0,5) are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each:\n\n- **UP** to (0,6): Empty. Safe. Progress towards the apple.\n- **DOWN** to (0,4): That's my body segment. Can't go there.\n- **LEFT** to (-1,5): Out of bounds. Wall collision.\n- **RIGHT** to (1,5): Empty. But moving right takes me away from the apple. However, maybe there's a strategic reason to go right? The apples on the right are at (8,7) and (9,0), but those are far. Not worth the detour when there's a closer apple.\n\nSo the best move is UP again. Continuing the upward path towards (0,8). Need to make sure that after getting the apple, I can safely maneuver without trapping myself. But for the next immediate move, UP is the clear choice. No threats detected in that direction. The enemy is not near, and the path is clear. \n\nStrategy: Keep moving UP to reach the apple at (0,8) as quickly as possible. After consuming it, plan the next move towards another apple, possibly the ones on the right side, but need to avoid walls and self-collision. For now, focus on the immediate goal.\n</think>\n\nUP  \nRationale: Continuing upward to reach the apple at (0,8). Path remains clear, and no immediate threats detected.  \nStrategy: After securing (0,8), consider moving right toward other apples while avoiding potential collisions.  \nDirection: UP"

The apples are at (1,3), (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7). The enemy snake is at (6,5) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I should check the positions of the apples relative to my current position. The closest apple is at (1,3), which is directly above me. If I move UP from (1,2) to (1,3), I can eat that apple and grow. That seems like a good immediate target. But I need to make sure that moving there is safe. Since my body is empty, moving into that spot won't hit myself. Also, the enemy snake is at (6,5), which is far away, so no collision risk there. So moving UP to get the apple at (1,3) seems safe and beneficial.\n\nOther apples are further away. The ones at (9,2) and (9,0) are on the right edge. Moving right towards them would take several moves, and I might have to compete with the enemy snake. But since the enemy is at (6,5), maybe they're heading towards other apples. But for the first move, getting the closest apple makes sense.\n\nWait, what about possible future moves? If I go UP to (1,3), then next turn I can look for the next apple. Let's see, after eating (1,3), my body would have a segment. Then I need to plan the next move. But for now, the immediate move is to get the apple. Also, moving UP is safe because there's no obstacle in that direction. The board shows that (1,3) is an apple, so moving there is good.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (2,2) would take me towards the center, but there's no apple there. Moving LEFT would take me to (0,2), which is safe but no apple. Moving DOWN to (1,1) is also safe but no apple. So the best option is UP to get the apple and start growing.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's position. Snake #1 is at (6,5). They might be heading towards the apples at (9,7) or (8,7), but that's on the top right. Since I'm on the left side, maybe I can focus on the apples on the left first. The apple at (1,3) is the closest, so that's the priority.\n\nSo the plan is: move UP to (1,3) to eat the apple, gain a point, and then plan the next move from there. Next turn, I can check the new positions and decide again. But for now, UP is the best move.\n</think>\n\nUP  \nRationale: The closest apple is at (1,3) directly above. Moving UP safely collects it, grows the snake, and avoids immediate threats. Next, consider targeting nearby apples while monitoring enemy movement.  \nStrategy: After eating (1,3), assess remaining apples and possible paths to avoid collisions.  \nDirection: UP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see where I am now. My snake is at (1,3) with the body at [(1,2)] because I just moved up to eat the apple there. The apples now are at (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). Wait, the initial list had (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). But after eating the one at (1,3), that apple is gone. So the remaining apples are those five minus (1,3)? Wait, no, the initial apples were (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). The apple at (1,3) was part of the board state, but maybe the list in the problem was different. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe user message says \"Apples at: (9, 2), (9, 7), (9, 0), (8, 7), (0, 8)\". But in the board state, there's an A at (1,3) (since the snake was at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)]). Wait, maybe the initial setup had the snake at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)] because it just moved up. So the apple at (1,3) was eaten in the last move. So the remaining apples are the ones listed: (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). So those are the current apples.\n\nSo now, my snake is at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]. The next move is to decide where to go. The available directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nUP from (1,3) would take me to (1,4). Is that safe? The board shows that (1,4) is empty. No snake or apple there. Moving there would not hit anything. But there's no apple, so I won't grow. But moving up would keep me safe and explore towards the top.\n\nDOWN would take me to (1,2), which is my own body. That's a collision, so I can't go DOWN.\n\nLEFT to (0,3). Is that safe? The board shows (0,3) is empty. No snakes there. So moving left is possible. But again, no apple there. The apple at (0,8) is far up. So moving left would be safe but not towards an apple.\n\nRIGHT to (2,3). That's also empty. No immediate threat. But again, no apple there. The closest apples are at (9,2), (8,7), etc. So moving right might be a way to head towards those, but it's a long path.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (9,2) is on the top right, (9,7) and (8,7) are also top right, (9,0) is bottom right, and (0,8) is top left. The apple at (0,8) is at the top left corner. From my current position (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then left to (0,4), then up to (0,5), etc., could eventually reach (0,8). But that's several moves. Alternatively, moving right towards the center might get me closer to other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (0,8) is the closest in terms of vertical distance. From (1,3) to (0,8) is 5 units up and 1 left. But moving up and left would take time. Alternatively, moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), etc., towards (0,8). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe the apples on the right are more reachable.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,2) is at the bottom right. From (1,3), moving right across the board to x=9, y=2. That's 8 steps right and 1 down. But that's a long way. The enemy snake is at (6,6), which is in the middle. So moving towards (9,2) might risk crossing paths with the enemy.\n\nThe apple at (8,7) is at the top right. From (1,3), moving right and up. That's 7 steps right and 4 up. Also a long path. The apple at (9,7) is even further.\n\nThe apple at (0,8) is top left. From (1,3), moving left to (0,3) then up to (0,8). That's 5 up. So 5 moves up. But that's a possible path. However, moving up from (1,3) to (1,4), then (1,5), etc., but that's along the same column. But maybe there's a risk of getting trapped if I go too far up without a plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should head towards the apple at (0,8). Let's see: from (1,3), moving left to (0,3), then up to (0,4), (0,5), etc., until (0,8). That's 5 moves up. But each move up would require checking for safety. Alternatively, moving up first, then left.\n\nBut the immediate next move: if I go UP to (1,4), that's safe. Then next move, I can go UP again to (1,5), and so on. But there's no apple in that path until (0,8). Alternatively, moving RIGHT towards the center might open up more options.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (6,6) with no body. They might be moving towards apples as well. If they head towards (8,7) or (9,7), that's their path. But I'm on the left side, so maybe focusing on (0,8) is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (0,8) is the only one on the left side. So moving towards that makes sense. Let's plan a path.\n\nFrom (1,3):\n\nOption 1: Move LEFT to (0,3), then UP to (0,4), (0,5), etc., until (0,8). That's 5 moves up. But each step, I need to avoid colliding with myself. Since my body is now [(1,3), (1,2)] after moving. Wait, after moving UP to (1,4), the body becomes [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]? Wait, no. Wait, the snake's body is [(1,3), (1,2)] because the head is at (1,3) and the body is [(1,2)]. So when I move, the head moves to the new position, and the body follows. So if I move UP to (1,4), the new body becomes [(1,3), (1,2)]. Then next move, if I move UP again to (1,5), the body becomes [(1,4), (1,3)]. So the tail moves forward each step unless I eat an apple.\n\nBut since there's no apple in the immediate path, moving towards (0,8) would require several steps without growing. But the apple at (0,8) is there. So maybe it's worth the journey.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT towards the center to get closer to other apples. For example, moving RIGHT to (2,3), then (3,3), etc., towards (9,2) or (8,7). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, check if there's any other apple closer. The apples are at (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). The closest in terms of Manhattan distance from (1,3):\n\n- (0,8): |1-0| + |3-8| = 1 +5=6\n- (9,2): 8 +1=9\n- (9,7): 8 +4=12\n- (8,7):7 +4=11\n- (9,0):8 +3=11\n\nSo (0,8) is the closest. So moving towards (0,8) makes sense.\n\nSo the plan is to move LEFT to (0,3), then UP towards (0,8). But first, moving LEFT to (0,3) is safe. Let's check the board state again. The board shows that at column 0, row 8 is an apple (0,8). So moving left to (0,3) is safe. Then from there, moving up each step.\n\nBut wait, moving LEFT from (1,3) to (0,3) is possible. Then next move, UP to (0,4), etc. But each move without an apple won't grow the snake, so the body length remains the same. So the snake's body would be [(0,3), (1,3), (1,2)] after moving left. Wait, no. The snake's body is the previous positions. When the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. So if the snake is at (1,3) with body [(1,2)], moving LEFT to (0,3) would make the new body [(1,3)]. So the tail moves forward. So the body length is maintained unless an apple is eaten.\n\nSince there's no apple at (0,3), moving there would not increase the length. So the body becomes [(1,3)], and the head is at (0,3). Then next move, if I go UP to (0,4), the body becomes [(0,3)], and so on. So the snake's length is 2 (head + 1 body segment) because I ate one apple before. Wait, initial state: the snake was at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)], which is length 2. After moving UP to (1,4), the body becomes [(1,3)], so length remains 2. If I eat an apple, the body grows by one. So since I just ate the apple at (1,3), the snake's length is now 2 (head at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]). Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow. So after moving to (1,3) (the apple), the snake's body becomes [(1,3), (1,2)], making the length 3. Wait, the initial body was [(1,2)] when the head was at (1,3). So after eating the apple, the body grows by one. So the next move, when you move, the tail doesn't move. So the body becomes [(1,3), (1,2)] when you move to a new position. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the growth mechanics.\n\nWhen the snake moves into an apple, it grows by one segment. So the next move, when you move, the tail doesn't advance. So after eating an apple, the snake's length increases by one. So in the previous move, the snake was at (1,2) with body [(1,2)] (head) and [(1,1)]? Wait, no. The initial state after the last move: the snake was at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)]. That implies that the snake had just moved UP from (1,2) to (1,3), eating the apple there, so the body becomes [(1,2)] (the previous head position). So the snake's length is 2 (head + 1 body segment). Then, when moving again, if you don't eat an apple, the body moves forward, so the tail moves. So after moving to a new position without eating, the body becomes the previous head position, and the tail is cut.\n\nBut in this current state, after eating the apple at (1,3), the snake's length is now 2 (head at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]). Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one. So if the snake was length 1 (head only), after eating, it becomes length 2 (head and one body segment). If it was length 2, after eating, it becomes length 3. So in the previous move, the snake was at (1,2) with body [(1,1)] (length 2). Then moved UP to (1,3), ate the apple, so the body becomes [(1,2), (1,1)] (length 3). But according to the user's current state, the snake is at (1,3) with body [(1,2)]. That suggests that the snake's length is 2. So maybe the initial state after the last move was that the snake was at (1,3) with body [(1,2)], implying that it just ate an apple, so the body grew by one. So the length is now 2 (head + 1 body). So when moving next, if you don't eat an apple, the body moves, so the tail (the last segment) is removed. Wait, no. The snake's movement works such that each time it moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. If it eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. If it doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves forward, so the body length remains the same.\n\nSo in the current state, after eating the apple, the snake's body is [(1,2)] (so total length 2). When moving next, if it doesn't eat an apple, the body will become the previous head position, and the tail (1,2) is removed. So the new body would be [(1,3)], and the head moves to the new position. So the length remains 2.\n\nBut this is getting a bit confusing. Let's focus on the current position and possible moves.\n\nCurrent position: head at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]. So the snake's length is 2. The next move can be UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nUP: (1,4). Check if that's safe. The board shows that (1,4) is empty. No snakes or apples there. So moving UP is safe. No apple, so the snake's body becomes [(1,3)], and the head moves to (1,4). Length remains 2.\n\nDOWN: (1,2). That's the body segment. Collision, so can't move DOWN.\n\nLEFT: (0,3). Check if that's safe. The board shows (0,3) is empty. So moving LEFT is safe. No apple there, so body becomes [(1,3)], head at (0,3). Length remains 2.\n\nRIGHT: (2,3). Safe, no apple. Body becomes [(1,3)], head at (2,3). Length remains 2.\n\nSo all possible moves except DOWN are safe. Now, which direction leads towards the nearest apple?\n\nThe nearest apple is (0,8) at Manhattan distance 6. To reach (0,8), moving LEFT to (0,3) then UP through (0,4) to (0,8) would take 5 moves up. Each move up without apples would keep the snake at length 2. But when reaching (0,8), eating the apple would increase the length to 3.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (1,3) to (1,4), then (1,5), etc., towards (0,8) would take longer. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT towards the center to get closer to other apples. For example, moving RIGHT to (2,3), then (3,3), etc., towards (9,2) or (8,7). But those are much further.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (6,6) with no body. They might be moving towards the apples on the right side. So maybe the apples on the right are more contested. The apple at (0,8) is on the left, so maybe it's safer to go for that.\n\nSo the best move is to go LEFT to (0,3) to start heading towards (0,8). That way, I can move up along the left edge to reach the apple. Moving LEFT now is safe and starts the journey towards the closest apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (1,4) keeps me in the same column, but there's no apple there. But maybe there's a path to another apple. However, the closest apple is (0,8), so moving LEFT seems better.\n\nAnother thing to consider: after moving LEFT to (0,3), the next move would be UP to (0,4), then (0,5), etc. Each of those positions is safe as long as there's no obstacle. Since the enemy is at (6,6), they are far away. So the path seems safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (0,3) to start moving towards the apple at (0,8).\n</think>\n\nLEFT  \nRationale: The closest remaining apple is at (0,8). Moving LEFT to (0,3) starts the path upward along the left edge, avoiding self-collision and safely navigating toward the apple.  \nStrategy: Next moves should continue UP along the left column to reach (0,8) while monitoring for new apple spawns or enemy movements.  \nDirection: LEFT"

Moving up continues the path toward the apple at (0,8).\n- **DOWN** to (0,2): This would be moving back towards my previous position (1,3) which is now part of my body. Wait, my body is at [(1,3)], so (0,2) is empty. Wait, no. My head is at (0,3), and my body is at [(1,3)]. So moving DOWN to (0,2) is safe as it's a new cell.

The apples are at (1,3), (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7). The enemy snake is at (6,5) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I should check the positions of the apples relative to my current position. The closest apple is at (1,3), which is directly above me. If I move UP from (1,2) to (1,3), I can eat that apple and grow. That seems like a good immediate target. But I need to make sure that moving there is safe. Since my body is empty, moving into that spot won't hit myself. Also, the enemy snake is at (6,5), which is far away, so no collision risk there. So moving UP to get the apple at (1,3) seems safe and beneficial.\n\nOther apples are further away. The ones at (9,2) and (9,0) are on the right edge. Moving right towards them would take several moves, and I might have to compete with the enemy snake. But since the enemy is at (6,5), maybe they're heading towards other apples. But for the first move, getting the closest apple makes sense.\n\nWait, what about possible future moves? If I go UP to (1,3), then next turn I can look for the next apple. Let's see, after eating (1,3), my body would have a segment. Then I need to plan the next move. But for now, the immediate move is to get the apple. Also, moving UP is safe because there's no obstacle in that direction. The board shows that (1,3) is an apple, so moving there is good.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (2,2) would take me towards the center, but there's no apple there. Moving LEFT would take me to (0,2), which is safe but no apple. Moving DOWN to (1,1) is also safe but no apple. So the best option is UP to get the apple and start growing.\n\nI should also consider the enemy's position. Snake #1 is at (6,5). They might be heading towards the apples at (9,7) or (8,7), but that's on the top right. Since I'm on the left side, maybe I can focus on the apples on the left first. The apple at (1,3) is the closest, so that's the priority.\n\nSo the plan is: move UP to (1,3) to eat the apple, gain a point, and then plan the next move from there. Next turn, I can check the new positions and decide again. But for now, UP is the best move.\n</think>\n\nUP  \nRationale: The closest apple is at (1,3) directly above.

The apples now are at (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). Wait, the initial list had (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). But after eating the one at (1,3), that apple is gone. So the remaining apples are those five minus (1,3)? Wait, no, the initial apples were (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). The apple at (1,3) was part of the board state, but maybe the list in the problem was different. Wait, looking back:\n\nThe user message says \"Apples at: (9, 2), (9, 7), (9, 0), (8, 7), (0, 8)\". But in the board state, there's an A at (1,3) (since the snake was at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)]). Wait, maybe the initial setup had the snake at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)] because it just moved up. So the apple at (1,3) was eaten in the last move. So the remaining apples are the ones listed: (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). So those are the current apples.\n\nSo now, my snake is at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]. The next move is to decide where to go. The available directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. Let's check each direction.\n\nUP from (1,3) would take me to (1,4). Is that safe? The board shows that (1,4) is empty. No snake or apple there. Moving there would not hit anything. But there's no apple, so I won't grow. But moving up would keep me safe and explore towards the top.\n\nDOWN would take me to (1,2), which is my own body. That's a collision, so I can't go DOWN.\n\nLEFT to (0,3). Is that safe? The board shows (0,3) is empty. No snakes there. So moving left is possible. But again, no apple there. The apple at (0,8) is far up. So moving left would be safe but not towards an apple.\n\nRIGHT to (2,3). That's also empty. No immediate threat. But again, no apple there. The closest apples are at (9,2), (8,7), etc. So moving right might be a way to head towards those, but it's a long path.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (9,2) is on the top right, (9,7) and (8,7) are also top right, (9,0) is bottom right, and (0,8) is top left. The apple at (0,8) is at the top left corner. From my current position (1,3), moving up to (1,4), then left to (0,4), then up to (0,5), etc., could eventually reach (0,8). But that's several moves. Alternatively, moving right towards the center might get me closer to other apples.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (0,8) is the closest in terms of vertical distance. From (1,3) to (0,8) is 5 units up and 1 left. But moving up and left would take time. Alternatively, moving up to (1,4), then (1,5), etc., towards (0,8). But that's a long path. Alternatively, maybe the apples on the right are more reachable.\n\nWait, the apple at (9,2) is at the bottom right. From (1,3), moving right across the board to x=9, y=2. That's 8 steps right and 1 down. But that's a long way. The enemy snake is at (6,6), which is in the middle. So moving towards (9,2) might risk crossing paths with the enemy.\n\nThe apple at (8,7) is at the top right. From (1,3), moving right and up. That's 7 steps right and 4 up. Also a long path. The apple at (9,7) is even further.\n\nThe apple at (0,8) is top left. From (1,3), moving left to (0,3) then up to (0,8). That's 5 up. So 5 moves up. But that's a possible path. However, moving up from (1,3) to (1,4), then (1,5), etc., but that's along the same column. But maybe there's a risk of getting trapped if I go too far up without a plan.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should head towards the apple at (0,8). Let's see: from (1,3), moving left to (0,3), then up to (0,4), (0,5), etc., until (0,8). That's 5 moves up. But each move up would require checking for safety. Alternatively, moving up first, then left.\n\nBut the immediate next move: if I go UP to (1,4), that's safe. Then next move, I can go UP again to (1,5), and so on. But there's no apple in that path until (0,8). Alternatively, moving RIGHT towards the center might open up more options.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (6,6) with no body. They might be moving towards apples as well. If they head towards (8,7) or (9,7), that's their path. But I'm on the left side, so maybe focusing on (0,8) is better.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (0,8) is the only one on the left side. So moving towards that makes sense. Let's plan a path.\n\nFrom (1,3):\n\nOption 1: Move LEFT to (0,3), then UP to (0,4), (0,5), etc., until (0,8). That's 5 moves up. But each step, I need to avoid colliding with myself. Since my body is now [(1,3), (1,2)] after moving. Wait, after moving UP to (1,4), the body becomes [(1,4), (1,3), (1,2)]? Wait, no. Wait, the snake's body is [(1,3), (1,2)] because the head is at (1,3) and the body is [(1,2)]. So when I move, the head moves to the new position, and the body follows. So if I move UP to (1,4), the new body becomes [(1,3), (1,2)]. Then next move, if I move UP again to (1,5), the body becomes [(1,4), (1,3)]. So the tail moves forward each step unless I eat an apple.\n\nBut since there's no apple in the immediate path, moving towards (0,8) would require several steps without growing. But the apple at (0,8) is there. So maybe it's worth the journey.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT towards the center to get closer to other apples. For example, moving RIGHT to (2,3), then (3,3), etc., towards (9,2) or (8,7). But that's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, check if there's any other apple closer. The apples are at (9,2), (9,7), (9,0), (8,7), (0,8). The closest in terms of Manhattan distance from (1,3):\n\n- (0,8): |1-0| + |3-8| = 1 +5=6\n- (9,2): 8 +1=9\n- (9,7): 8 +4=12\n- (8,7):7 +4=11\n- (9,0):8 +3=11\n\nSo (0,8) is the closest. So moving towards (0,8) makes sense.\n\nSo the plan is to move LEFT to (0,3), then UP towards (0,8). But first, moving LEFT to (0,3) is safe. Let's check the board state again. The board shows that at column 0, row 8 is an apple (0,8). So moving left to (0,3) is safe. Then from there, moving up each step.\n\nBut wait, moving LEFT from (1,3) to (0,3) is possible. Then next move, UP to (0,4), etc. But each move without an apple won't grow the snake, so the body length remains the same. So the snake's body would be [(0,3), (1,3), (1,2)] after moving left. Wait, no. The snake's body is the previous positions. When the snake moves, the head moves to the new position, and each body segment follows. So if the snake is at (1,3) with body [(1,2)], moving LEFT to (0,3) would make the new body [(1,3)]. So the tail moves forward. So the body length is maintained unless an apple is eaten.\n\nSince there's no apple at (0,3), moving there would not increase the length. So the body becomes [(1,3)], and the head is at (0,3). Then next move, if I go UP to (0,4), the body becomes [(0,3)], and so on. So the snake's length is 2 (head + 1 body segment) because I ate one apple before. Wait, initial state: the snake was at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)], which is length 2. After moving UP to (1,4), the body becomes [(1,3)], so length remains 2. If I eat an apple, the body grows by one. So since I just ate the apple at (1,3), the snake's length is now 2 (head at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]). Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow. So after moving to (1,3) (the apple), the snake's body becomes [(1,3), (1,2)], making the length 3. Wait, the initial body was [(1,2)] when the head was at (1,3). So after eating the apple, the body grows by one. So the next move, when you move, the tail doesn't move. So the body becomes [(1,3), (1,2)] when you move to a new position. Wait, maybe I need to clarify the growth mechanics.\n\nWhen the snake moves into an apple, it grows by one segment. So the next move, when you move, the tail doesn't advance. So after eating an apple, the snake's length increases by one. So in the previous move, the snake was at (1,2) with body [(1,2)] (head) and [(1,1)]? Wait, no. The initial state after the last move: the snake was at (1,3) with body at [(1,2)]. That implies that the snake had just moved UP from (1,2) to (1,3), eating the apple there, so the body becomes [(1,2)] (the previous head position). So the snake's length is 2 (head + 1 body segment). Then, when moving again, if you don't eat an apple, the body moves forward, so the tail moves. So after moving to a new position without eating, the body becomes the previous head position, and the tail is cut.\n\nBut in this current state, after eating the apple at (1,3), the snake's length is now 2 (head at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]). Wait, no. When you eat an apple, you grow by one. So if the snake was length 1 (head only), after eating, it becomes length 2 (head and one body segment). If it was length 2, after eating, it becomes length 3. So in the previous move, the snake was at (1,2) with body [(1,1)] (length 2). Then moved UP to (1,3), ate the apple, so the body becomes [(1,2), (1,1)] (length 3). But according to the user's current state, the snake is at (1,3) with body [(1,2)]. That suggests that the snake's length is 2. So maybe the initial state after the last move was that the snake was at (1,3) with body [(1,2)], implying that it just ate an apple, so the body grew by one. So the length is now 2 (head + 1 body). So when moving next, if you don't eat an apple, the body moves, so the tail (the last segment) is removed. Wait, no. The snake's movement works such that each time it moves, the head moves to a new position, and each body segment follows the previous one. If it eats an apple, the tail doesn't move, so the body grows by one. If it doesn't eat an apple, the tail moves forward, so the body length remains the same.\n\nSo in the current state, after eating the apple, the snake's body is [(1,2)] (so total length 2). When moving next, if it doesn't eat an apple, the body will become the previous head position, and the tail (1,2) is removed. So the new body would be [(1,3)], and the head moves to the new position. So the length remains 2.\n\nBut this is getting a bit confusing. Let's focus on the current position and possible moves.\n\nCurrent position: head at (1,3), body at [(1,2)]. So the snake's length is 2. The next move can be UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nPossible moves:\n\nUP: (1,4). Check if that's safe. The board shows that (1,4) is empty. No snakes or apples there. So moving UP is safe. No apple, so the snake's body becomes [(1,3)], and the head moves to (1,4). Length remains 2.\n\nDOWN: (1,2). That's the body segment. Collision, so can't move DOWN.\n\nLEFT: (0,3). Check if that's safe. The board shows (0,3) is empty. So moving LEFT is safe. No apple there, so body becomes [(1,3)], head at (0,3). Length remains 2.\n\nRIGHT: (2,3). Safe, no apple. Body becomes [(1,3)], head at (2,3). Length remains 2.\n\nSo all possible moves except DOWN are safe. Now, which direction leads towards the nearest apple?\n\nThe nearest apple is (0,8) at Manhattan distance 6. To reach (0,8), moving LEFT to (0,3) then UP through (0,4) to (0,8) would take 5 moves up. Each move up without apples would keep the snake at length 2. But when reaching (0,8), eating the apple would increase the length to 3.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP from (1,3) to (1,4), then (1,5), etc., towards (0,8) would take longer. But maybe there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT towards the center to get closer to other apples. For example, moving RIGHT to (2,3), then (3,3), etc., towards (9,2) or (8,7). But those are much further.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (6,6) with no body. They might be moving towards the apples on the right side. So maybe the apples on the right are more contested. The apple at (0,8) is on the left, so maybe it's safer to go for that.\n\nSo the best move is to go LEFT to (0,3) to start heading towards (0,8). That way, I can move up along the left edge to reach the apple. Moving LEFT now is safe and starts the journey towards the closest apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving UP to (1,4) keeps me in the same column, but there's no apple there. But maybe there's a path to another apple. However, the closest apple is (0,8), so moving LEFT seems better.\n\nAnother thing to consider: after moving LEFT to (0,3), the next move would be UP to (0,4), then (0,5), etc. Each of those positions is safe as long as there's no obstacle. Since the enemy is at (6,6), they are far away. So the path seems safe.\n\nTherefore, the best move is LEFT to (0,3) to start moving towards the apple at (0,8).\n</think>\n\nLEFT  \nRationale: The closest remaining apple is at (0,8). Moving LEFT to (0,3) starts the path upward along the left edge, avoiding self-collision and safely navigating toward the apple.  \nStrategy: Next moves should continue UP along the left column to reach (0,8) while monitoring for new apple spawns or enemy movements.  \nDirection: LEFT"
