This might allow further right movement toward potential future directions where the apples are located. \n\n### Focus on Apples:\nTo get to the apples effectively, I see that going **RIGHT to (4, 3)** keeps me aligned horizontally in row 3 with more options to move towards the apples that are located in row 5. Additionally, this helps avoid running into the enemy snake on the following turns.\n\n### Enemy Snake Considerations:\nThere is no immediate danger from the enemy since they are currently far away at (7, 2) and the snake's body part at (7, 2) is not directly obstructing my moves.\n\n### Conclusion:\nIn summary, moving to the right seems like the best option as it maintains flexibility in approaching the apples while keeping me safe from the enemy snake for now.\n\n**Next Move Decision**: RIGHT to (4, 3) \n\nSo my decided next move is: RIGHT."
