I also don't want to go backwards, so I'll try to move up towards the apple.\n\nStrategy: I'll try to move up towards the apple at (0, 4) and see if I can get to it safely.\n\nNext move: UP"

If we move UP to (2,2), we immediately align our y coordinate with apple (6,2) (since 2 is the apple\u2019s y value) and we can then make our way right, step\u2010by\u2010step, toward it. (The apple at (0,4) is equally distant but on the left, where the enemy\u2019s snake at (1,9) is lurking near; hence, it seems safer to head toward the apple on the right.) None of our immediate moves put us at risk of hitting a wall or an enemy.\n\nTherefore, the best step is to move UP.\n\nNext move: UP."
