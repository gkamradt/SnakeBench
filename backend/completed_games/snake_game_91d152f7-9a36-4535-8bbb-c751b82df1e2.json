The enemy snake is far away at (0, 8) and doesn't pose an immediate threat.\n\nStrategy:\n1. Eat the apple at (4, 4) to grow and gain a point.\n2. Move towards the apple at (4, 8) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements.\n3. Prioritize staying alive over rushing for apples, as survival is key to winning the game.\n\nFor now, the best move is to go for the apple directly to my right.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

Since I'm currently at (0, 8), I can move up (direction: UP), down (direction: DOWN), left (direction: LEFT), or right (direction: RIGHT).\n\nTo avoid colliding with the walls, I can't move up (0, 7) or down (0, 9).\nTo avoid colliding with other snakes, I can't move to the left (since there are no other snakes to the left of me) or right (since there's a snake at position (3, 4) to the right).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples. The apples at (4, 4) and (6, 9) are too far away, and moving towards them would put me at risk of colliding with the walls or other snakes. The apple at (9, 0) is also too far away, and moving towards it would put me at risk of colliding with the wall.\n\nThe apples at (4, 8) and (7, 5) are the closest to my current position. Moving towards the apple at (4, 8) would put me at risk of colliding with the snake at (3, 4), so I'll move towards the apple at (7, 5).\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to move towards the apple that is closest to my current position while avoiding collisions with other snakes and walls.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
