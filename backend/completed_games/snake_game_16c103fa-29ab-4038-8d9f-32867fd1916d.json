Since my last move was LEFT and I'm now at (5, 5), I should continue moving left to get closer to the apple.\n\nHowever, I should also consider the position of the enemy snake. If I move left, I'll be at (4, 5) and the enemy snake will still be above me. If the enemy snake moves down, I'll be in a vulnerable position.\n\nBut since the enemy snake is currently at (5, 6) and not directly above my desired path, I think it's safe to move left for now. Once I'm at (4, 5), I can reassess the situation and decide whether to move up or not.\n\nStrategy for next turn: If the enemy snake moves down, consider moving down to avoid it. If the enemy snake stays in its current position or moves up, I can move up towards the apple.\n\nNext move: LEFT."
