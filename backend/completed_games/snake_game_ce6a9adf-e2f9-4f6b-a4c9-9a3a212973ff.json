The enemy snake #2 is currently at (0, 7) and moving away from our snake, so it does not pose an immediate threat.\n\nTo reach the apple at (1, 5), the snake must move up two spaces from its current position.

Therefore, to move up, the snake must first turn around, which can be done by moving right once, and then continue moving up to collect the apple.\n\nThe strategy for the next turn after collecting the apple at (1, 5) will be to move left to position the snake for the next apple while keeping an escape route open. This will also ensure that the snake does not get trapped against the left wall.\n\nHere's the plan:\n1. Move right once to turn the snake around (since the snake is currently facing left).\n2. Move up twice to reach and collect the apple at (1, 5).\n3. After collecting the apple, move left to position the snake for future apple collection while maintaining a safe distance from the walls and the enemy snake.\n\nBased on this plan, the next move is: RIGHT (to turn the snake around).\n\nNext turn strategy: After moving right this turn, I will move up twice on the subsequent turn to collect the apple at (1, 5).
