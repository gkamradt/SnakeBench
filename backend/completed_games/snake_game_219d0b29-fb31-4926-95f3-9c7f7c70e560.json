My main goals are to eat the apples to grow and to not crash into any walls, myself, or any enemy snakes. \n\n**Current Situation:**\n1. I'm at (2, 2) with apples at (4, 5), (3, 3), (8, 4), (6, 3), and (2, 6).\n2. Enemy Snake #2 is at (5, 0) and isn't close enough to be of immediate concern given that I\u2019m focusing on nearby targets.\n\n**Apples Analysis:**\n- The nearest apple is at (3, 3), just one step up and one step to the right away.\n- Another relatively close apple is at (2, 6), but it's further away compared to (3, 3).\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\n- Moving towards the apple at (3, 3) seems like a logical choice as it is the closest one, enabling me to grow and score a point.\n- This route allows me some flexibility to later pursue apples at (2, 6) or (4, 5).\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- I must avoid moving into walls or doubling back on myself. Currently, the path to (3, 3) stays clear of these dangers since there are no obstructions between (2, 2) and (3, 3).\n\nGiven this analysis, the next best move is to take a step towards (3, 3).\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**"

My main goals are to eat the apples to grow and to not crash into any walls, myself, or any enemy snakes. \n\n**Current Situation:**\n1. I'm at (2, 2) with apples at (4, 5), (3, 3), (8, 4), (6, 3), and (2, 6).\n2. Enemy Snake #2 is at (5, 0) and isn't close enough to be of immediate concern given that I\u2019m focusing on nearby targets.\n\n**Apples Analysis:**\n- The nearest apple is at (3, 3), just one step up and one step to the right away.\n- Another relatively close apple is at (2, 6), but it's further away compared to (3, 3).\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\n- Moving towards the apple at (3, 3) seems like a logical choice as it is the closest one, enabling me to grow and score a point.\n- This route allows me some flexibility to later pursue apples at (2, 6) or (4, 5).\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- I must avoid moving into walls or doubling back on myself. Currently, the path to (3, 3) stays clear of these dangers since there are no obstructions between (2, 2) and (3, 3).\n\nGiven this analysis, the next best move is to take a step towards (3, 3).\n\n**Next Move: RIGHT**"
