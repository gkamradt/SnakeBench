(7, 6)\n  2. (2, 9)\n  3. (3, 3)\n  4. (0, 7)\n\n- **Enemy Snake Position**: \n  - Snake #2 at (8, 1) with a body segment at (8, 2)\n\n### Possible Moves from (5, 1):\n1. **UP (to (5, 2))** - Valid move to an empty space. No apple there.\n2. **DOWN (to (5, 0))** - Valid move to an empty space. No apple there.\n3. **LEFT (to (4, 1))** - Backwards move. Not allowed.\n4. **RIGHT (to (6, 1))** - Valid move to an empty space. No apple there.\n\n### Analyzing Moves:\n- Moving UP or DOWN again doesn't provide any immediate benefits since there are no nearby apples, and both moves just lead to empty spaces.\n- The RIGHT move goes to (6, 1), which might open up additional options in future moves, though still no apples are there.\n\n### Future Considerations:\n- The goal is still to head towards areas with more apples. \n- The apple at (3, 3) could be a future target, so moving UP later could open a pathway.\n- However, moving towards (7, 6) after this could become useful once I'm ready to shift my strategy towards getting that apple.\n\nIn this case, to keep options open and progress further, I'll utilize the opportunity to continue moving RIGHT (to (6, 1)) as it keeps me in a safe space while potentially leading to later moves that bring me closer to apples.\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT.**"

It\u2019s trailing behind me but is not an immediate threat.\n   - There's plenty of open space on the board, but I should be mindful of the enemy snake's potential movements.\n\n4. **Strategic Approach:**\n   - The apple at (3, 3) is fairly isolated and may present a safe target without much competition.\n   - The apple at (7, 6) is closer but would require moving strategically to avoid being predictable to enemy Snake #1.\n\n5. **Immediate Considerations:**\n   - Moving UP to (8, 2) positions me closer to the apples on the board and keeps distance from the enemy snake.\n   - I should stay near the edges of the enemy snake's current region of influence to avoid collision.\n\n**Conclusion for Current Move:**\n- I'll move UP from (8, 1) to (8, 2), setting myself up for potentially targeting the apple at (7, 6) or re-evaluating based on enemy movements.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n- After moving up, I'll analyze the board for the enemy snake's movements and decide whether to pursue a nearby apple or take evasive action.\n\nMy decided next move is: **UP**."
