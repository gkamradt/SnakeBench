This also preserves my ability to safely avoid the enemy snake.\n\n### Potential Moves:\n1. **UP to (4, 9)** - This is out of bounds since the y-coordinate exceeds 9, which results in a fatal move.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 7)** - This is a valid space; I can then move further down.\n3. **LEFT to (3, 8)** - This is a valid space, but it doesn't help me reach any apples immediately.\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 8)** - This is also a valid space away from apples and towards the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that moving down (4, 7) is the only route that leads me to the apple at (4, 4) while keeping me safely away from the enemy, this should be my next move.\n\n### Next Move Decision:\nThe best move, considering the board state, is DOWN to (4, 7). Afterward, I can continue to move down to (4, 6) and then (4, 5), ultimately reaching the apple at (4, 4).\n\nSo my decided next move is: **DOWN**."

The enemy snake (#2) is located at **(4, 4)**, but its body at (5, 4) is a path to avoid for now.\n\n### Evaluating Moves:\n- **UP (4, 7)**: Invalid, as it is out of bounds.\n- **DOWN (4, 5)**: Valid, moves me closer to (4, 4), but does not capture an apple.\n- **LEFT (3, 6)**: Valid, but moves further from all apple locations.\n- **RIGHT (5, 6)**: Valid but moves towards the enemy snake.\n\nIf I move **DOWN (4, 5)**, I will be one step closer to (4, 4), which is an apple. Depending on the enemy's moves, this could be strategic because I have a guaranteed apple on my next move if I get to (4, 4).\n\n### Strategy:\nI need to maximize my potential to collect apples while avoiding getting too close to the enemy snake. \n\n1. Prioritize moving towards apples.\n2. Avoid risky moves toward the enemy's location unless forced.\n3. If an apple is reachable, prioritize that route to gain points.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, moving **DOWN (to (4, 5))** is the best option. It maintains proximity to an apple while minimizing risks associated with enemy movement.\n\nThus, my decided next move is: **DOWN**."
