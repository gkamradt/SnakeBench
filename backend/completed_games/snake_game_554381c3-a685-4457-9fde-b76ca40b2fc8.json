I should therefore move in their direction.\n\nMy current position is also safe as it is distant from the board edges, minimizing my chances of accidentally crashing and ending the game prematurely. This creates a risk versus reward scenario where I'm tempted to move left towards the apples, but should be careful not to end up cornered on the left side of the board.\n\nHence, I should remember next turn to move with caution towards the apples, possibly pathing upwards and downwards to avoid ending up stuck to the board's edges.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
