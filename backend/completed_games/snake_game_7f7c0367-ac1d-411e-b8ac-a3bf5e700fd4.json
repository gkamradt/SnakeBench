This move positions the snake closer to the apples at (8, 2) and (8, 1), which are relatively accessible and can be targeted in subsequent moves. Additionally, it maintains a safe distance from the enemy snake and keeps the snake well-positioned for flexible maneuvering across the board.\n\n**Next Move:** **DOWN**"

This move positions the snake closer to the apples at (8, 2) and (8, 1), allowing for quicker collection of points. Additionally, it maintains a safe distance from the enemy snake and keeps the snake well-positioned for flexible maneuvering across the board.\n\n**Next Move:** **RIGHT**"
