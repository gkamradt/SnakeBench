T 1 . .\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n 6 . A . . . . . . . .\n 5 . . . . . . . . . .\n 4 . . . . . . . . . .\n 3 . . . . . . . . . .\n 2 . A . . . . . . . .\n 1 . . A . A . . . . .\n 0 . . . . . A . . . .\n   0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n```\n\n**Options for the next move:**\n1. **UP**: Move to (7, 9) \u2013 Puts me nearer the enemies' proximity but doesn't approach any apples immediately.\n2. **DOWN**: Move to (7, 7) \u2013 Clear space, moving away from the active enemy.\n3. **LEFT**: Move to (6, 8) \u2013 Moves away from the enemy and doesn\u2019t approach any apples.\n4. **RIGHT**: Move to (8, 8) \u2013 Gets closer to the enemy snake (#2).\n\nConsidering the current options, moving **DOWN** is optimal. It allows me to maintain flexibility between several apples to the south and keep a good distance from Snake #2, who is currently inactive but resides near the right boundary of the board.\n\n**Proposed Strategy for Future Turns:**\n- After moving down, I should evaluate the position again to decide whether to head for the apple at (1, 6). This might require gradually moving towards the bottom left of the board.\n  \n**Decided Move:**\nI will move **DOWN** to (7, 7)."
