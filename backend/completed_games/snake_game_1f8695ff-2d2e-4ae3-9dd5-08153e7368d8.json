If Enemy Snake #1 has moved in a way that affects our decision, we'll adapt in the next turn based on new information.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn (if successful with the chosen move)**:\n- After consuming the apple at (4, 0), reassess the board for Enemy Snake #1's position and the distribution of remaining apples. Consider moving UP to position ourselves for a potential grab at one of the higher apples, depending on the risk level posed by Enemy Snake #1's new position.\n\n**Decided Next Move**: \nGiven the direct reward and relatively low perceived risk, moving RIGHT to consume the apple at (4, 0) is the chosen action.\n\n**NEXT MOVE: RIGHT**"
