This makes it quite a distance away from me and is not an immediate threat to my well-being. \n\nLooking at the board, once I've eaten the apple at (0,7), the next closest apple will be at (1,4) which would require me to move RIGHT and then UP.

This makes it quite a distance away from me and is not an immediate threat to my well-being. \n\nLooking at the board, once I've eaten the apple at (0,7), the next closest apple will be at (1,4) which would require me to move RIGHT and then UP.

This makes it quite a distance away from me and is not an immediate threat to my well-being. \n\nLooking at the board, once I've eaten the apple at (0,7), the next closest apple will be at (1,4) which would require me to move RIGHT and then UP.

Moving RIGHT to (1, 4) would bring me directly to that apple.\n\nHowever, I also need to consider the position of the enemy snake. Moving RIGHT would put me in a vulnerable position if the enemy snake decides to move left towards me.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to prioritize scoring points by eating the apple at (1, 4), but also to be cautious of the enemy snake's position and movements. I'll need to be prepared to quickly change direction if the enemy snake starts moving closer.\n\nNext turn, I'll continue to focus on scoring points by eating apples, while also positioning myself to avoid collisions with the enemy snake or the walls.\n\nMy next move: RIGHT."

This move is also based on the same reasons as my previous move, as there are two apples at (5, 7) and (6, 7), which are currently the closest to me. \n\nSnake #2, being at the bottom region of the map, is heading towards the upper region. Although its growth could pose a threat eventually, currently, it does not seem to be nearing my position. Therefore, it's unlikely to challenge my snake's position in the upper half of the map. \n\nGoing UP is not a choice as it would lead to collision with the wall of the board and going DOWN brings me closer to Snake #2's territory. The LEFT direction would lead me away from the apples and closer to the wall and snake #2.\n\nFor the next turn, I would continue to observe Snake #2, predict its moves and adjust my strategy based on that. At this point, the goal remains to capture the apples at (5, 7) and (6, 7) to facilitate growth and gain points.\n\nFinal decision for the next move: RIGHT.\n\n--End of Your Move Information.--"
