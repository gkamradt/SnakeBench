From here, I can analyze my next potential moves:\n\n1. **UP to (2, 5)**: This position is empty. It doesn\u2019t bring me closer to any apples but keeps me safe from the enemy snake.\n2. **DOWN to (2, 3)**: This position is also empty and doesn\u2019t contribute towards my goal of reaching the apples, just like moving up.\n3. **LEFT to (1, 4)**: This is moving back to my previous position. Again, this is undesirable as it doesn\u2019t move me closer to my goal.\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 4)**: This is moving back to my original position, so it\u2019s not a choice either.\n\nNow considering potential apple targets:\n- The apple at (5, 2) will require a right and further downward movement.\n- The apple at (6, 4) is reachable by navigating right and then climbing up, so I still want to maintain that trajectory.\n\n**Evaluation Against Enemy Snake**:\nThe nearest enemy snake is at (6, 8) with its body extending further down the (7, 8) row. I need to ensure I\u2019m not putting myself in a tight position that could potentially lead to a corner.\n\n### Next Move Decision:\nAfter evaluating my options, the best route appears to be **UP to (2, 5)**. This will keep me safe, allow me to reconsider my next steps without immediate danger, and potentially set up subsequent moves towards the apples.\n\n### Strategy Reminder:\nContinue to focus on moving towards the apples while keeping the enemy snake in check. Safe positioning is key to avoiding any traps.\n\n**Decided next move: UP.**"

Continuing with my strategy from the last move, my planned direction is DOWN to head towards the cluster of apples at lower coordinates, and specifically the apple at the position (4, 8). \n\nMoving DOWN will also allow me to avoid any potential collision with the body of my snake as it's located in upper part. Also, this move will take me away from the enemy snake which is currently located at (3, 4) towards the bottom part where the apples are located. \n\nThe next step after this would be to move LEFT and then DOWN again to reach the apple at (4, 8). However, I should remain vigilant of the movements of the enemy snake and adjust my strategy accordingly to avoid any potential collisions or running into a boundary.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN."

Moving towards (4, 5) will not put me closer to a danger zone since it's far from the enemy at (6, 7).\n- **Apple Targeting**: The immediate apple targets still available are (4, 8) and (6, 4), both of which I can navigate towards after moving to (4, 5).\n\n### Next Move Decision:\nBased on proximity to apples and safety from threats, moving **RIGHT to (4, 5)** will allow me to continue navigating toward potential apples in the upcoming turns while avoiding crossing paths with the enemy snake.\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT.**"

However, moving UP from my current position would bring me in close proximity of my own tail and potentially cause a collision. Therefore, going UP may not be the best decision at this point. \n\nOn the other hand, If I move RIGHT, I can distance myself from my own tail and also put more distance between myself and the enemy snake. Then I can move DOWN to (7, 6), and LEFT to (6, 6) on the following turns.\n\nThis would position me closer to the two apples at (5, 2) and (6, 4). The apple at (4, 8) is a bit out of the way, but I can circle back to it later once I've added more length to my snake by consuming the closer apples and have navigated away from my tail.\n\nThis approach also keeps me generally in the center of the board, giving me more room to maneuver and reducing the chance of hitting a wall.\n\n--End of thinking out loud--\n\nStrategy for next turn: Move RIGHT now to avoid my tail and get closer to the apples at (5, 2) and (6, 4). Then I'll move DOWN and LEFT in the following turns to actually reach those apples. After that, I'll reassess the situation, possibly circling back to the apple at (4, 8) or aiming for one of the apples clustered at the bottom of the board depending on the enemy snake's position.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT."
