Moving LEFT would hit the wall immediately, so that leaves us with moving RIGHT.\n\n5. **Next Move Decision:**\n   - Moving RIGHT allows us some flexibility to proceed towards apples at (5, 7) or (4, 4) down the line.\n   - There is no immediate threat from Snake #2 on this path.\n  \n**Decided Move:** RIGHT\n\nThis move opens up the board, gives us more space to maneuver, and starts a journey towards other apples.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\n\n- Evaluate the most accessible apple after moving to (1, 9).\n- Be cautious of barriers as we move along the top edge, transitioning eventually down to where the apples are.\n- Remain aware of Snake #2's movements but continue focusing on our path to the next apple."
