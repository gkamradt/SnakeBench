Staying along the right edge also limits the areas where the enemy snake can encroach, maintaining a relatively safer corridor for movement.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:** After moving UP to (9, 8), prioritize moving **UP** again to (9, 9) to collect the apple. Upon consuming the apple, evaluate the surrounding area to ensure there are clear paths for continued movement, avoiding potential traps near the walls or enemy snake positions. Maintain awareness of the enemy snake's movements to anticipate and react to any aggressive maneuvers that could threaten the snake's safety.\n\n**Decided next move:** UP"

Maintaining a balance between collecting available apples and avoiding enemy proximity will be crucial. Additionally, staying aware of the enemy snake's possible paths will help in making informed decisions to maximize point accumulation while ensuring survival.\n\n**Decided next move:** UP"

Collecting the apple provides an immediate point and growth opportunity, which can be strategically leveraged in subsequent moves to navigate the board effectively. To mitigate the risks associated with being near the enemy, the snake should plan subsequent moves to ensure ample space for maneuvering and avoid getting trapped.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:** Upon moving UP to (9, 9) and consuming the apple, the snake should prioritize moving **LEFT** to (8, 9) or **DOWN** to (9, 8), depending on the enemy's movements. Maintaining a balance between collecting available apples and avoiding enemy proximity will be crucial.

Maintaining a balance between collecting available apples and avoiding enemy proximity will be crucial.

This move positions the snake closer to the high-value apple at (9, 9), enabling the opportunity to collect it in the subsequent move. Although it brings the snake nearer to the enemy snake's territory, careful navigation can mitigate collision risks. Staying along the right edge also limits the areas where the enemy snake can encroach, maintaining a relatively safer corridor for movement.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:** After moving UP to (9, 8), prioritize moving **UP** again to (9, 9) to collect the apple. Upon consuming the apple, evaluate the surrounding area to ensure there are clear paths for continued movement, avoiding potential traps near the walls or enemy snake positions. Maintain awareness of the enemy snake's movements to anticipate and react to any aggressive maneuvers that could threaten the snake's safety.\n\n**Decided next move:** UP"

Maintaining a balance between collecting available apples and avoiding enemy proximity will be crucial. Additionally, staying aware of the enemy snake's possible paths will help in making informed decisions to maximize point accumulation while ensuring survival.\n\n**Decided next move:** UP"
