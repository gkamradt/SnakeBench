I am at the left edge of the board (x = 0). Moving LEFT would result in hitting the wall and dying.\n2. The closest apples to me are at (6, 5) and (2, 0).

Moving UP or DOWN is safe, but I need to decide which direction helps me get closer to an apple.\n\n### Strategy:\n- Prioritize moving toward the closest apple to minimize travel distance and avoid the enemy snake.\n- Avoid moving LEFT since that would result in a wall collision.\n- Plan a path that keeps me away from the enemy snake while heading toward an apple.\n\n### Plan:\n1.
