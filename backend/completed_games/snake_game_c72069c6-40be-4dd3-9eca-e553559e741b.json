This move will strategically position me closer to another apple without immediate risks, and is optimized for gaining points while keeping safe from collision."

This position being at the top edge means I need to be careful not to hit the wall or move over enemy Snake #1 that's last known in this horizontal lane.\n- The closest and safest next targets for apples appear to be (5, 5) and (6, 4) which are towards the center and right side of the board. It's preferable to move towards areas with more space and apple opportunities.\n- Snake #1's last position was ahead at (6, 8) making it hazardous to directly approach the top row horizontally from my current location.\n\nStrategy for This Move:\n- I should avoid borders and potentially dangerous corners and move DOWN to lower y-coordinates. This will place me back towards the middle of the board which is safer and opens up routes to other apples.\n- After moving DOWN, I need to vigilantly watch the movements of Snake #1 and possibly reconsider moving RIGHT in future turns to navigate towards the central and lower-right apples on the board.\n\nNext Turn Attention:\n- On the next move, I should be at (2, 8). Keeping track of Snake #1's movements is crucial to avoid unexpected encounters.\n- From this position, considering a RIGHT movement to position myself better for pursuing the middle board apples might be advisable, depending on enemy locations and apple availability updates.\n\nDecided Next Move: DOWN."
