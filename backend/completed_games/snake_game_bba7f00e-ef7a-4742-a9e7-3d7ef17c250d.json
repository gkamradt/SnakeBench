In such a scenario, moving left towards the enemy snake might put me at risk.\n\nLooking at the current positions, another strategy could be to immediately start moving up after eating the apple at (7,2) to avoid possible collisions and hope for a new apple to appear on the top half of the board closer to my position.\n\nAlthough I am going to eat an apple in this coming turn, I should not be overly confident.

However, doing so will require carefully maneuvering around the other snake. It appears that going UP and then LEFT will still keep me on track to obtaining that apple.\n\nI should continue to monitor the movement of the opposing snake. I need to make sure we don't collide while each moving towards our chosen target apple. His position is currently at (5,3), which places him relatively nearby.\n\nThe two apples at (1,1) and (0,1) still remain on the board. However, as the situation stands, going after these apples doesn't seem to be the best option. I would have to traverse through the playing area and risk potential collisions with the enemy snake or myself.\n\nMy preferred strategy is the one with the least risk and highest reward, which is to aim for the apple located at (7,2). Depending on how the enemy snake moves, I need to be flexible and possibly change my route to increase the chance of obtaining the apple without incurring any risks.\n\nMy decided move for the next turn: UP."
