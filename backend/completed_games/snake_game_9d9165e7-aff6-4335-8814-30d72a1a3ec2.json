            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (7,4), which is on the x=7 line, y=4. The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, I'm somewhere in the middle right area of the board.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are several: at (0,5), (9,5), (4,5), (0,4), and (1,7). So, one is at (0,4) which is right at the bottom left corner, one at (1,7) which is a bit up on the left, and others are spread across the middle and right.\n\nThe enemy snake, Snake #2, is at (4,4) with an empty body, which probably means it's just the head. My snake is at (7,4), so we're both on the same y level, but on different x coordinates.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. The rules say that moving into an apple makes me grow and gain a point. If I hit a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nSo, my first thought is to look for the nearest apple. The apples are at (0,5), (9,5), (4,5), (0,4), and (1,7). My current position is (7,4). Let me calculate the distances.\n\nFrom (7,4) to (0,4): that's a distance of 7 units to the left. To (0,5): diagonal up and left, so longer. To (9,5): that's moving right to x=9, which is 2 units to the right and up 1, but that's quite far. To (4,5): that's left 3 units and up 1. To (1,7): left 6 units and up 3.\n\nBut let's see, the closest apples would be the ones at (4,5) and (1,7). Alternatively, maybe there's an apple at (0,4), but that's 7 units left. However, looking at the board state, I see that at (4,5), there's an apple, and also at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), and (1,7). Wait, but the current position is (7,4), so the apple at (4,5) is 3 units to the left and 1 unit up. Alternatively, the apple at (1,7) is 6 units left and 3 up.\n\nWait, let me visualize the board again. My snake is at (7,4). Let me look at the board rows. Row 4 is where my snake is, at x=7. So, moving up in y is towards higher y values.\n\nLooking for the nearest apple, perhaps the apple at (4,5) is closer. To get there, I need to move left to x=4 and up to y=5. That would require moving left 3 times and then up once, but each move is one step. Alternatively, moving up first to y=5 and then left to x=4. But I need to make sure that I don't run into anything.\n\nWait, but Snake #2 is at (4,4). So, if I move left to (6,4), then to (5,4), (4,4), I would run into Snake #2, which would cause me to die. So, that's a problem. So, moving left directly might not be safe. Alternatively, I could move up first.\n\nFrom (7,4), if I move up to (7,5), that's a safe move because there's nothing there. Then, I can move left to (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), which is an apple. So that seems like a plan. But wait, is (7,5) free? Let me check the apples. Yes, the apples are at (0,5), (4,5), etc. But on the board state, at y=5, x=4 is an apple, so yes, moving to (4,5) is safe, but getting there requires moving through (7,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right to (8,4), (9,4), but I don't see an apple there. The apples are at (9,5), which would require moving up after moving right. But that's two steps away: right to (8,4), then right to (9,4), then up to (9,5). But I don't know if there's a snake or wall in the way, but since it's within the 0-9 range, no walls.\n\nWait, but if I move right to x=8, then x=9, then up to (9,5), that's two moves. But I need to check if there's anything blocking. The only enemy is at (4,4), so that's not in the way. So, that's a possibility.\n\nWait, but the apple at (4,5) is closer in terms of steps. Let me map it out:\n\nOption 1: Move UP to (7,5), then LEFT three times to (4,5).\n\nThat's four moves: up, left, left, left.\n\nBut each turn, I can only move once. So, perhaps in the next move, I should go up.\n\nOption 2: Move RIGHT to (8,4), then to (9,4), then up to (9,5). That's three moves.\n\nBut wait, I have to think about what to do next. But the question is, what's my next move, so I need to decide whether to go up, right, down, or left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left to (6,4) but that's towards the enemy at (4,4), so I can't go that way because I might run into the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (4,4), so if I move left, I go towards x=7-1=6, which is still safe, but moving further left would approach (4,4). So, if I move left now, I would be at (6,4). Then, the next move, I could go left again to (5,4), then perhaps up or something. But I need to avoid (4,4).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving up first is safer because it gets me away from the enemy.\n\nSo, if I move up to (7,5), that's a safe move. Then, next move, I can go left to (6,5), then left again to (5,5), then left to (4,5) where the apple is. That would take three more moves after moving up.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (8,4) now, and then up to (8,5), then to (9,5) for the apple there. But that apple is further away.\n\nSo, which apple is closer? The one at (4,5) is 3 left and 1 up, total of 4 steps. The one at (9,5) is 2 right and 1 up, 3 steps. Wait, actually, from (7,4):\n\nTo (4,5): moving left 3 and up 1, but that's a diagonal, but in terms of steps, you have to move each direction one step at a time. So, from (7,4), moving up to (7,5) then left to (6,5), (5,5), (4,5): total 4 steps.\n\nTo (9,5): moving right to (8,4), then (9,4), then up to (9,5): 3 steps.\n\nHmm, that's closer. But wait, is there any risk in moving right? The enemy is at (4,4), so moving right towards x=8,9 shouldn't be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be safer because it gets me away from the enemy's position. But let me think about what's around.\n\nAfter moving right to (8,4), I'm at (8,4) next. Then, I can go to (9,4) and then up to (9,5) for the apple. But I should check if (9,5) is an apple. Yes, it is. So, that could be a plan.\n\nBut wait, in the board state provided, at row 5, the columns are 0,4,5, etc. So, (9,5) is indeed an apple.\n\nSo, moving to the right towards (9,5) in three steps is possible. Alternatively, moving up to (7,5) and then left to (4,5) would be four steps.\n\nBut which path is safer? Since the enemy is at (4,4), moving towards the right seems to avoid any potential conflicts, as the enemy is on the left side.\n\nAnother consideration is that moving right might put me near the edge of the board at x=9, but that's within bounds, so no problem.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up, I can go towards the apple at (1,7), which is much further away, but perhaps I can get there eventually.\n\nWait, but I don't need to decide the entire path right now; I just need to decide the next move. So, the options are up, down, left, or right.\n\nIf I move up, I go to (7,5), which is safe because there's nothing there except perhaps an apple at (4,5), but I'm not there yet.\n\nIf I move right, I go to (8,4), which is also safe because the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm moving away.\n\nIf I move left, I go to (6,4), which is towards the enemy, but it's still two units away, so that's probably safe now.\n\nIf I move down, I go to (7,3), which is empty as far as I can tell.\n\nSo, which direction is better?\n\nI think moving right to (8,4) makes sense because it gets me closer to the apple at (9,5). Alternatively, moving up to (7,5) starts me on the path to (4,5).\n\nBut I also have to think about the enemy. If the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm at (7,4), if I move left, I'm getting closer to the enemy, but moving right or up moves me away. So, to avoid potential conflict, moving away from the enemy might be safer.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (8,4) seems like a good option. Then, in the next moves, I can move right again to (9,4) and then up to (9,5) to eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving up might be better because it gets me closer to the apple at (4,5), but I have to make sure that path is clear.\n\nWait, perhaps moving left to (6,4) is also an option, but that's towards the enemy. But since the enemy is at (4,4), moving left to (6,4), then (5,4), then I can decide to go up to avoid the enemy.\n\nBut that might be more complicated. I think moving right to (8,4) is safer because I'm not approaching the enemy.\n\nSo, I think I'll choose to move right next.\n</think>\n\nTo get closer to the apple at (9,5) and avoid potential conflict with the enemy at (4,4), I'll move right to (8,4).\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

Then, in the next moves, I can move right again to (9,4) and then up to (9,5) to eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving up might be better because it gets me closer to the apple at (4,5), but I have to make sure that path is clear.\n\nWait, perhaps moving left to (6,4) is also an option, but that's towards the enemy. But since the enemy is at (4,4), moving left to (6,4), then (5,4), then I can decide to go up to avoid the enemy.\n\nBut that might be more complicated. I think moving right to (8,4) is safer because I'm not approaching the enemy.\n\nSo, I think I'll choose to move right next.\n</think>\n\nTo get closer to the apple at (9,5) and avoid potential conflict with the enemy at (4,4), I'll move right to (8,4).\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (7,4), which is on the x=7 line, y=4. The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, I'm somewhere in the middle right area of the board.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are several: at (0,5), (9,5), (4,5), (0,4), and (1,7). So, one is at (0,4) which is right at the bottom left corner, one at (1,7) which is a bit up on the left, and others are spread across the middle and right.\n\nThe enemy snake, Snake #2, is at (4,4) with an empty body, which probably means it's just the head. My snake is at (7,4), so we're both on the same y level, but on different x coordinates.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. The rules say that moving into an apple makes me grow and gain a point. If I hit a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nSo, my first thought is to look for the nearest apple. The apples are at (0,5), (9,5), (4,5), (0,4), and (1,7). My current position is (7,4). Let me calculate the distances.\n\nFrom (7,4) to (0,4): that's a distance of 7 units to the left. To (0,5): diagonal up and left, so longer. To (9,5): that's moving right to x=9, which is 2 units to the right and up 1, but that's quite far. To (4,5): that's left 3 units and up 1. To (1,7): left 6 units and up 3.\n\nBut let's see, the closest apples would be the ones at (4,5) and (1,7). Alternatively, maybe there's an apple at (0,4), but that's 7 units left. However, looking at the board state, I see that at (4,5), there's an apple, and also at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), and (1,7). Wait, but the current position is (7,4), so the apple at (4,5) is 3 units to the left and 1 unit up. Alternatively, the apple at (1,7) is 6 units left and 3 up.\n\nWait, let me visualize the board again. My snake is at (7,4). Let me look at the board rows. Row 4 is where my snake is, at x=7. So, moving up in y is towards higher y values.\n\nLooking for the nearest apple, perhaps the apple at (4,5) is closer. To get there, I need to move left to x=4 and up to y=5. That would require moving left 3 times and then up once, but each move is one step. Alternatively, moving up first to y=5 and then left to x=4. But I need to make sure that I don't run into anything.\n\nWait, but Snake #2 is at (4,4). So, if I move left to (6,4), then to (5,4), (4,4), I would run into Snake #2, which would cause me to die. So, that's a problem. So, moving left directly might not be safe. Alternatively, I could move up first.\n\nFrom (7,4), if I move up to (7,5), that's a safe move because there's nothing there. Then, I can move left to (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), which is an apple. So that seems like a plan. But wait, is (7,5) free? Let me check the apples. Yes, the apples are at (0,5), (4,5), etc. But on the board state, at y=5, x=4 is an apple, so yes, moving to (4,5) is safe, but getting there requires moving through (7,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right to (8,4), (9,4), but I don't see an apple there. The apples are at (9,5), which would require moving up after moving right. But that's two steps away: right to (8,4), then right to (9,4), then up to (9,5). But I don't know if there's a snake or wall in the way, but since it's within the 0-9 range, no walls.\n\nWait, but if I move right to x=8, then x=9, then up to (9,5), that's two moves. But I need to check if there's anything blocking. The only enemy is at (4,4), so that's not in the way. So, that's a possibility.\n\nWait, but the apple at (4,5) is closer in terms of steps. Let me map it out:\n\nOption 1: Move UP to (7,5), then LEFT three times to (4,5).\n\nThat's four moves: up, left, left, left.\n\nBut each turn, I can only move once. So, perhaps in the next move, I should go up.\n\nOption 2: Move RIGHT to (8,4), then to (9,4), then up to (9,5). That's three moves.\n\nBut wait, I have to think about what to do next. But the question is, what's my next move, so I need to decide whether to go up, right, down, or left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left to (6,4) but that's towards the enemy at (4,4), so I can't go that way because I might run into the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (4,4), so if I move left, I go towards x=7-1=6, which is still safe, but moving further left would approach (4,4). So, if I move left now, I would be at (6,4). Then, the next move, I could go left again to (5,4), then perhaps up or something. But I need to avoid (4,4).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving up first is safer because it gets me away from the enemy.\n\nSo, if I move up to (7,5), that's a safe move. Then, next move, I can go left to (6,5), then left again to (5,5), then left to (4,5) where the apple is. That would take three more moves after moving up.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (8,4) now, and then up to (8,5), then to (9,5) for the apple there. But that apple is further away.\n\nSo, which apple is closer? The one at (4,5) is 3 left and 1 up, total of 4 steps. The one at (9,5) is 2 right and 1 up, 3 steps. Wait, actually, from (7,4):\n\nTo (4,5): moving left 3 and up 1, but that's a diagonal, but in terms of steps, you have to move each direction one step at a time. So, from (7,4), moving up to (7,5) then left to (6,5), (5,5), (4,5): total 4 steps.\n\nTo (9,5): moving right to (8,4), then (9,4), then up to (9,5): 3 steps.\n\nHmm, that's closer. But wait, is there any risk in moving right? The enemy is at (4,4), so moving right towards x=8,9 shouldn't be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be safer because it gets me away from the enemy's position. But let me think about what's around.\n\nAfter moving right to (8,4), I'm at (8,4) next. Then, I can go to (9,4) and then up to (9,5) for the apple. But I should check if (9,5) is an apple. Yes, it is. So, that could be a plan.\n\nBut wait, in the board state provided, at row 5, the columns are 0,4,5, etc. So, (9,5) is indeed an apple.\n\nSo, moving to the right towards (9,5) in three steps is possible. Alternatively, moving up to (7,5) and then left to (4,5) would be four steps.\n\nBut which path is safer? Since the enemy is at (4,4), moving towards the right seems to avoid any potential conflicts, as the enemy is on the left side.\n\nAnother consideration is that moving right might put me near the edge of the board at x=9, but that's within bounds, so no problem.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up, I can go towards the apple at (1,7), which is much further away, but perhaps I can get there eventually.\n\nWait, but I don't need to decide the entire path right now; I just need to decide the next move. So, the options are up, down, left, or right.\n\nIf I move up, I go to (7,5), which is safe because there's nothing there except perhaps an apple at (4,5), but I'm not there yet.\n\nIf I move right, I go to (8,4), which is also safe because the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm moving away.\n\nIf I move left, I go to (6,4), which is towards the enemy, but it's still two units away, so that's probably safe now.\n\nIf I move down, I go to (7,3), which is empty as far as I can tell.\n\nSo, which direction is better?\n\nI think moving right to (8,4) makes sense because it gets me closer to the apple at (9,5). Alternatively, moving up to (7,5) starts me on the path to (4,5).\n\nBut I also have to think about the enemy. If the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm at (7,4), if I move left, I'm getting closer to the enemy, but moving right or up moves me away. So, to avoid potential conflict, moving away from the enemy might be safer.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (8,4) seems like a good option. Then, in the next moves, I can move right again to (9,4) and then up to (9,5) to eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving up might be better because it gets me closer to the apple at (4,5), but I have to make sure that path is clear.\n\nWait, perhaps moving left to (6,4) is also an option, but that's towards the enemy. But since the enemy is at (4,4), moving left to (6,4), then (5,4), then I can decide to go up to avoid the enemy.\n\nBut that might be more complicated. I think moving right to (8,4) is safer because I'm not approaching the enemy.\n\nSo, I think I'll choose to move right next.\n</think>\n\nTo get closer to the apple at (9,5) and avoid potential conflict with the enemy at (4,4), I'll move right to (8,4).\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm controlling snake ID 1, which is currently at (9,4). The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, my snake is at the far right side, somewhere in the middle vertically.\n\nApples are located at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), (1,7), and (5,4). My next move was RIGHT, which I decided last turn to move towards the apple at (9,5) and avoid the enemy at (4,4). So I went from (9,4) to (8,4). Wait, no, moving RIGHT would increase the x-coordinate, so from (9,4) moving RIGHT would take me to (10,4), which is outside the board. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake last time. Because moving RIGHT from (9,4) would go to (10,4), which is a wall, so that would cause me to die. Oh no, that's bad. So maybe I should reconsider.\n\nWait, no, in the previous move, I was at (9,4) and the last move was RIGHT, so that would have taken me to (8,4)? No, because moving RIGHT increases x, so from 9 to 10, which is outside. So perhaps I miswrote the last move. Or perhaps the snake can't move right from (9,4) because it's at the edge.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's last move information says they moved RIGHT to (8,4). But wait, from (9,4), moving RIGHT would take you to (10,4), which is a wall. So maybe there's a confusion here. Perhaps they meant to move LEFT to (8,4). Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the coordinates work.\n\nWait, the user's last move was RIGHT, leading to (8,4). So maybe the snake moved from (9,4) to (8,4) by going LEFT? Because moving RIGHT from x=9 would go beyond the board. So perhaps that's a mistake in the last move. Alternatively, maybe the snake can't move RIGHT from (9,4) because it's blocked by the wall, so it somehow stayed put? Or maybe the enemy is blocking.\n\nWait, looking at the board state, in row 4, at (5,4) there's an apple, and at (9,4) is my snake. Enemy snake #2 is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, in row 4, the positions are clear except for the apple at (5,4) and my position at (9,4). So moving LEFT from (9,4) would take me to (8,4), which is empty. So perhaps the last move was LEFT, not RIGHT. So maybe there was a mistake in the previous move.\n\nWait, the last move info says: \"Direction: RIGHT, Rationale: To move towards the apple at (9,5) and avoid the enemy at (4,4), I'll go right to (8,4).\" Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because moving RIGHT from (9,4) would take me to (10,4), which is a wall, causing me to die. So maybe the user made a mistake in the last move. So perhaps the correct move was LEFT to (8,4), because moving RIGHT from (9,4) is invalid.\n\nSo, now, after the last move, I'm at (8,4). What's the current state? Let me check the board again.\n\nThe apples are at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4). My snake is at (8,4). Enemy snake #2 is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, the enemy is in row 5, column 3 and 4. So, enemy is not blocking me in row 4.\n\nLooking at my position, (8,4), I need to decide the next move. The goal is to eat an apple to grow and gain points. So, which apple is closest?\n\nApples at (5,4) is in the same row, 3 units to the left. Apple at (9,5) is one unit up from my current position if I go to (8,5). Wait, (9,5) is at column 9, row 5. So from (8,4), moving up once would take me to (8,5), which is empty. Then moving RIGHT to (9,5) would get me the apple. So that's a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,4) is to the left, but that's 3 moves away. But moving towards (9,5) is closer. Also, since I'm at (8,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,4), which is my previous position, but that's not helpful. Wait, but (9,5) is an apple, so I could go up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) to eat it.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (5,4) is in the same row, so maybe I should go there first. But it's 3 moves to the left. However, moving towards (9,5) is only two moves: up then right.\n\nBut I should also be cautious about the enemy. The enemy snake is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, row 5, columns 3 and 4. So, if I move up to (8,5), I'm at column 8, which is far from the enemy. So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT to (7,4) to head towards (5,4) is better. But let's see which apple is closer.\n\nFrom (8,4):\n\n- To (5,4): distance is 3 (left 3 times).\n- To (9,5): distance is 2 (up once, then right once).\n\nSo, (9,5) is closer. So moving towards (9,5) seems better.\n\nBut wait, if I move up to (8,5), then right to (9,5), I can get the apple. But I need to check if any enemy is in the way. Since the enemy is at (3,5) and (4,5), they're to the left of (8,5), so no collision there.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) would let me eat the apple. Then I grow by one, gain a point, and my snake becomes longer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving to (7,4) first, but that seems less efficient.\n\nWait, is there any other apple closer? No, the other apples are at (0,5), (0,4), and (1,7), which are much farther.\n\nSo, plan is to move UP to (8,5), then RIGHT to (9,5) to get the apple.\n\nWait, but after moving up, I'll be at (8,5). Is that position safe? Let me check the board. At row 5, the enemy is at (3,5) and (4,5), so (8,5) is clear.\n\nSo, moving UP is safe. So next move should be UP.\n\nWait, but another thought: after moving to (8,5), I'm moving towards (9,5), which is an apple. But what if the enemy moves towards that area? But in this turn, it's my move first, so I can take the apple before the enemy does.\n\nAlso, considering that moving to (8,5) doesn't block me from other paths, seems safe.\n\nAnother consideration: if I go up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) to eat the apple, that's two moves. But I can only make one move now, so in this turn, I will move UP to (8,5), and in the next turn, move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nSo, I should decide to move UP now.\n\nWait, but the current position is (8,4). So moving UP would go to (8,5), which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, could I go RIGHT to (9,4), but that's moving back to where I was, which isn't helpful unless I'm trying to get to (9,5) from there. But from (9,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (10,4), which is a wall, so that's not possible. So from (8,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,4), which is okay, but then I'm back where I was, not moving towards the apple. So moving UP seems better.\n\nWait, from (8,4), moving RIGHT goes to (9,4), which is my previous position. But that's possible if I want to turn around.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (7,4), which is on the x=7 line, y=4. The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, I'm somewhere in the middle right area of the board.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are several: at (0,5), (9,5), (4,5), (0,4), and (1,7). So, one is at (0,4) which is right at the bottom left corner, one at (1,7) which is a bit up on the left, and others are spread across the middle and right.\n\nThe enemy snake, Snake #2, is at (4,4) with an empty body, which probably means it's just the head. My snake is at (7,4), so we're both on the same y level, but on different x coordinates.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. The rules say that moving into an apple makes me grow and gain a point. If I hit a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nSo, my first thought is to look for the nearest apple. The apples are at (0,5), (9,5), (4,5), (0,4), and (1,7). My current position is (7,4). Let me calculate the distances.\n\nFrom (7,4) to (0,4): that's a distance of 7 units to the left. To (0,5): diagonal up and left, so longer. To (9,5): that's moving right to x=9, which is 2 units to the right and up 1, but that's quite far. To (4,5): that's left 3 units and up 1. To (1,7): left 6 units and up 3.\n\nBut let's see, the closest apples would be the ones at (4,5) and (1,7). Alternatively, maybe there's an apple at (0,4), but that's 7 units left. However, looking at the board state, I see that at (4,5), there's an apple, and also at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), and (1,7). Wait, but the current position is (7,4), so the apple at (4,5) is 3 units to the left and 1 unit up. Alternatively, the apple at (1,7) is 6 units left and 3 up.\n\nWait, let me visualize the board again. My snake is at (7,4). Let me look at the board rows. Row 4 is where my snake is, at x=7. So, moving up in y is towards higher y values.\n\nLooking for the nearest apple, perhaps the apple at (4,5) is closer. To get there, I need to move left to x=4 and up to y=5. That would require moving left 3 times and then up once, but each move is one step. Alternatively, moving up first to y=5 and then left to x=4. But I need to make sure that I don't run into anything.\n\nWait, but Snake #2 is at (4,4). So, if I move left to (6,4), then to (5,4), (4,4), I would run into Snake #2, which would cause me to die. So, that's a problem. So, moving left directly might not be safe. Alternatively, I could move up first.\n\nFrom (7,4), if I move up to (7,5), that's a safe move because there's nothing there. Then, I can move left to (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), which is an apple. So that seems like a plan. But wait, is (7,5) free? Let me check the apples. Yes, the apples are at (0,5), (4,5), etc. But on the board state, at y=5, x=4 is an apple, so yes, moving to (4,5) is safe, but getting there requires moving through (7,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right to (8,4), (9,4), but I don't see an apple there. The apples are at (9,5), which would require moving up after moving right. But that's two steps away: right to (8,4), then right to (9,4), then up to (9,5). But I don't know if there's a snake or wall in the way, but since it's within the 0-9 range, no walls.\n\nWait, but if I move right to x=8, then x=9, then up to (9,5), that's two moves. But I need to check if there's anything blocking. The only enemy is at (4,4), so that's not in the way. So, that's a possibility.\n\nWait, but the apple at (4,5) is closer in terms of steps. Let me map it out:\n\nOption 1: Move UP to (7,5), then LEFT three times to (4,5).\n\nThat's four moves: up, left, left, left.\n\nBut each turn, I can only move once. So, perhaps in the next move, I should go up.\n\nOption 2: Move RIGHT to (8,4), then to (9,4), then up to (9,5). That's three moves.\n\nBut wait, I have to think about what to do next. But the question is, what's my next move, so I need to decide whether to go up, right, down, or left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left to (6,4) but that's towards the enemy at (4,4), so I can't go that way because I might run into the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (4,4), so if I move left, I go towards x=7-1=6, which is still safe, but moving further left would approach (4,4). So, if I move left now, I would be at (6,4). Then, the next move, I could go left again to (5,4), then perhaps up or something. But I need to avoid (4,4).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving up first is safer because it gets me away from the enemy.\n\nSo, if I move up to (7,5), that's a safe move. Then, next move, I can go left to (6,5), then left again to (5,5), then left to (4,5) where the apple is. That would take three more moves after moving up.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (8,4) now, and then up to (8,5), then to (9,5) for the apple there. But that apple is further away.\n\nSo, which apple is closer? The one at (4,5) is 3 left and 1 up, total of 4 steps. The one at (9,5) is 2 right and 1 up, 3 steps. Wait, actually, from (7,4):\n\nTo (4,5): moving left 3 and up 1, but that's a diagonal, but in terms of steps, you have to move each direction one step at a time. So, from (7,4), moving up to (7,5) then left to (6,5), (5,5), (4,5): total 4 steps.\n\nTo (9,5): moving right to (8,4), then (9,4), then up to (9,5): 3 steps.\n\nHmm, that's closer. But wait, is there any risk in moving right? The enemy is at (4,4), so moving right towards x=8,9 shouldn't be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be safer because it gets me away from the enemy's position. But let me think about what's around.\n\nAfter moving right to (8,4), I'm at (8,4) next. Then, I can go to (9,4) and then up to (9,5) for the apple. But I should check if (9,5) is an apple. Yes, it is. So, that could be a plan.\n\nBut wait, in the board state provided, at row 5, the columns are 0,4,5, etc. So, (9,5) is indeed an apple.\n\nSo, moving to the right towards (9,5) in three steps is possible. Alternatively, moving up to (7,5) and then left to (4,5) would be four steps.\n\nBut which path is safer? Since the enemy is at (4,4), moving towards the right seems to avoid any potential conflicts, as the enemy is on the left side.\n\nAnother consideration is that moving right might put me near the edge of the board at x=9, but that's within bounds, so no problem.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up, I can go towards the apple at (1,7), which is much further away, but perhaps I can get there eventually.\n\nWait, but I don't need to decide the entire path right now; I just need to decide the next move. So, the options are up, down, left, or right.\n\nIf I move up, I go to (7,5), which is safe because there's nothing there except perhaps an apple at (4,5), but I'm not there yet.\n\nIf I move right, I go to (8,4), which is also safe because the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm moving away.\n\nIf I move left, I go to (6,4), which is towards the enemy, but it's still two units away, so that's probably safe now.\n\nIf I move down, I go to (7,3), which is empty as far as I can tell.\n\nSo, which direction is better?\n\nI think moving right to (8,4) makes sense because it gets me closer to the apple at (9,5). Alternatively, moving up to (7,5) starts me on the path to (4,5).\n\nBut I also have to think about the enemy. If the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm at (7,4), if I move left, I'm getting closer to the enemy, but moving right or up moves me away. So, to avoid potential conflict, moving away from the enemy might be safer.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (8,4) seems like a good option. Then, in the next moves, I can move right again to (9,4) and then up to (9,5) to eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving up might be better because it gets me closer to the apple at (4,5), but I have to make sure that path is clear.\n\nWait, perhaps moving left to (6,4) is also an option, but that's towards the enemy. But since the enemy is at (4,4), moving left to (6,4), then (5,4), then I can decide to go up to avoid the enemy.\n\nBut that might be more complicated. I think moving right to (8,4) is safer because I'm not approaching the enemy.\n\nSo, I think I'll choose to move right next.\n</think>\n\nTo get closer to the apple at (9,5) and avoid potential conflict with the enemy at (4,4), I'll move right to (8,4).\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm controlling snake ID 1, which is currently at (9,4). The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, my snake is at the far right side, somewhere in the middle vertically.\n\nApples are located at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), (1,7), and (5,4). My next move was RIGHT, which I decided last turn to move towards the apple at (9,5) and avoid the enemy at (4,4). So I went from (9,4) to (8,4). Wait, no, moving RIGHT would increase the x-coordinate, so from (9,4) moving RIGHT would take me to (10,4), which is outside the board. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake last time. Because moving RIGHT from (9,4) would go to (10,4), which is a wall, so that would cause me to die. Oh no, that's bad. So maybe I should reconsider.\n\nWait, no, in the previous move, I was at (9,4) and the last move was RIGHT, so that would have taken me to (8,4)? No, because moving RIGHT increases x, so from 9 to 10, which is outside. So perhaps I miswrote the last move. Or perhaps the snake can't move right from (9,4) because it's at the edge.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's last move information says they moved RIGHT to (8,4). But wait, from (9,4), moving RIGHT would take you to (10,4), which is a wall. So maybe there's a confusion here. Perhaps they meant to move LEFT to (8,4). Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the coordinates work.\n\nWait, the user's last move was RIGHT, leading to (8,4). So maybe the snake moved from (9,4) to (8,4) by going LEFT? Because moving RIGHT from x=9 would go beyond the board. So perhaps that's a mistake in the last move. Alternatively, maybe the snake can't move RIGHT from (9,4) because it's blocked by the wall, so it somehow stayed put? Or maybe the enemy is blocking.\n\nWait, looking at the board state, in row 4, at (5,4) there's an apple, and at (9,4) is my snake. Enemy snake #2 is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, in row 4, the positions are clear except for the apple at (5,4) and my position at (9,4). So moving LEFT from (9,4) would take me to (8,4), which is empty. So perhaps the last move was LEFT, not RIGHT. So maybe there was a mistake in the previous move.\n\nWait, the last move info says: \"Direction: RIGHT, Rationale: To move towards the apple at (9,5) and avoid the enemy at (4,4), I'll go right to (8,4).\" Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because moving RIGHT from (9,4) would take me to (10,4), which is a wall, causing me to die. So maybe the user made a mistake in the last move. So perhaps the correct move was LEFT to (8,4), because moving RIGHT from (9,4) is invalid.\n\nSo, now, after the last move, I'm at (8,4). What's the current state? Let me check the board again.\n\nThe apples are at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4). My snake is at (8,4). Enemy snake #2 is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, the enemy is in row 5, column 3 and 4. So, enemy is not blocking me in row 4.\n\nLooking at my position, (8,4), I need to decide the next move. The goal is to eat an apple to grow and gain points. So, which apple is closest?\n\nApples at (5,4) is in the same row, 3 units to the left. Apple at (9,5) is one unit up from my current position if I go to (8,5). Wait, (9,5) is at column 9, row 5. So from (8,4), moving up once would take me to (8,5), which is empty. Then moving RIGHT to (9,5) would get me the apple. So that's a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,4) is to the left, but that's 3 moves away. But moving towards (9,5) is closer. Also, since I'm at (8,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,4), which is my previous position, but that's not helpful. Wait, but (9,5) is an apple, so I could go up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) to eat it.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (5,4) is in the same row, so maybe I should go there first. But it's 3 moves to the left. However, moving towards (9,5) is only two moves: up then right.\n\nBut I should also be cautious about the enemy. The enemy snake is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, row 5, columns 3 and 4. So, if I move up to (8,5), I'm at column 8, which is far from the enemy. So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT to (7,4) to head towards (5,4) is better. But let's see which apple is closer.\n\nFrom (8,4):\n\n- To (5,4): distance is 3 (left 3 times).\n- To (9,5): distance is 2 (up once, then right once).\n\nSo, (9,5) is closer. So moving towards (9,5) seems better.\n\nBut wait, if I move up to (8,5), then right to (9,5), I can get the apple. But I need to check if any enemy is in the way. Since the enemy is at (3,5) and (4,5), they're to the left of (8,5), so no collision there.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) would let me eat the apple. Then I grow by one, gain a point, and my snake becomes longer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving to (7,4) first, but that seems less efficient.\n\nWait, is there any other apple closer? No, the other apples are at (0,5), (0,4), and (1,7), which are much farther.\n\nSo, plan is to move UP to (8,5), then RIGHT to (9,5) to get the apple.\n\nWait, but after moving up, I'll be at (8,5). Is that position safe? Let me check the board. At row 5, the enemy is at (3,5) and (4,5), so (8,5) is clear.\n\nSo, moving UP is safe. So next move should be UP.\n\nWait, but another thought: after moving to (8,5), I'm moving towards (9,5), which is an apple. But what if the enemy moves towards that area? But in this turn, it's my move first, so I can take the apple before the enemy does.\n\nAlso, considering that moving to (8,5) doesn't block me from other paths, seems safe.\n\nAnother consideration: if I go up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) to eat the apple, that's two moves. But I can only make one move now, so in this turn, I will move UP to (8,5), and in the next turn, move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nSo, I should decide to move UP now.\n\nWait, but the current position is (8,4). So moving UP would go to (8,5), which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, could I go RIGHT to (9,4), but that's moving back to where I was, which isn't helpful unless I'm trying to get to (9,5) from there. But from (9,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (10,4), which is a wall, so that's not possible. So from (8,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,4), which is okay, but then I'm back where I was, not moving towards the apple. So moving UP seems better.\n\nWait, from (8,4), moving RIGHT goes to (9,4), which is my previous position. But that's possible if I want to turn around. But moving UP seems more strategic towards the apple.\n\nSo, the decision is to move UP to (8,5), heading towards (9,5) to eat the apple.\n</think>\n\nNext, I will move UP to (8,5) to approach the apple at (9,5). This move is safe and brings me closer to an apple, allowing me to grow and gain a point.\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (7,4), which is on the x=7 line, y=4. The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, I'm somewhere in the middle right area of the board.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are several: at (0,5), (9,5), (4,5), (0,4), and (1,7). So, one is at (0,4) which is right at the bottom left corner, one at (1,7) which is a bit up on the left, and others are spread across the middle and right.\n\nThe enemy snake, Snake #2, is at (4,4) with an empty body, which probably means it's just the head. My snake is at (7,4), so we're both on the same y level, but on different x coordinates.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. The rules say that moving into an apple makes me grow and gain a point. If I hit a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nSo, my first thought is to look for the nearest apple. The apples are at (0,5), (9,5), (4,5), (0,4), and (1,7). My current position is (7,4). Let me calculate the distances.\n\nFrom (7,4) to (0,4): that's a distance of 7 units to the left. To (0,5): diagonal up and left, so longer. To (9,5): that's moving right to x=9, which is 2 units to the right and up 1, but that's quite far. To (4,5): that's left 3 units and up 1. To (1,7): left 6 units and up 3.\n\nBut let's see, the closest apples would be the ones at (4,5) and (1,7). Alternatively, maybe there's an apple at (0,4), but that's 7 units left. However, looking at the board state, I see that at (4,5), there's an apple, and also at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), and (1,7). Wait, but the current position is (7,4), so the apple at (4,5) is 3 units to the left and 1 unit up. Alternatively, the apple at (1,7) is 6 units left and 3 up.\n\nWait, let me visualize the board again. My snake is at (7,4). Let me look at the board rows. Row 4 is where my snake is, at x=7. So, moving up in y is towards higher y values.\n\nLooking for the nearest apple, perhaps the apple at (4,5) is closer. To get there, I need to move left to x=4 and up to y=5. That would require moving left 3 times and then up once, but each move is one step. Alternatively, moving up first to y=5 and then left to x=4. But I need to make sure that I don't run into anything.\n\nWait, but Snake #2 is at (4,4). So, if I move left to (6,4), then to (5,4), (4,4), I would run into Snake #2, which would cause me to die. So, that's a problem. So, moving left directly might not be safe. Alternatively, I could move up first.\n\nFrom (7,4), if I move up to (7,5), that's a safe move because there's nothing there. Then, I can move left to (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), which is an apple. So that seems like a plan. But wait, is (7,5) free? Let me check the apples. Yes, the apples are at (0,5), (4,5), etc. But on the board state, at y=5, x=4 is an apple, so yes, moving to (4,5) is safe, but getting there requires moving through (7,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right to (8,4), (9,4), but I don't see an apple there. The apples are at (9,5), which would require moving up after moving right. But that's two steps away: right to (8,4), then right to (9,4), then up to (9,5). But I don't know if there's a snake or wall in the way, but since it's within the 0-9 range, no walls.\n\nWait, but if I move right to x=8, then x=9, then up to (9,5), that's two moves. But I need to check if there's anything blocking. The only enemy is at (4,4), so that's not in the way. So, that's a possibility.\n\nWait, but the apple at (4,5) is closer in terms of steps. Let me map it out:\n\nOption 1: Move UP to (7,5), then LEFT three times to (4,5).\n\nThat's four moves: up, left, left, left.\n\nBut each turn, I can only move once. So, perhaps in the next move, I should go up.\n\nOption 2: Move RIGHT to (8,4), then to (9,4), then up to (9,5). That's three moves.\n\nBut wait, I have to think about what to do next. But the question is, what's my next move, so I need to decide whether to go up, right, down, or left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left to (6,4) but that's towards the enemy at (4,4), so I can't go that way because I might run into the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (4,4), so if I move left, I go towards x=7-1=6, which is still safe, but moving further left would approach (4,4). So, if I move left now, I would be at (6,4). Then, the next move, I could go left again to (5,4), then perhaps up or something. But I need to avoid (4,4).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving up first is safer because it gets me away from the enemy.\n\nSo, if I move up to (7,5), that's a safe move. Then, next move, I can go left to (6,5), then left again to (5,5), then left to (4,5) where the apple is. That would take three more moves after moving up.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (8,4) now, and then up to (8,5), then to (9,5) for the apple there. But that apple is further away.\n\nSo, which apple is closer? The one at (4,5) is 3 left and 1 up, total of 4 steps. The one at (9,5) is 2 right and 1 up, 3 steps. Wait, actually, from (7,4):\n\nTo (4,5): moving left 3 and up 1, but that's a diagonal, but in terms of steps, you have to move each direction one step at a time. So, from (7,4), moving up to (7,5) then left to (6,5), (5,5), (4,5): total 4 steps.\n\nTo (9,5): moving right to (8,4), then (9,4), then up to (9,5): 3 steps.\n\nHmm, that's closer. But wait, is there any risk in moving right? The enemy is at (4,4), so moving right towards x=8,9 shouldn't be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be safer because it gets me away from the enemy's position. But let me think about what's around.\n\nAfter moving right to (8,4), I'm at (8,4) next. Then, I can go to (9,4) and then up to (9,5) for the apple. But I should check if (9,5) is an apple. Yes, it is. So, that could be a plan.\n\nBut wait, in the board state provided, at row 5, the columns are 0,4,5, etc. So, (9,5) is indeed an apple.\n\nSo, moving to the right towards (9,5) in three steps is possible. Alternatively, moving up to (7,5) and then left to (4,5) would be four steps.\n\nBut which path is safer? Since the enemy is at (4,4), moving towards the right seems to avoid any potential conflicts, as the enemy is on the left side.\n\nAnother consideration is that moving right might put me near the edge of the board at x=9, but that's within bounds, so no problem.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up, I can go towards the apple at (1,7), which is much further away, but perhaps I can get there eventually.\n\nWait, but I don't need to decide the entire path right now; I just need to decide the next move. So, the options are up, down, left, or right.\n\nIf I move up, I go to (7,5), which is safe because there's nothing there except perhaps an apple at (4,5), but I'm not there yet.\n\nIf I move right, I go to (8,4), which is also safe because the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm moving away.\n\nIf I move left, I go to (6,4), which is towards the enemy, but it's still two units away, so that's probably safe now.\n\nIf I move down, I go to (7,3), which is empty as far as I can tell.\n\nSo, which direction is better?\n\nI think moving right to (8,4) makes sense because it gets me closer to the apple at (9,5). Alternatively, moving up to (7,5) starts me on the path to (4,5).\n\nBut I also have to think about the enemy. If the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm at (7,4), if I move left, I'm getting closer to the enemy, but moving right or up moves me away. So, to avoid potential conflict, moving away from the enemy might be safer.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (8,4) seems like a good option. Then, in the next moves, I can move right again to (9,4) and then up to (9,5) to eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving up might be better because it gets me closer to the apple at (4,5), but I have to make sure that path is clear.\n\nWait, perhaps moving left to (6,4) is also an option, but that's towards the enemy. But since the enemy is at (4,4), moving left to (6,4), then (5,4), then I can decide to go up to avoid the enemy.\n\nBut that might be more complicated. I think moving right to (8,4) is safer because I'm not approaching the enemy.\n\nSo, I think I'll choose to move right next.\n</think>\n\nTo get closer to the apple at (9,5) and avoid potential conflict with the enemy at (4,4), I'll move right to (8,4).\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm controlling snake ID 1, which is currently at (9,4). The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, my snake is at the far right side, somewhere in the middle vertically.\n\nApples are located at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), (1,7), and (5,4). My next move was RIGHT, which I decided last turn to move towards the apple at (9,5) and avoid the enemy at (4,4). So I went from (9,4) to (8,4). Wait, no, moving RIGHT would increase the x-coordinate, so from (9,4) moving RIGHT would take me to (10,4), which is outside the board. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake last time. Because moving RIGHT from (9,4) would go to (10,4), which is a wall, so that would cause me to die. Oh no, that's bad. So maybe I should reconsider.\n\nWait, no, in the previous move, I was at (9,4) and the last move was RIGHT, so that would have taken me to (8,4)? No, because moving RIGHT increases x, so from 9 to 10, which is outside. So perhaps I miswrote the last move. Or perhaps the snake can't move right from (9,4) because it's at the edge.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's last move information says they moved RIGHT to (8,4). But wait, from (9,4), moving RIGHT would take you to (10,4), which is a wall. So maybe there's a confusion here. Perhaps they meant to move LEFT to (8,4). Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the coordinates work.\n\nWait, the user's last move was RIGHT, leading to (8,4). So maybe the snake moved from (9,4) to (8,4) by going LEFT? Because moving RIGHT from x=9 would go beyond the board. So perhaps that's a mistake in the last move. Alternatively, maybe the snake can't move RIGHT from (9,4) because it's blocked by the wall, so it somehow stayed put? Or maybe the enemy is blocking.\n\nWait, looking at the board state, in row 4, at (5,4) there's an apple, and at (9,4) is my snake. Enemy snake #2 is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, in row 4, the positions are clear except for the apple at (5,4) and my position at (9,4). So moving LEFT from (9,4) would take me to (8,4), which is empty. So perhaps the last move was LEFT, not RIGHT. So maybe there was a mistake in the previous move.\n\nWait, the last move info says: \"Direction: RIGHT, Rationale: To move towards the apple at (9,5) and avoid the enemy at (4,4), I'll go right to (8,4).\" Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because moving RIGHT from (9,4) would take me to (10,4), which is a wall, causing me to die. So maybe the user made a mistake in the last move. So perhaps the correct move was LEFT to (8,4), because moving RIGHT from (9,4) is invalid.\n\nSo, now, after the last move, I'm at (8,4). What's the current state? Let me check the board again.\n\nThe apples are at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4). My snake is at (8,4). Enemy snake #2 is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, the enemy is in row 5, column 3 and 4. So, enemy is not blocking me in row 4.\n\nLooking at my position, (8,4), I need to decide the next move. The goal is to eat an apple to grow and gain points. So, which apple is closest?\n\nApples at (5,4) is in the same row, 3 units to the left. Apple at (9,5) is one unit up from my current position if I go to (8,5). Wait, (9,5) is at column 9, row 5. So from (8,4), moving up once would take me to (8,5), which is empty. Then moving RIGHT to (9,5) would get me the apple. So that's a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,4) is to the left, but that's 3 moves away. But moving towards (9,5) is closer. Also, since I'm at (8,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,4), which is my previous position, but that's not helpful. Wait, but (9,5) is an apple, so I could go up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) to eat it.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (5,4) is in the same row, so maybe I should go there first. But it's 3 moves to the left. However, moving towards (9,5) is only two moves: up then right.\n\nBut I should also be cautious about the enemy. The enemy snake is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, row 5, columns 3 and 4. So, if I move up to (8,5), I'm at column 8, which is far from the enemy. So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT to (7,4) to head towards (5,4) is better. But let's see which apple is closer.\n\nFrom (8,4):\n\n- To (5,4): distance is 3 (left 3 times).\n- To (9,5): distance is 2 (up once, then right once).\n\nSo, (9,5) is closer. So moving towards (9,5) seems better.\n\nBut wait, if I move up to (8,5), then right to (9,5), I can get the apple. But I need to check if any enemy is in the way. Since the enemy is at (3,5) and (4,5), they're to the left of (8,5), so no collision there.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) would let me eat the apple. Then I grow by one, gain a point, and my snake becomes longer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving to (7,4) first, but that seems less efficient.\n\nWait, is there any other apple closer? No, the other apples are at (0,5), (0,4), and (1,7), which are much farther.\n\nSo, plan is to move UP to (8,5), then RIGHT to (9,5) to get the apple.\n\nWait, but after moving up, I'll be at (8,5). Is that position safe? Let me check the board. At row 5, the enemy is at (3,5) and (4,5), so (8,5) is clear.\n\nSo, moving UP is safe. So next move should be UP.\n\nWait, but another thought: after moving to (8,5), I'm moving towards (9,5), which is an apple. But what if the enemy moves towards that area? But in this turn, it's my move first, so I can take the apple before the enemy does.\n\nAlso, considering that moving to (8,5) doesn't block me from other paths, seems safe.\n\nAnother consideration: if I go up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) to eat the apple, that's two moves. But I can only make one move now, so in this turn, I will move UP to (8,5), and in the next turn, move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nSo, I should decide to move UP now.\n\nWait, but the current position is (8,4). So moving UP would go to (8,5), which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, could I go RIGHT to (9,4), but that's moving back to where I was, which isn't helpful unless I'm trying to get to (9,5) from there. But from (9,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (10,4), which is a wall, so that's not possible. So from (8,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,4), which is okay, but then I'm back where I was, not moving towards the apple. So moving UP seems better.\n\nWait, from (8,4), moving RIGHT goes to (9,4), which is my previous position. But that's possible if I want to turn around. But moving UP seems more strategic towards the apple.\n\nSo, the decision is to move UP to (8,5), heading towards (9,5) to eat the apple.\n</think>\n\nNext, I will move UP to (8,5) to approach the apple at (9,5). This move is safe and brings me closer to an apple, allowing me to grow and gain a point.\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake #1 in this 10x10 board. My current position is at (9,6), and I just moved up to get here. Let me try to figure out my next move.\n\nFirst, let me recall the board state. The apples are at (0,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4), (7,4). So, the closest ones to me would probably be (5,4) and (7,4). But I need to check the positions of the other snake, Snake #2, which is at (1,5) with a body at (2,5). That's on the opposite side of the board, so maybe not a direct threat right now.\n\nMy last move was UP, which took me from (9,5) to (9,6). I was heading towards the apple at (9,5), but wait, no, looking back, the apples don't include (9,5). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me re-examine the apples: (0,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4), (7,4). So the only apple near me is if I go down to (9,5) or (9,4), but those don't have apples. Wait, looking back at the board state, I see that at (9,6) there's the snake head, and at (9,5) there's a 'T', but that might be an apple. Wait, no, the apples are listed as specific points, so perhaps the 'T's on the board are something else.\n\nWait, the board state is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again:\n\nRow 9: all dots except (9,9), I think. Wait, the coordinates increase upwards and to the right. So row 9 is the top, and column 9 is the rightmost. So looking at the board, each row is numbered from 9 downwards to 0. So at y=9, x=9 is the top right.\n\nWait, I think I might be getting the rows and columns mixed up. Let me clarify: the board is presented with row 9 at the top, and each row goes from x=0 to x=9. So the first line is y=9, then y=8, down to y=0. So when the snake is at (9,6), that's x=9, y=6, which would be on row 6, the furthest right column.\n\nLooking back at the board, at row 6 (which is the line starting with 6.), there's a dot at (6,9), and my snake is at (9,6), which is correct because my position is (9,6), so that's on row 6, column 9.\n\nThe apples are at:\n\n(0,5): x=0, y=5 \u2192 row 5, column 0.\n\n(0,4): row 4, column 0.\n\n(1,7): row 7, column 1.\n\n(5,4): row 4, column 5.\n\n(7,4): row 4, column7.\n\nSo, the closest apple to me is (5,4) and (7,4). Let me check the distance.\n\nI'm at (9,6). To reach (5,4), it's 4 steps left and 2 steps down. To reach (7,4), it's 2 steps left and 2 steps down.\n\nBut I need to see if the path is clear. However, moving towards (7,4) would be shorter, but I also have to avoid any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy snake #2 is at (1,5) with body at (2,5). That's on the left side, so maybe I don't have to worry about it right now.\n\nSo, I should plan a path towards the nearest apple. Since I'm at (9,6), moving left (decreasing x) would take me towards the center. But I should check the possible directions to see what's safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT, I'll go to (8,6). Is that safe? Let me check the board. At row 6, x=8 is a dot, so it's empty. Also, moving left is towards the apples at x=7,5, etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (9,6) would take me to (9,5), which on the board is labeled as 'A' and has a 'T' next to it, but according to the apple list, (9,5) isn't an apple. Wait, the apples are at (0,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4), (7,4). So (9,5) isn't an apple. Therefore, moving down to (9,5) might not be helpful unless there's an apple there that I'm missing. Wait, maybe I misread the board. Let me check the board description again.\n\nLooking at the board description, it says:\n\n5 A 2 T . . . . . . T\n\nSo at row 5, x=0 is A (apple), x=1 is 2 (snake #2), x=2 is T. Then from x=3 onwards, dots, until x=7 is A, x=8 is A, and x=9 is T.\n\nWait, no, the board's row 5 is:\n\nAt row 5 (y=5), the positions are:\n\nx=0: A (apple)\n\nx=1: 2 (snake head)\n\nx=2: T\n\nx=3: empty\n\nx=4: empty\n\nx=5: empty\n\nx=6: empty\n\nx=7: A (apple)\n\nx=8: A (apple)\n\nx=9: T.\n\nWait, so at x=9, y=5 is T, which I think stands for an apple that's taken or maybe an enemy's tail? Or perhaps it's just another symbol. But according to the apple positions given, only (0,5) is an apple, not (9,5). So my mistake earlier; moving down to (9,5) isn't helpful because there's no apple there.\n\nTherefore, my best bet is to move towards the apple at (7,4). Let me plan the path.\n\nFrom (9,6), I can move left to (8,6), then left to (7,6). From there, moving down to (7,5), then down again to (7,4), which is an apple.\n\nAlternatively, I can go down first to (9,5), but since there's no apple, that's not helpful. So moving left is better.\n\nLet me check if moving left is safe. The board shows at (8,6) is empty, and (7,6) is also empty. Then, moving down from (7,6) to (7,5), which is empty, and then to (7,4) for the apple.\n\nSo the next move should be LEFT to (8,6).\n\nWait, but maybe moving down first from (9,6) to (9,5) and then moving left? Let me see. (9,5) is a 'T', which I'm not sure what it is. Maybe it's the tail of another snake? If that's the case, moving there would cause me to collide with the tail, resulting in death. So I should avoid (9,5).\n\nTherefore, moving left is safer. So my next move is LEFT.\n\nBut wait, I just moved up to (9,6), so moving left from here is possible. Let me confirm that there are no other snakes or walls blocking me.\n\nThe board shows no other snakes near the right side except snake #2 on the left. So moving left is clear.\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nI'll move left to head towards the apple at (7,4). \n\nUP\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (7,4), which is on the x=7 line, y=4. The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, I'm somewhere in the middle right area of the board.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are several: at (0,5), (9,5), (4,5), (0,4), and (1,7). So, one is at (0,4) which is right at the bottom left corner, one at (1,7) which is a bit up on the left, and others are spread across the middle and right.\n\nThe enemy snake, Snake #2, is at (4,4) with an empty body, which probably means it's just the head. My snake is at (7,4), so we're both on the same y level, but on different x coordinates.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. The rules say that moving into an apple makes me grow and gain a point. If I hit a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nSo, my first thought is to look for the nearest apple. The apples are at (0,5), (9,5), (4,5), (0,4), and (1,7). My current position is (7,4). Let me calculate the distances.\n\nFrom (7,4) to (0,4): that's a distance of 7 units to the left. To (0,5): diagonal up and left, so longer. To (9,5): that's moving right to x=9, which is 2 units to the right and up 1, but that's quite far. To (4,5): that's left 3 units and up 1. To (1,7): left 6 units and up 3.\n\nBut let's see, the closest apples would be the ones at (4,5) and (1,7). Alternatively, maybe there's an apple at (0,4), but that's 7 units left. However, looking at the board state, I see that at (4,5), there's an apple, and also at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), and (1,7). Wait, but the current position is (7,4), so the apple at (4,5) is 3 units to the left and 1 unit up. Alternatively, the apple at (1,7) is 6 units left and 3 up.\n\nWait, let me visualize the board again. My snake is at (7,4). Let me look at the board rows. Row 4 is where my snake is, at x=7. So, moving up in y is towards higher y values.\n\nLooking for the nearest apple, perhaps the apple at (4,5) is closer. To get there, I need to move left to x=4 and up to y=5. That would require moving left 3 times and then up once, but each move is one step. Alternatively, moving up first to y=5 and then left to x=4. But I need to make sure that I don't run into anything.\n\nWait, but Snake #2 is at (4,4). So, if I move left to (6,4), then to (5,4), (4,4), I would run into Snake #2, which would cause me to die. So, that's a problem. So, moving left directly might not be safe. Alternatively, I could move up first.\n\nFrom (7,4), if I move up to (7,5), that's a safe move because there's nothing there. Then, I can move left to (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), which is an apple. So that seems like a plan. But wait, is (7,5) free? Let me check the apples. Yes, the apples are at (0,5), (4,5), etc. But on the board state, at y=5, x=4 is an apple, so yes, moving to (4,5) is safe, but getting there requires moving through (7,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right to (8,4), (9,4), but I don't see an apple there. The apples are at (9,5), which would require moving up after moving right. But that's two steps away: right to (8,4), then right to (9,4), then up to (9,5). But I don't know if there's a snake or wall in the way, but since it's within the 0-9 range, no walls.\n\nWait, but if I move right to x=8, then x=9, then up to (9,5), that's two moves. But I need to check if there's anything blocking. The only enemy is at (4,4), so that's not in the way. So, that's a possibility.\n\nWait, but the apple at (4,5) is closer in terms of steps. Let me map it out:\n\nOption 1: Move UP to (7,5), then LEFT three times to (4,5).\n\nThat's four moves: up, left, left, left.\n\nBut each turn, I can only move once. So, perhaps in the next move, I should go up.\n\nOption 2: Move RIGHT to (8,4), then to (9,4), then up to (9,5). That's three moves.\n\nBut wait, I have to think about what to do next. But the question is, what's my next move, so I need to decide whether to go up, right, down, or left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left to (6,4) but that's towards the enemy at (4,4), so I can't go that way because I might run into the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (4,4), so if I move left, I go towards x=7-1=6, which is still safe, but moving further left would approach (4,4). So, if I move left now, I would be at (6,4). Then, the next move, I could go left again to (5,4), then perhaps up or something. But I need to avoid (4,4).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving up first is safer because it gets me away from the enemy.\n\nSo, if I move up to (7,5), that's a safe move. Then, next move, I can go left to (6,5), then left again to (5,5), then left to (4,5) where the apple is. That would take three more moves after moving up.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (8,4) now, and then up to (8,5), then to (9,5) for the apple there. But that apple is further away.\n\nSo, which apple is closer? The one at (4,5) is 3 left and 1 up, total of 4 steps. The one at (9,5) is 2 right and 1 up, 3 steps. Wait, actually, from (7,4):\n\nTo (4,5): moving left 3 and up 1, but that's a diagonal, but in terms of steps, you have to move each direction one step at a time. So, from (7,4), moving up to (7,5) then left to (6,5), (5,5), (4,5): total 4 steps.\n\nTo (9,5): moving right to (8,4), then (9,4), then up to (9,5): 3 steps.\n\nHmm, that's closer. But wait, is there any risk in moving right? The enemy is at (4,4), so moving right towards x=8,9 shouldn't be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be safer because it gets me away from the enemy's position. But let me think about what's around.\n\nAfter moving right to (8,4), I'm at (8,4) next. Then, I can go to (9,4) and then up to (9,5) for the apple. But I should check if (9,5) is an apple. Yes, it is. So, that could be a plan.\n\nBut wait, in the board state provided, at row 5, the columns are 0,4,5, etc. So, (9,5) is indeed an apple.\n\nSo, moving to the right towards (9,5) in three steps is possible. Alternatively, moving up to (7,5) and then left to (4,5) would be four steps.\n\nBut which path is safer? Since the enemy is at (4,4), moving towards the right seems to avoid any potential conflicts, as the enemy is on the left side.\n\nAnother consideration is that moving right might put me near the edge of the board at x=9, but that's within bounds, so no problem.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up, I can go towards the apple at (1,7), which is much further away, but perhaps I can get there eventually.\n\nWait, but I don't need to decide the entire path right now; I just need to decide the next move. So, the options are up, down, left, or right.\n\nIf I move up, I go to (7,5), which is safe because there's nothing there except perhaps an apple at (4,5), but I'm not there yet.\n\nIf I move right, I go to (8,4), which is also safe because the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm moving away.\n\nIf I move left, I go to (6,4), which is towards the enemy, but it's still two units away, so that's probably safe now.\n\nIf I move down, I go to (7,3), which is empty as far as I can tell.\n\nSo, which direction is better?\n\nI think moving right to (8,4) makes sense because it gets me closer to the apple at (9,5). Alternatively, moving up to (7,5) starts me on the path to (4,5).\n\nBut I also have to think about the enemy. If the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm at (7,4), if I move left, I'm getting closer to the enemy, but moving right or up moves me away. So, to avoid potential conflict, moving away from the enemy might be safer.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (8,4) seems like a good option. Then, in the next moves, I can move right again to (9,4) and then up to (9,5) to eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving up might be better because it gets me closer to the apple at (4,5), but I have to make sure that path is clear.\n\nWait, perhaps moving left to (6,4) is also an option, but that's towards the enemy. But since the enemy is at (4,4), moving left to (6,4), then (5,4), then I can decide to go up to avoid the enemy.\n\nBut that might be more complicated. I think moving right to (8,4) is safer because I'm not approaching the enemy.\n\nSo, I think I'll choose to move right next.\n</think>\n\nTo get closer to the apple at (9,5) and avoid potential conflict with the enemy at (4,4), I'll move right to (8,4).\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, my snake is at the far right side, somewhere in the middle vertically.\n\nApples are located at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), (1,7), and (5,4).

Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake last time. Because moving RIGHT from (9,4) would go to (10,4), which is a wall, so that would cause me to die. Oh no, that's bad. So maybe I should reconsider.\n\nWait, no, in the previous move, I was at (9,4) and the last move was RIGHT, so that would have taken me to (8,4)? No, because moving RIGHT increases x, so from 9 to 10, which is outside. So perhaps I miswrote the last move.

Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the coordinates work.\n\nWait, the user's last move was RIGHT, leading to (8,4). So maybe the snake moved from (9,4) to (8,4) by going LEFT? Because moving RIGHT from x=9 would go beyond the board. So perhaps that's a mistake in the last move. Alternatively, maybe the snake can't move RIGHT from (9,4) because it's blocked by the wall, so it somehow stayed put? Or maybe the enemy is blocking.\n\nWait, looking at the board state, in row 4, at (5,4) there's an apple, and at (9,4) is my snake. Enemy snake #2 is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, in row 4, the positions are clear except for the apple at (5,4) and my position at (9,4). So moving LEFT from (9,4) would take me to (8,4), which is empty. So perhaps the last move was LEFT, not RIGHT. So maybe there was a mistake in the previous move.\n\nWait, the last move info says: \"Direction: RIGHT, Rationale: To move towards the apple at (9,5) and avoid the enemy at (4,4), I'll go right to (8,4).\" Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because moving RIGHT from (9,4) would take me to (10,4), which is a wall, causing me to die. So maybe the user made a mistake in the last move. So perhaps the correct move was LEFT to (8,4), because moving RIGHT from (9,4) is invalid.\n\nSo, now, after the last move, I'm at (8,4). What's the current state? Let me check the board again.\n\nThe apples are at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4). My snake is at (8,4). Enemy snake #2 is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, the enemy is in row 5, column 3 and 4. So, enemy is not blocking me in row 4.\n\nLooking at my position, (8,4), I need to decide the next move. The goal is to eat an apple to grow and gain points. So, which apple is closest?\n\nApples at (5,4) is in the same row, 3 units to the left. Apple at (9,5) is one unit up from my current position if I go to (8,5). Wait, (9,5) is at column 9, row 5. So from (8,4), moving up once would take me to (8,5), which is empty. Then moving RIGHT to (9,5) would get me the apple. So that's a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,4) is to the left, but that's 3 moves away. But moving towards (9,5) is closer. Also, since I'm at (8,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,4), which is my previous position, but that's not helpful. Wait, but (9,5) is an apple, so I could go up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) to eat it.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (5,4) is in the same row, so maybe I should go there first. But it's 3 moves to the left. However, moving towards (9,5) is only two moves: up then right.\n\nBut I should also be cautious about the enemy. The enemy snake is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, row 5, columns 3 and 4. So, if I move up to (8,5), I'm at column 8, which is far from the enemy. So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT to (7,4) to head towards (5,4) is better. But let's see which apple is closer.\n\nFrom (8,4):\n\n- To (5,4): distance is 3 (left 3 times).\n- To (9,5): distance is 2 (up once, then right once).\n\nSo, (9,5) is closer. So moving towards (9,5) seems better.\n\nBut wait, if I move up to (8,5), then right to (9,5), I can get the apple. But I need to check if any enemy is in the way. Since the enemy is at (3,5) and (4,5), they're to the left of (8,5), so no collision there.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) would let me eat the apple. Then I grow by one, gain a point, and my snake becomes longer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving to (7,4) first, but that seems less efficient.\n\nWait, is there any other apple closer? No, the other apples are at (0,5), (0,4), and (1,7), which are much farther.\n\nSo, plan is to move UP to (8,5), then RIGHT to (9,5) to get the apple.\n\nWait, but after moving up, I'll be at (8,5). Is that position safe? Let me check the board. At row 5, the enemy is at (3,5) and (4,5), so (8,5) is clear.\n\nSo, moving UP is safe. So next move should be UP.\n\nWait, but another thought: after moving to (8,5), I'm moving towards (9,5), which is an apple. But what if the enemy moves towards that area? But in this turn, it's my move first, so I can take the apple before the enemy does.\n\nAlso, considering that moving to (8,5) doesn't block me from other paths, seems safe.\n\nAnother consideration: if I go up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) to eat the apple, that's two moves. But I can only make one move now, so in this turn, I will move UP to (8,5), and in the next turn, move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nSo, I should decide to move UP now.\n\nWait, but the current position is (8,4). So moving UP would go to (8,5), which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, could I go RIGHT to (9,4), but that's moving back to where I was, which isn't helpful unless I'm trying to get to (9,5) from there. But from (9,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (10,4), which is a wall, so that's not possible. So from (8,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,4), which is okay, but then I'm back where I was, not moving towards the apple. So moving UP seems better.\n\nWait, from (8,4), moving RIGHT goes to (9,4), which is my previous position. But that's possible if I want to turn around. But moving UP seems more strategic towards the apple.\n\nSo, the decision is to move UP to (8,5), heading towards (9,5) to eat the apple.\n</think>\n\nNext, I will move UP to (8,5) to approach the apple at (9,5). This move is safe and brings me closer to an apple, allowing me to grow and gain a point.\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake #1 in this 10x10 board. My current position is at (9,6), and I just moved up to get here. Let me try to figure out my next move.\n\nFirst, let me recall the board state. The apples are at (0,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4), (7,4). So, the closest ones to me would probably be (5,4) and (7,4). But I need to check the positions of the other snake, Snake #2, which is at (1,5) with a body at (2,5). That's on the opposite side of the board, so maybe not a direct threat right now.\n\nMy last move was UP, which took me from (9,5) to (9,6). I was heading towards the apple at (9,5), but wait, no, looking back, the apples don't include (9,5). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me re-examine the apples: (0,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4), (7,4). So the only apple near me is if I go down to (9,5) or (9,4), but those don't have apples. Wait, looking back at the board state, I see that at (9,6) there's the snake head, and at (9,5) there's a 'T', but that might be an apple. Wait, no, the apples are listed as specific points, so perhaps the 'T's on the board are something else.\n\nWait, the board state is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again:\n\nRow 9: all dots except (9,9), I think. Wait, the coordinates increase upwards and to the right. So row 9 is the top, and column 9 is the rightmost. So looking at the board, each row is numbered from 9 downwards to 0. So at y=9, x=9 is the top right.\n\nWait, I think I might be getting the rows and columns mixed up. Let me clarify: the board is presented with row 9 at the top, and each row goes from x=0 to x=9. So the first line is y=9, then y=8, down to y=0. So when the snake is at (9,6), that's x=9, y=6, which would be on row 6, the furthest right column.\n\nLooking back at the board, at row 6 (which is the line starting with 6.), there's a dot at (6,9), and my snake is at (9,6), which is correct because my position is (9,6), so that's on row 6, column 9.\n\nThe apples are at:\n\n(0,5): x=0, y=5 \u2192 row 5, column 0.\n\n(0,4): row 4, column 0.\n\n(1,7): row 7, column 1.\n\n(5,4): row 4, column 5.\n\n(7,4): row 4, column7.\n\nSo, the closest apple to me is (5,4) and (7,4). Let me check the distance.\n\nI'm at (9,6). To reach (5,4), it's 4 steps left and 2 steps down. To reach (7,4), it's 2 steps left and 2 steps down.\n\nBut I need to see if the path is clear. However, moving towards (7,4) would be shorter, but I also have to avoid any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy snake #2 is at (1,5) with body at (2,5). That's on the left side, so maybe I don't have to worry about it right now.\n\nSo, I should plan a path towards the nearest apple. Since I'm at (9,6), moving left (decreasing x) would take me towards the center. But I should check the possible directions to see what's safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT, I'll go to (8,6). Is that safe? Let me check the board. At row 6, x=8 is a dot, so it's empty. Also, moving left is towards the apples at x=7,5, etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (9,6) would take me to (9,5), which on the board is labeled as 'A' and has a 'T' next to it, but according to the apple list, (9,5) isn't an apple. Wait, the apples are at (0,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4), (7,4). So (9,5) isn't an apple. Therefore, moving down to (9,5) might not be helpful unless there's an apple there that I'm missing. Wait, maybe I misread the board. Let me check the board description again.\n\nLooking at the board description, it says:\n\n5 A 2 T . . . . . . T\n\nSo at row 5, x=0 is A (apple), x=1 is 2 (snake #2), x=2 is T. Then from x=3 onwards, dots, until x=7 is A, x=8 is A, and x=9 is T.\n\nWait, no, the board's row 5 is:\n\nAt row 5 (y=5), the positions are:\n\nx=0: A (apple)\n\nx=1: 2 (snake head)\n\nx=2: T\n\nx=3: empty\n\nx=4: empty\n\nx=5: empty\n\nx=6: empty\n\nx=7: A (apple)\n\nx=8: A (apple)\n\nx=9: T.\n\nWait, so at x=9, y=5 is T, which I think stands for an apple that's taken or maybe an enemy's tail? Or perhaps it's just another symbol. But according to the apple positions given, only (0,5) is an apple, not (9,5). So my mistake earlier; moving down to (9,5) isn't helpful because there's no apple there.\n\nTherefore, my best bet is to move towards the apple at (7,4). Let me plan the path.\n\nFrom (9,6), I can move left to (8,6), then left to (7,6). From there, moving down to (7,5), then down again to (7,4), which is an apple.\n\nAlternatively, I can go down first to (9,5), but since there's no apple, that's not helpful. So moving left is better.\n\nLet me check if moving left is safe. The board shows at (8,6) is empty, and (7,6) is also empty. Then, moving down from (7,6) to (7,5), which is empty, and then to (7,4) for the apple.\n\nSo the next move should be LEFT to (8,6).\n\nWait, but maybe moving down first from (9,6) to (9,5) and then moving left? Let me see. (9,5) is a 'T', which I'm not sure what it is. Maybe it's the tail of another snake? If that's the case, moving there would cause me to collide with the tail, resulting in death. So I should avoid (9,5).\n\nTherefore, moving left is safer. So my next move is LEFT.\n\nBut wait, I just moved up to (9,6), so moving left from here is possible. Let me confirm that there are no other snakes or walls blocking me.\n\nThe board shows no other snakes near the right side except snake #2 on the left. So moving left is clear.\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nI'll move left to head towards the apple at (7,4). \n\nUP\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (7,4), which is on the x=7 line, y=4. The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, I'm somewhere in the middle right area of the board.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are several: at (0,5), (9,5), (4,5), (0,4), and (1,7). So, one is at (0,4) which is right at the bottom left corner, one at (1,7) which is a bit up on the left, and others are spread across the middle and right.\n\nThe enemy snake, Snake #2, is at (4,4) with an empty body, which probably means it's just the head. My snake is at (7,4), so we're both on the same y level, but on different x coordinates.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. The rules say that moving into an apple makes me grow and gain a point. If I hit a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nSo, my first thought is to look for the nearest apple. The apples are at (0,5), (9,5), (4,5), (0,4), and (1,7). My current position is (7,4). Let me calculate the distances.\n\nFrom (7,4) to (0,4): that's a distance of 7 units to the left. To (0,5): diagonal up and left, so longer. To (9,5): that's moving right to x=9, which is 2 units to the right and up 1, but that's quite far. To (4,5): that's left 3 units and up 1. To (1,7): left 6 units and up 3.\n\nBut let's see, the closest apples would be the ones at (4,5) and (1,7). Alternatively, maybe there's an apple at (0,4), but that's 7 units left. However, looking at the board state, I see that at (4,5), there's an apple, and also at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), and (1,7). Wait, but the current position is (7,4), so the apple at (4,5) is 3 units to the left and 1 unit up. Alternatively, the apple at (1,7) is 6 units left and 3 up.\n\nWait, let me visualize the board again. My snake is at (7,4). Let me look at the board rows. Row 4 is where my snake is, at x=7. So, moving up in y is towards higher y values.\n\nLooking for the nearest apple, perhaps the apple at (4,5) is closer. To get there, I need to move left to x=4 and up to y=5. That would require moving left 3 times and then up once, but each move is one step. Alternatively, moving up first to y=5 and then left to x=4. But I need to make sure that I don't run into anything.\n\nWait, but Snake #2 is at (4,4). So, if I move left to (6,4), then to (5,4), (4,4), I would run into Snake #2, which would cause me to die. So, that's a problem. So, moving left directly might not be safe. Alternatively, I could move up first.\n\nFrom (7,4), if I move up to (7,5), that's a safe move because there's nothing there. Then, I can move left to (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), which is an apple. So that seems like a plan. But wait, is (7,5) free? Let me check the apples. Yes, the apples are at (0,5), (4,5), etc. But on the board state, at y=5, x=4 is an apple, so yes, moving to (4,5) is safe, but getting there requires moving through (7,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right to (8,4), (9,4), but I don't see an apple there. The apples are at (9,5), which would require moving up after moving right. But that's two steps away: right to (8,4), then right to (9,4), then up to (9,5). But I don't know if there's a snake or wall in the way, but since it's within the 0-9 range, no walls.\n\nWait, but if I move right to x=8, then x=9, then up to (9,5), that's two moves. But I need to check if there's anything blocking. The only enemy is at (4,4), so that's not in the way. So, that's a possibility.\n\nWait, but the apple at (4,5) is closer in terms of steps. Let me map it out:\n\nOption 1: Move UP to (7,5), then LEFT three times to (4,5).\n\nThat's four moves: up, left, left, left.\n\nBut each turn, I can only move once. So, perhaps in the next move, I should go up.\n\nOption 2: Move RIGHT to (8,4), then to (9,4), then up to (9,5). That's three moves.\n\nBut wait, I have to think about what to do next. But the question is, what's my next move, so I need to decide whether to go up, right, down, or left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left to (6,4) but that's towards the enemy at (4,4), so I can't go that way because I might run into the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (4,4), so if I move left, I go towards x=7-1=6, which is still safe, but moving further left would approach (4,4). So, if I move left now, I would be at (6,4). Then, the next move, I could go left again to (5,4), then perhaps up or something. But I need to avoid (4,4).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving up first is safer because it gets me away from the enemy.\n\nSo, if I move up to (7,5), that's a safe move. Then, next move, I can go left to (6,5), then left again to (5,5), then left to (4,5) where the apple is. That would take three more moves after moving up.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (8,4) now, and then up to (8,5), then to (9,5) for the apple there. But that apple is further away.\n\nSo, which apple is closer? The one at (4,5) is 3 left and 1 up, total of 4 steps. The one at (9,5) is 2 right and 1 up, 3 steps. Wait, actually, from (7,4):\n\nTo (4,5): moving left 3 and up 1, but that's a diagonal, but in terms of steps, you have to move each direction one step at a time. So, from (7,4), moving up to (7,5) then left to (6,5), (5,5), (4,5): total 4 steps.\n\nTo (9,5): moving right to (8,4), then (9,4), then up to (9,5): 3 steps.\n\nHmm, that's closer. But wait, is there any risk in moving right? The enemy is at (4,4), so moving right towards x=8,9 shouldn't be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be safer because it gets me away from the enemy's position. But let me think about what's around.\n\nAfter moving right to (8,4), I'm at (8,4) next. Then, I can go to (9,4) and then up to (9,5) for the apple. But I should check if (9,5) is an apple. Yes, it is. So, that could be a plan.\n\nBut wait, in the board state provided, at row 5, the columns are 0,4,5, etc. So, (9,5) is indeed an apple.\n\nSo, moving to the right towards (9,5) in three steps is possible. Alternatively, moving up to (7,5) and then left to (4,5) would be four steps.\n\nBut which path is safer? Since the enemy is at (4,4), moving towards the right seems to avoid any potential conflicts, as the enemy is on the left side.\n\nAnother consideration is that moving right might put me near the edge of the board at x=9, but that's within bounds, so no problem.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up, I can go towards the apple at (1,7), which is much further away, but perhaps I can get there eventually.\n\nWait, but I don't need to decide the entire path right now; I just need to decide the next move. So, the options are up, down, left, or right.\n\nIf I move up, I go to (7,5), which is safe because there's nothing there except perhaps an apple at (4,5), but I'm not there yet.\n\nIf I move right, I go to (8,4), which is also safe because the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm moving away.\n\nIf I move left, I go to (6,4), which is towards the enemy, but it's still two units away, so that's probably safe now.\n\nIf I move down, I go to (7,3), which is empty as far as I can tell.\n\nSo, which direction is better?\n\nI think moving right to (8,4) makes sense because it gets me closer to the apple at (9,5). Alternatively, moving up to (7,5) starts me on the path to (4,5).\n\nBut I also have to think about the enemy. If the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm at (7,4), if I move left, I'm getting closer to the enemy, but moving right or up moves me away. So, to avoid potential conflict, moving away from the enemy might be safer.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (8,4) seems like a good option. Then, in the next moves, I can move right again to (9,4) and then up to (9,5) to eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving up might be better because it gets me closer to the apple at (4,5), but I have to make sure that path is clear.\n\nWait, perhaps moving left to (6,4) is also an option, but that's towards the enemy. But since the enemy is at (4,4), moving left to (6,4), then (5,4), then I can decide to go up to avoid the enemy.\n\nBut that might be more complicated. I think moving right to (8,4) is safer because I'm not approaching the enemy.\n\nSo, I think I'll choose to move right next.\n</think>\n\nTo get closer to the apple at (9,5) and avoid potential conflict with the enemy at (4,4), I'll move right to (8,4).\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm controlling snake ID 1, which is currently at (9,4). The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, my snake is at the far right side, somewhere in the middle vertically.\n\nApples are located at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), (1,7), and (5,4). My next move was RIGHT, which I decided last turn to move towards the apple at (9,5) and avoid the enemy at (4,4). So I went from (9,4) to (8,4). Wait, no, moving RIGHT would increase the x-coordinate, so from (9,4) moving RIGHT would take me to (10,4), which is outside the board. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake last time. Because moving RIGHT from (9,4) would go to (10,4), which is a wall, so that would cause me to die. Oh no, that's bad. So maybe I should reconsider.\n\nWait, no, in the previous move, I was at (9,4) and the last move was RIGHT, so that would have taken me to (8,4)? No, because moving RIGHT increases x, so from 9 to 10, which is outside. So perhaps I miswrote the last move. Or perhaps the snake can't move right from (9,4) because it's at the edge.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's last move information says they moved RIGHT to (8,4). But wait, from (9,4), moving RIGHT would take you to (10,4), which is a wall. So maybe there's a confusion here. Perhaps they meant to move LEFT to (8,4). Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the coordinates work.\n\nWait, the user's last move was RIGHT, leading to (8,4). So maybe the snake moved from (9,4) to (8,4) by going LEFT? Because moving RIGHT from x=9 would go beyond the board. So perhaps that's a mistake in the last move. Alternatively, maybe the snake can't move RIGHT from (9,4) because it's blocked by the wall, so it somehow stayed put? Or maybe the enemy is blocking.\n\nWait, looking at the board state, in row 4, at (5,4) there's an apple, and at (9,4) is my snake. Enemy snake #2 is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, in row 4, the positions are clear except for the apple at (5,4) and my position at (9,4). So moving LEFT from (9,4) would take me to (8,4), which is empty. So perhaps the last move was LEFT, not RIGHT. So maybe there was a mistake in the previous move.\n\nWait, the last move info says: \"Direction: RIGHT, Rationale: To move towards the apple at (9,5) and avoid the enemy at (4,4), I'll go right to (8,4).\" Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because moving RIGHT from (9,4) would take me to (10,4), which is a wall, causing me to die. So maybe the user made a mistake in the last move. So perhaps the correct move was LEFT to (8,4), because moving RIGHT from (9,4) is invalid.\n\nSo, now, after the last move, I'm at (8,4). What's the current state? Let me check the board again.\n\nThe apples are at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4). My snake is at (8,4). Enemy snake #2 is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, the enemy is in row 5, column 3 and 4. So, enemy is not blocking me in row 4.\n\nLooking at my position, (8,4), I need to decide the next move. The goal is to eat an apple to grow and gain points. So, which apple is closest?\n\nApples at (5,4) is in the same row, 3 units to the left. Apple at (9,5) is one unit up from my current position if I go to (8,5). Wait, (9,5) is at column 9, row 5. So from (8,4), moving up once would take me to (8,5), which is empty. Then moving RIGHT to (9,5) would get me the apple. So that's a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,4) is to the left, but that's 3 moves away. But moving towards (9,5) is closer. Also, since I'm at (8,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,4), which is my previous position, but that's not helpful. Wait, but (9,5) is an apple, so I could go up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) to eat it.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (5,4) is in the same row, so maybe I should go there first. But it's 3 moves to the left. However, moving towards (9,5) is only two moves: up then right.\n\nBut I should also be cautious about the enemy. The enemy snake is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, row 5, columns 3 and 4. So, if I move up to (8,5), I'm at column 8, which is far from the enemy. So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT to (7,4) to head towards (5,4) is better. But let's see which apple is closer.\n\nFrom (8,4):\n\n- To (5,4): distance is 3 (left 3 times).\n- To (9,5): distance is 2 (up once, then right once).\n\nSo, (9,5) is closer. So moving towards (9,5) seems better.\n\nBut wait, if I move up to (8,5), then right to (9,5), I can get the apple. But I need to check if any enemy is in the way. Since the enemy is at (3,5) and (4,5), they're to the left of (8,5), so no collision there.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) would let me eat the apple. Then I grow by one, gain a point, and my snake becomes longer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving to (7,4) first, but that seems less efficient.\n\nWait, is there any other apple closer? No, the other apples are at (0,5), (0,4), and (1,7), which are much farther.\n\nSo, plan is to move UP to (8,5), then RIGHT to (9,5) to get the apple.\n\nWait, but after moving up, I'll be at (8,5). Is that position safe? Let me check the board. At row 5, the enemy is at (3,5) and (4,5), so (8,5) is clear.\n\nSo, moving UP is safe. So next move should be UP.\n\nWait, but another thought: after moving to (8,5), I'm moving towards (9,5), which is an apple. But what if the enemy moves towards that area? But in this turn, it's my move first, so I can take the apple before the enemy does.\n\nAlso, considering that moving to (8,5) doesn't block me from other paths, seems safe.\n\nAnother consideration: if I go up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) to eat the apple, that's two moves. But I can only make one move now, so in this turn, I will move UP to (8,5), and in the next turn, move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nSo, I should decide to move UP now.\n\nWait, but the current position is (8,4). So moving UP would go to (8,5), which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, could I go RIGHT to (9,4), but that's moving back to where I was, which isn't helpful unless I'm trying to get to (9,5) from there. But from (9,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (10,4), which is a wall, so that's not possible. So from (8,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,4), which is okay, but then I'm back where I was, not moving towards the apple. So moving UP seems better.\n\nWait, from (8,4), moving RIGHT goes to (9,4), which is my previous position. But that's possible if I want to turn around. But moving UP seems more strategic towards the apple.\n\nSo, the decision is to move UP to (8,5), heading towards (9,5) to eat the apple.\n</think>\n\nNext, I will move UP to (8,5) to approach the apple at (9,5). This move is safe and brings me closer to an apple, allowing me to grow and gain a point.\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake #1 in this 10x10 board. My current position is at (9,6), and I just moved up to get here. Let me try to figure out my next move.\n\nFirst, let me recall the board state. The apples are at (0,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4), (7,4). So, the closest ones to me would probably be (5,4) and (7,4). But I need to check the positions of the other snake, Snake #2, which is at (1,5) with a body at (2,5). That's on the opposite side of the board, so maybe not a direct threat right now.\n\nMy last move was UP, which took me from (9,5) to (9,6). I was heading towards the apple at (9,5), but wait, no, looking back, the apples don't include (9,5). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me re-examine the apples: (0,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4), (7,4). So the only apple near me is if I go down to (9,5) or (9,4), but those don't have apples. Wait, looking back at the board state, I see that at (9,6) there's the snake head, and at (9,5) there's a 'T', but that might be an apple. Wait, no, the apples are listed as specific points, so perhaps the 'T's on the board are something else.\n\nWait, the board state is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again:\n\nRow 9: all dots except (9,9), I think. Wait, the coordinates increase upwards and to the right. So row 9 is the top, and column 9 is the rightmost. So looking at the board, each row is numbered from 9 downwards to 0. So at y=9, x=9 is the top right.\n\nWait, I think I might be getting the rows and columns mixed up. Let me clarify: the board is presented with row 9 at the top, and each row goes from x=0 to x=9. So the first line is y=9, then y=8, down to y=0. So when the snake is at (9,6), that's x=9, y=6, which would be on row 6, the furthest right column.\n\nLooking back at the board, at row 6 (which is the line starting with 6.), there's a dot at (6,9), and my snake is at (9,6), which is correct because my position is (9,6), so that's on row 6, column 9.\n\nThe apples are at:\n\n(0,5): x=0, y=5 \u2192 row 5, column 0.\n\n(0,4): row 4, column 0.\n\n(1,7): row 7, column 1.\n\n(5,4): row 4, column 5.\n\n(7,4): row 4, column7.\n\nSo, the closest apple to me is (5,4) and (7,4). Let me check the distance.\n\nI'm at (9,6). To reach (5,4), it's 4 steps left and 2 steps down. To reach (7,4), it's 2 steps left and 2 steps down.\n\nBut I need to see if the path is clear. However, moving towards (7,4) would be shorter, but I also have to avoid any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy snake #2 is at (1,5) with body at (2,5). That's on the left side, so maybe I don't have to worry about it right now.\n\nSo, I should plan a path towards the nearest apple. Since I'm at (9,6), moving left (decreasing x) would take me towards the center. But I should check the possible directions to see what's safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT, I'll go to (8,6). Is that safe? Let me check the board. At row 6, x=8 is a dot, so it's empty. Also, moving left is towards the apples at x=7,5, etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (9,6) would take me to (9,5), which on the board is labeled as 'A' and has a 'T' next to it, but according to the apple list, (9,5) isn't an apple. Wait, the apples are at (0,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4), (7,4). So (9,5) isn't an apple. Therefore, moving down to (9,5) might not be helpful unless there's an apple there that I'm missing. Wait, maybe I misread the board. Let me check the board description again.\n\nLooking at the board description, it says:\n\n5 A 2 T . . . . . . T\n\nSo at row 5, x=0 is A (apple), x=1 is 2 (snake #2), x=2 is T. Then from x=3 onwards, dots, until x=7 is A, x=8 is A, and x=9 is T.\n\nWait, no, the board's row 5 is:\n\nAt row 5 (y=5), the positions are:\n\nx=0: A (apple)\n\nx=1: 2 (snake head)\n\nx=2: T\n\nx=3: empty\n\nx=4: empty\n\nx=5: empty\n\nx=6: empty\n\nx=7: A (apple)\n\nx=8: A (apple)\n\nx=9: T.\n\nWait, so at x=9, y=5 is T, which I think stands for an apple that's taken or maybe an enemy's tail? Or perhaps it's just another symbol. But according to the apple positions given, only (0,5) is an apple, not (9,5). So my mistake earlier; moving down to (9,5) isn't helpful because there's no apple there.\n\nTherefore, my best bet is to move towards the apple at (7,4). Let me plan the path.\n\nFrom (9,6), I can move left to (8,6), then left to (7,6). From there, moving down to (7,5), then down again to (7,4), which is an apple.\n\nAlternatively, I can go down first to (9,5), but since there's no apple, that's not helpful. So moving left is better.\n\nLet me check if moving left is safe. The board shows at (8,6) is empty, and (7,6) is also empty. Then, moving down from (7,6) to (7,5), which is empty, and then to (7,4) for the apple.\n\nSo the next move should be LEFT to (8,6).\n\nWait, but maybe moving down first from (9,6) to (9,5) and then moving left? Let me see. (9,5) is a 'T', which I'm not sure what it is. Maybe it's the tail of another snake? If that's the case, moving there would cause me to collide with the tail, resulting in death. So I should avoid (9,5).\n\nTherefore, moving left is safer. So my next move is LEFT.\n\nBut wait, I just moved up to (9,6), so moving left from here is possible. Let me confirm that there are no other snakes or walls blocking me.\n\nThe board shows no other snakes near the right side except snake #2 on the left. So moving left is clear.\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nI'll move left to head towards the apple at (7,4). \n\nUP\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake, snake ID 1, is currently at (7,6). There are several apples on the board: at (1,7), (5,4), (7,4), (1,6), and (6,3). \n\nLooking at where I am now, (7,6), I want to get to the nearest apple. The apples are at different positions, so I should calculate the distance from my current position to each apple to decide which one is closest.\n\nLet's calculate the distances:\n\n1. Apple at (1,7): The distance here is the sum of the horizontal and vertical differences. So, |7-1| + |6-7| = 6 + 1 = 7 units.\n2. Apple at (5,4): |7-5| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4 units.\n3. Apple at (7,4): This is directly below me, same x-coordinate. So, |7-7| + |6-4| = 0 + 2 = 2 units.\n4. Apple at (1,6): |7-1| + |6-6| = 6 + 0 = 6 units.\n5. Apple at (6,3): |7-6| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4 units.\n\nFrom these calculations, the closest apple is at (7,4), just two units below my current position. So that's my target.\n\nNow, I need to figure out the best path to get there without hitting anything. My snake is moving on a grid, so each move changes either the x or y coordinate by 1. Since the apple is directly below me on the same x-coordinate (7), I can just move down twice.\n\nBut wait, there's an enemy snake, snake ID 2, positioned at (0,4) with its body at [(0,5), (1,5), (2,5)]. I should check if moving down will cause me to collide with any part of this snake's body.\n\nLooking at snake 2's positions: it's at (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,5). None of these are on the same x-coordinate as me (7) or in the path I need to take. So, moving down from (7,6) to (7,5) and then to (7,4) shouldn't be a problem.\n\nBut let me double-check the board state provided. The board shows that at y=6, x=7, my snake's head is at (7,6). Below that, at y=5, x=7, it's empty. Similarly, at y=4, x=7, there's an apple. So, the path is clear.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving down, will I hit myself? My snake's body is moving forward, so as long as I don't make a U-turn into my own body, I should be fine. Since I'm moving down and my body is following, it shouldn't be an issue.\n\nWait, actually, my last move was LEFT, which was to get to (7,6) from maybe (8,6) or something? Hmm, I'm not sure about the previous positions of my body. But since the last move was LEFT and I'm now at (7,6), moving down should be okay as long as my body doesn't obscure that path. Since the board shows only my head at (7,6), I can assume the body is behind, so moving down is safe.\n\nSo, the plan is to move down once to (7,5), then again to (7,4) to eat the apple. But I need to decide the next single move. So the first step is to move down from (7,6) to (7,5). \n\nDo I have any other immediate threats or considerations? Let me check the other apples. The next closest after (7,4) is (5,4) and (6,3), both 4 units away. But since (7,4) is just two moves away, it's better to go for that first.\n\nAnother point to consider: growing by eating the apple will make my snake longer, which is good for blocking enemies and having more points. So it's beneficial to get it.\n\nPotential alternative: What if I decide to go for the apple at (5,4) instead? Let's see, from (7,6) to (5,4), I need to move left two times and down two times. That's four moves. Whereas (7,4) is just two moves. So it's more efficient to go for (7,4).\n\nAlso, I should check if there's any enemy nearby that could interfere. Snake 2 is at (0,4), which is far from my current position, so it won't block my path to (7,4).\n\nTherefore, the best move is to go DOWN to reach the apple at (7,4).\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (7,4), I'll move down from (7,6). This path is clear of obstacles and enemy snakes.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (7,4), which is on the x=7 line, y=4. The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, I'm somewhere in the middle right area of the board.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are several: at (0,5), (9,5), (4,5), (0,4), and (1,7). So, one is at (0,4) which is right at the bottom left corner, one at (1,7) which is a bit up on the left, and others are spread across the middle and right.\n\nThe enemy snake, Snake #2, is at (4,4) with an empty body, which probably means it's just the head. My snake is at (7,4), so we're both on the same y level, but on different x coordinates.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. The rules say that moving into an apple makes me grow and gain a point. If I hit a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nSo, my first thought is to look for the nearest apple. The apples are at (0,5), (9,5), (4,5), (0,4), and (1,7). My current position is (7,4). Let me calculate the distances.\n\nFrom (7,4) to (0,4): that's a distance of 7 units to the left. To (0,5): diagonal up and left, so longer. To (9,5): that's moving right to x=9, which is 2 units to the right and up 1, but that's quite far. To (4,5): that's left 3 units and up 1. To (1,7): left 6 units and up 3.\n\nBut let's see, the closest apples would be the ones at (4,5) and (1,7). Alternatively, maybe there's an apple at (0,4), but that's 7 units left. However, looking at the board state, I see that at (4,5), there's an apple, and also at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), and (1,7). Wait, but the current position is (7,4), so the apple at (4,5) is 3 units to the left and 1 unit up. Alternatively, the apple at (1,7) is 6 units left and 3 up.\n\nWait, let me visualize the board again. My snake is at (7,4). Let me look at the board rows. Row 4 is where my snake is, at x=7. So, moving up in y is towards higher y values.\n\nLooking for the nearest apple, perhaps the apple at (4,5) is closer. To get there, I need to move left to x=4 and up to y=5. That would require moving left 3 times and then up once, but each move is one step. Alternatively, moving up first to y=5 and then left to x=4. But I need to make sure that I don't run into anything.\n\nWait, but Snake #2 is at (4,4). So, if I move left to (6,4), then to (5,4), (4,4), I would run into Snake #2, which would cause me to die. So, that's a problem. So, moving left directly might not be safe. Alternatively, I could move up first.\n\nFrom (7,4), if I move up to (7,5), that's a safe move because there's nothing there. Then, I can move left to (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), which is an apple. So that seems like a plan. But wait, is (7,5) free? Let me check the apples. Yes, the apples are at (0,5), (4,5), etc. But on the board state, at y=5, x=4 is an apple, so yes, moving to (4,5) is safe, but getting there requires moving through (7,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right to (8,4), (9,4), but I don't see an apple there. The apples are at (9,5), which would require moving up after moving right. But that's two steps away: right to (8,4), then right to (9,4), then up to (9,5). But I don't know if there's a snake or wall in the way, but since it's within the 0-9 range, no walls.\n\nWait, but if I move right to x=8, then x=9, then up to (9,5), that's two moves. But I need to check if there's anything blocking. The only enemy is at (4,4), so that's not in the way. So, that's a possibility.\n\nWait, but the apple at (4,5) is closer in terms of steps. Let me map it out:\n\nOption 1: Move UP to (7,5), then LEFT three times to (4,5).\n\nThat's four moves: up, left, left, left.\n\nBut each turn, I can only move once. So, perhaps in the next move, I should go up.\n\nOption 2: Move RIGHT to (8,4), then to (9,4), then up to (9,5). That's three moves.\n\nBut wait, I have to think about what to do next. But the question is, what's my next move, so I need to decide whether to go up, right, down, or left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left to (6,4) but that's towards the enemy at (4,4), so I can't go that way because I might run into the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (4,4), so if I move left, I go towards x=7-1=6, which is still safe, but moving further left would approach (4,4). So, if I move left now, I would be at (6,4). Then, the next move, I could go left again to (5,4), then perhaps up or something. But I need to avoid (4,4).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving up first is safer because it gets me away from the enemy.\n\nSo, if I move up to (7,5), that's a safe move. Then, next move, I can go left to (6,5), then left again to (5,5), then left to (4,5) where the apple is. That would take three more moves after moving up.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (8,4) now, and then up to (8,5), then to (9,5) for the apple there. But that apple is further away.\n\nSo, which apple is closer? The one at (4,5) is 3 left and 1 up, total of 4 steps. The one at (9,5) is 2 right and 1 up, 3 steps. Wait, actually, from (7,4):\n\nTo (4,5): moving left 3 and up 1, but that's a diagonal, but in terms of steps, you have to move each direction one step at a time. So, from (7,4), moving up to (7,5) then left to (6,5), (5,5), (4,5): total 4 steps.\n\nTo (9,5): moving right to (8,4), then (9,4), then up to (9,5): 3 steps.\n\nHmm, that's closer. But wait, is there any risk in moving right? The enemy is at (4,4), so moving right towards x=8,9 shouldn't be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be safer because it gets me away from the enemy's position. But let me think about what's around.\n\nAfter moving right to (8,4), I'm at (8,4) next. Then, I can go to (9,4) and then up to (9,5) for the apple. But I should check if (9,5) is an apple. Yes, it is. So, that could be a plan.\n\nBut wait, in the board state provided, at row 5, the columns are 0,4,5, etc. So, (9,5) is indeed an apple.\n\nSo, moving to the right towards (9,5) in three steps is possible. Alternatively, moving up to (7,5) and then left to (4,5) would be four steps.\n\nBut which path is safer? Since the enemy is at (4,4), moving towards the right seems to avoid any potential conflicts, as the enemy is on the left side.\n\nAnother consideration is that moving right might put me near the edge of the board at x=9, but that's within bounds, so no problem.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up, I can go towards the apple at (1,7), which is much further away, but perhaps I can get there eventually.\n\nWait, but I don't need to decide the entire path right now; I just need to decide the next move. So, the options are up, down, left, or right.\n\nIf I move up, I go to (7,5), which is safe because there's nothing there except perhaps an apple at (4,5), but I'm not there yet.\n\nIf I move right, I go to (8,4), which is also safe because the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm moving away.\n\nIf I move left, I go to (6,4), which is towards the enemy, but it's still two units away, so that's probably safe now.\n\nIf I move down, I go to (7,3), which is empty as far as I can tell.\n\nSo, which direction is better?\n\nI think moving right to (8,4) makes sense because it gets me closer to the apple at (9,5). Alternatively, moving up to (7,5) starts me on the path to (4,5).\n\nBut I also have to think about the enemy. If the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm at (7,4), if I move left, I'm getting closer to the enemy, but moving right or up moves me away. So, to avoid potential conflict, moving away from the enemy might be safer.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (8,4) seems like a good option. Then, in the next moves, I can move right again to (9,4) and then up to (9,5) to eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving up might be better because it gets me closer to the apple at (4,5), but I have to make sure that path is clear.\n\nWait, perhaps moving left to (6,4) is also an option, but that's towards the enemy. But since the enemy is at (4,4), moving left to (6,4), then (5,4), then I can decide to go up to avoid the enemy.\n\nBut that might be more complicated. I think moving right to (8,4) is safer because I'm not approaching the enemy.\n\nSo, I think I'll choose to move right next.\n</think>\n\nTo get closer to the apple at (9,5) and avoid potential conflict with the enemy at (4,4), I'll move right to (8,4).\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

No, because moving RIGHT increases x, so from 9 to 10, which is outside. So perhaps I miswrote the last move.

Alternatively, maybe the snake can't move RIGHT from (9,4) because it's blocked by the wall, so it somehow stayed put? Or maybe the enemy is blocking.\n\nWait, looking at the board state, in row 4, at (5,4) there's an apple, and at (9,4) is my snake. Enemy snake #2 is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, in row 4, the positions are clear except for the apple at (5,4) and my position at (9,4). So moving LEFT from (9,4) would take me to (8,4), which is empty. So perhaps the last move was LEFT, not RIGHT. So maybe there was a mistake in the previous move.\n\nWait, the last move info says: \"Direction: RIGHT, Rationale: To move towards the apple at (9,5) and avoid the enemy at (4,4), I'll go right to (8,4).\" Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because moving RIGHT from (9,4) would take me to (10,4), which is a wall, causing me to die. So maybe the user made a mistake in the last move. So perhaps the correct move was LEFT to (8,4), because moving RIGHT from (9,4) is invalid.\n\nSo, now, after the last move, I'm at (8,4). What's the current state? Let me check the board again.\n\nThe apples are at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4). My snake is at (8,4). Enemy snake #2 is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, the enemy is in row 5, column 3 and 4. So, enemy is not blocking me in row 4.\n\nLooking at my position, (8,4), I need to decide the next move. The goal is to eat an apple to grow and gain points. So, which apple is closest?\n\nApples at (5,4) is in the same row, 3 units to the left. Apple at (9,5) is one unit up from my current position if I go to (8,5). Wait, (9,5) is at column 9, row 5. So from (8,4), moving up once would take me to (8,5), which is empty. Then moving RIGHT to (9,5) would get me the apple. So that's a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,4) is to the left, but that's 3 moves away. But moving towards (9,5) is closer. Also, since I'm at (8,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,4), which is my previous position, but that's not helpful. Wait, but (9,5) is an apple, so I could go up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) to eat it.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (5,4) is in the same row, so maybe I should go there first. But it's 3 moves to the left. However, moving towards (9,5) is only two moves: up then right.\n\nBut I should also be cautious about the enemy. The enemy snake is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, row 5, columns 3 and 4. So, if I move up to (8,5), I'm at column 8, which is far from the enemy. So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT to (7,4) to head towards (5,4) is better. But let's see which apple is closer.\n\nFrom (8,4):\n\n- To (5,4): distance is 3 (left 3 times).\n- To (9,5): distance is 2 (up once, then right once).\n\nSo, (9,5) is closer. So moving towards (9,5) seems better.\n\nBut wait, if I move up to (8,5), then right to (9,5), I can get the apple. But I need to check if any enemy is in the way. Since the enemy is at (3,5) and (4,5), they're to the left of (8,5), so no collision there.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) would let me eat the apple. Then I grow by one, gain a point, and my snake becomes longer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving to (7,4) first, but that seems less efficient.\n\nWait, is there any other apple closer? No, the other apples are at (0,5), (0,4), and (1,7), which are much farther.\n\nSo, plan is to move UP to (8,5), then RIGHT to (9,5) to get the apple.\n\nWait, but after moving up, I'll be at (8,5). Is that position safe? Let me check the board. At row 5, the enemy is at (3,5) and (4,5), so (8,5) is clear.\n\nSo, moving UP is safe. So next move should be UP.\n\nWait, but another thought: after moving to (8,5), I'm moving towards (9,5), which is an apple. But what if the enemy moves towards that area? But in this turn, it's my move first, so I can take the apple before the enemy does.\n\nAlso, considering that moving to (8,5) doesn't block me from other paths, seems safe.\n\nAnother consideration: if I go up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) to eat the apple, that's two moves. But I can only make one move now, so in this turn, I will move UP to (8,5), and in the next turn, move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nSo, I should decide to move UP now.\n\nWait, but the current position is (8,4). So moving UP would go to (8,5), which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, could I go RIGHT to (9,4), but that's moving back to where I was, which isn't helpful unless I'm trying to get to (9,5) from there. But from (9,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (10,4), which is a wall, so that's not possible. So from (8,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,4), which is okay, but then I'm back where I was, not moving towards the apple. So moving UP seems better.\n\nWait, from (8,4), moving RIGHT goes to (9,4), which is my previous position. But that's possible if I want to turn around. But moving UP seems more strategic towards the apple.\n\nSo, the decision is to move UP to (8,5), heading towards (9,5) to eat the apple.\n</think>\n\nNext, I will move UP to (8,5) to approach the apple at (9,5). This move is safe and brings me closer to an apple, allowing me to grow and gain a point.\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake #1 in this 10x10 board. My current position is at (9,6), and I just moved up to get here. Let me try to figure out my next move.\n\nFirst, let me recall the board state. The apples are at (0,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4), (7,4). So, the closest ones to me would probably be (5,4) and (7,4). But I need to check the positions of the other snake, Snake #2, which is at (1,5) with a body at (2,5). That's on the opposite side of the board, so maybe not a direct threat right now.\n\nMy last move was UP, which took me from (9,5) to (9,6). I was heading towards the apple at (9,5), but wait, no, looking back, the apples don't include (9,5). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me re-examine the apples: (0,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4), (7,4). So the only apple near me is if I go down to (9,5) or (9,4), but those don't have apples. Wait, looking back at the board state, I see that at (9,6) there's the snake head, and at (9,5) there's a 'T', but that might be an apple. Wait, no, the apples are listed as specific points, so perhaps the 'T's on the board are something else.\n\nWait, the board state is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again:\n\nRow 9: all dots except (9,9), I think. Wait, the coordinates increase upwards and to the right. So row 9 is the top, and column 9 is the rightmost. So looking at the board, each row is numbered from 9 downwards to 0. So at y=9, x=9 is the top right.\n\nWait, I think I might be getting the rows and columns mixed up. Let me clarify: the board is presented with row 9 at the top, and each row goes from x=0 to x=9. So the first line is y=9, then y=8, down to y=0. So when the snake is at (9,6), that's x=9, y=6, which would be on row 6, the furthest right column.\n\nLooking back at the board, at row 6 (which is the line starting with 6.), there's a dot at (6,9), and my snake is at (9,6), which is correct because my position is (9,6), so that's on row 6, column 9.\n\nThe apples are at:\n\n(0,5): x=0, y=5 \u2192 row 5, column 0.\n\n(0,4): row 4, column 0.\n\n(1,7): row 7, column 1.\n\n(5,4): row 4, column 5.\n\n(7,4): row 4, column7.\n\nSo, the closest apple to me is (5,4) and (7,4). Let me check the distance.\n\nI'm at (9,6). To reach (5,4), it's 4 steps left and 2 steps down. To reach (7,4), it's 2 steps left and 2 steps down.\n\nBut I need to see if the path is clear. However, moving towards (7,4) would be shorter, but I also have to avoid any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy snake #2 is at (1,5) with body at (2,5). That's on the left side, so maybe I don't have to worry about it right now.\n\nSo, I should plan a path towards the nearest apple. Since I'm at (9,6), moving left (decreasing x) would take me towards the center. But I should check the possible directions to see what's safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT, I'll go to (8,6). Is that safe? Let me check the board. At row 6, x=8 is a dot, so it's empty. Also, moving left is towards the apples at x=7,5, etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (9,6) would take me to (9,5), which on the board is labeled as 'A' and has a 'T' next to it, but according to the apple list, (9,5) isn't an apple. Wait, the apples are at (0,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4), (7,4). So (9,5) isn't an apple. Therefore, moving down to (9,5) might not be helpful unless there's an apple there that I'm missing. Wait, maybe I misread the board. Let me check the board description again.\n\nLooking at the board description, it says:\n\n5 A 2 T . . . . . . T\n\nSo at row 5, x=0 is A (apple), x=1 is 2 (snake #2), x=2 is T. Then from x=3 onwards, dots, until x=7 is A, x=8 is A, and x=9 is T.\n\nWait, no, the board's row 5 is:\n\nAt row 5 (y=5), the positions are:\n\nx=0: A (apple)\n\nx=1: 2 (snake head)\n\nx=2: T\n\nx=3: empty\n\nx=4: empty\n\nx=5: empty\n\nx=6: empty\n\nx=7: A (apple)\n\nx=8: A (apple)\n\nx=9: T.\n\nWait, so at x=9, y=5 is T, which I think stands for an apple that's taken or maybe an enemy's tail? Or perhaps it's just another symbol. But according to the apple positions given, only (0,5) is an apple, not (9,5). So my mistake earlier; moving down to (9,5) isn't helpful because there's no apple there.\n\nTherefore, my best bet is to move towards the apple at (7,4). Let me plan the path.\n\nFrom (9,6), I can move left to (8,6), then left to (7,6). From there, moving down to (7,5), then down again to (7,4), which is an apple.\n\nAlternatively, I can go down first to (9,5), but since there's no apple, that's not helpful. So moving left is better.\n\nLet me check if moving left is safe. The board shows at (8,6) is empty, and (7,6) is also empty. Then, moving down from (7,6) to (7,5), which is empty, and then to (7,4) for the apple.\n\nSo the next move should be LEFT to (8,6).\n\nWait, but maybe moving down first from (9,6) to (9,5) and then moving left? Let me see. (9,5) is a 'T', which I'm not sure what it is. Maybe it's the tail of another snake? If that's the case, moving there would cause me to collide with the tail, resulting in death. So I should avoid (9,5).\n\nTherefore, moving left is safer. So my next move is LEFT.\n\nBut wait, I just moved up to (9,6), so moving left from here is possible. Let me confirm that there are no other snakes or walls blocking me.\n\nThe board shows no other snakes near the right side except snake #2 on the left. So moving left is clear.\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nI'll move left to head towards the apple at (7,4). \n\nUP\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake, snake ID 1, is currently at (7,6). There are several apples on the board: at (1,7), (5,4), (7,4), (1,6), and (6,3). \n\nLooking at where I am now, (7,6), I want to get to the nearest apple. The apples are at different positions, so I should calculate the distance from my current position to each apple to decide which one is closest.\n\nLet's calculate the distances:\n\n1. Apple at (1,7): The distance here is the sum of the horizontal and vertical differences. So, |7-1| + |6-7| = 6 + 1 = 7 units.\n2. Apple at (5,4): |7-5| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4 units.\n3. Apple at (7,4): This is directly below me, same x-coordinate. So, |7-7| + |6-4| = 0 + 2 = 2 units.\n4. Apple at (1,6): |7-1| + |6-6| = 6 + 0 = 6 units.\n5. Apple at (6,3): |7-6| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4 units.\n\nFrom these calculations, the closest apple is at (7,4), just two units below my current position. So that's my target.\n\nNow, I need to figure out the best path to get there without hitting anything. My snake is moving on a grid, so each move changes either the x or y coordinate by 1. Since the apple is directly below me on the same x-coordinate (7), I can just move down twice.\n\nBut wait, there's an enemy snake, snake ID 2, positioned at (0,4) with its body at [(0,5), (1,5), (2,5)]. I should check if moving down will cause me to collide with any part of this snake's body.\n\nLooking at snake 2's positions: it's at (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,5). None of these are on the same x-coordinate as me (7) or in the path I need to take. So, moving down from (7,6) to (7,5) and then to (7,4) shouldn't be a problem.\n\nBut let me double-check the board state provided. The board shows that at y=6, x=7, my snake's head is at (7,6). Below that, at y=5, x=7, it's empty. Similarly, at y=4, x=7, there's an apple. So, the path is clear.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving down, will I hit myself? My snake's body is moving forward, so as long as I don't make a U-turn into my own body, I should be fine. Since I'm moving down and my body is following, it shouldn't be an issue.\n\nWait, actually, my last move was LEFT, which was to get to (7,6) from maybe (8,6) or something? Hmm, I'm not sure about the previous positions of my body. But since the last move was LEFT and I'm now at (7,6), moving down should be okay as long as my body doesn't obscure that path. Since the board shows only my head at (7,6), I can assume the body is behind, so moving down is safe.\n\nSo, the plan is to move down once to (7,5), then again to (7,4) to eat the apple. But I need to decide the next single move. So the first step is to move down from (7,6) to (7,5). \n\nDo I have any other immediate threats or considerations? Let me check the other apples. The next closest after (7,4) is (5,4) and (6,3), both 4 units away. But since (7,4) is just two moves away, it's better to go for that first.\n\nAnother point to consider: growing by eating the apple will make my snake longer, which is good for blocking enemies and having more points. So it's beneficial to get it.\n\nPotential alternative: What if I decide to go for the apple at (5,4) instead? Let's see, from (7,6) to (5,4), I need to move left two times and down two times. That's four moves. Whereas (7,4) is just two moves. So it's more efficient to go for (7,4).\n\nAlso, I should check if there's any enemy nearby that could interfere. Snake 2 is at (0,4), which is far from my current position, so it won't block my path to (7,4).\n\nTherefore, the best move is to go DOWN to reach the apple at (7,4).\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (7,4), I'll move down from (7,6). This path is clear of obstacles and enemy snakes.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (7,4), which is on the x=7 line, y=4. The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, I'm somewhere in the middle right area of the board.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are several: at (0,5), (9,5), (4,5), (0,4), and (1,7). So, one is at (0,4) which is right at the bottom left corner, one at (1,7) which is a bit up on the left, and others are spread across the middle and right.\n\nThe enemy snake, Snake #2, is at (4,4) with an empty body, which probably means it's just the head. My snake is at (7,4), so we're both on the same y level, but on different x coordinates.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. The rules say that moving into an apple makes me grow and gain a point. If I hit a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nSo, my first thought is to look for the nearest apple. The apples are at (0,5), (9,5), (4,5), (0,4), and (1,7). My current position is (7,4). Let me calculate the distances.\n\nFrom (7,4) to (0,4): that's a distance of 7 units to the left. To (0,5): diagonal up and left, so longer. To (9,5): that's moving right to x=9, which is 2 units to the right and up 1, but that's quite far. To (4,5): that's left 3 units and up 1. To (1,7): left 6 units and up 3.\n\nBut let's see, the closest apples would be the ones at (4,5) and (1,7). Alternatively, maybe there's an apple at (0,4), but that's 7 units left. However, looking at the board state, I see that at (4,5), there's an apple, and also at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), and (1,7). Wait, but the current position is (7,4), so the apple at (4,5) is 3 units to the left and 1 unit up. Alternatively, the apple at (1,7) is 6 units left and 3 up.\n\nWait, let me visualize the board again. My snake is at (7,4). Let me look at the board rows. Row 4 is where my snake is, at x=7. So, moving up in y is towards higher y values.\n\nLooking for the nearest apple, perhaps the apple at (4,5) is closer. To get there, I need to move left to x=4 and up to y=5. That would require moving left 3 times and then up once, but each move is one step. Alternatively, moving up first to y=5 and then left to x=4. But I need to make sure that I don't run into anything.\n\nWait, but Snake #2 is at (4,4). So, if I move left to (6,4), then to (5,4), (4,4), I would run into Snake #2, which would cause me to die. So, that's a problem. So, moving left directly might not be safe. Alternatively, I could move up first.\n\nFrom (7,4), if I move up to (7,5), that's a safe move because there's nothing there. Then, I can move left to (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), which is an apple. So that seems like a plan. But wait, is (7,5) free? Let me check the apples. Yes, the apples are at (0,5), (4,5), etc. But on the board state, at y=5, x=4 is an apple, so yes, moving to (4,5) is safe, but getting there requires moving through (7,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right to (8,4), (9,4), but I don't see an apple there. The apples are at (9,5), which would require moving up after moving right. But that's two steps away: right to (8,4), then right to (9,4), then up to (9,5). But I don't know if there's a snake or wall in the way, but since it's within the 0-9 range, no walls.\n\nWait, but if I move right to x=8, then x=9, then up to (9,5), that's two moves. But I need to check if there's anything blocking. The only enemy is at (4,4), so that's not in the way. So, that's a possibility.\n\nWait, but the apple at (4,5) is closer in terms of steps. Let me map it out:\n\nOption 1: Move UP to (7,5), then LEFT three times to (4,5).\n\nThat's four moves: up, left, left, left.\n\nBut each turn, I can only move once. So, perhaps in the next move, I should go up.\n\nOption 2: Move RIGHT to (8,4), then to (9,4), then up to (9,5). That's three moves.\n\nBut wait, I have to think about what to do next. But the question is, what's my next move, so I need to decide whether to go up, right, down, or left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left to (6,4) but that's towards the enemy at (4,4), so I can't go that way because I might run into the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (4,4), so if I move left, I go towards x=7-1=6, which is still safe, but moving further left would approach (4,4). So, if I move left now, I would be at (6,4). Then, the next move, I could go left again to (5,4), then perhaps up or something. But I need to avoid (4,4).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving up first is safer because it gets me away from the enemy.\n\nSo, if I move up to (7,5), that's a safe move. Then, next move, I can go left to (6,5), then left again to (5,5), then left to (4,5) where the apple is. That would take three more moves after moving up.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (8,4) now, and then up to (8,5), then to (9,5) for the apple there. But that apple is further away.\n\nSo, which apple is closer? The one at (4,5) is 3 left and 1 up, total of 4 steps. The one at (9,5) is 2 right and 1 up, 3 steps. Wait, actually, from (7,4):\n\nTo (4,5): moving left 3 and up 1, but that's a diagonal, but in terms of steps, you have to move each direction one step at a time. So, from (7,4), moving up to (7,5) then left to (6,5), (5,5), (4,5): total 4 steps.\n\nTo (9,5): moving right to (8,4), then (9,4), then up to (9,5): 3 steps.\n\nHmm, that's closer. But wait, is there any risk in moving right? The enemy is at (4,4), so moving right towards x=8,9 shouldn't be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be safer because it gets me away from the enemy's position. But let me think about what's around.\n\nAfter moving right to (8,4), I'm at (8,4) next. Then, I can go to (9,4) and then up to (9,5) for the apple. But I should check if (9,5) is an apple. Yes, it is. So, that could be a plan.\n\nBut wait, in the board state provided, at row 5, the columns are 0,4,5, etc. So, (9,5) is indeed an apple.\n\nSo, moving to the right towards (9,5) in three steps is possible. Alternatively, moving up to (7,5) and then left to (4,5) would be four steps.\n\nBut which path is safer? Since the enemy is at (4,4), moving towards the right seems to avoid any potential conflicts, as the enemy is on the left side.\n\nAnother consideration is that moving right might put me near the edge of the board at x=9, but that's within bounds, so no problem.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up, I can go towards the apple at (1,7), which is much further away, but perhaps I can get there eventually.\n\nWait, but I don't need to decide the entire path right now; I just need to decide the next move. So, the options are up, down, left, or right.\n\nIf I move up, I go to (7,5), which is safe because there's nothing there except perhaps an apple at (4,5), but I'm not there yet.\n\nIf I move right, I go to (8,4), which is also safe because the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm moving away.\n\nIf I move left, I go to (6,4), which is towards the enemy, but it's still two units away, so that's probably safe now.\n\nIf I move down, I go to (7,3), which is empty as far as I can tell.\n\nSo, which direction is better?\n\nI think moving right to (8,4) makes sense because it gets me closer to the apple at (9,5). Alternatively, moving up to (7,5) starts me on the path to (4,5).\n\nBut I also have to think about the enemy. If the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm at (7,4), if I move left, I'm getting closer to the enemy, but moving right or up moves me away. So, to avoid potential conflict, moving away from the enemy might be safer.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (8,4) seems like a good option. Then, in the next moves, I can move right again to (9,4) and then up to (9,5) to eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving up might be better because it gets me closer to the apple at (4,5), but I have to make sure that path is clear.\n\nWait, perhaps moving left to (6,4) is also an option, but that's towards the enemy. But since the enemy is at (4,4), moving left to (6,4), then (5,4), then I can decide to go up to avoid the enemy.\n\nBut that might be more complicated. I think moving right to (8,4) is safer because I'm not approaching the enemy.\n\nSo, I think I'll choose to move right next.\n</think>\n\nTo get closer to the apple at (9,5) and avoid potential conflict with the enemy at (4,4), I'll move right to (8,4).\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm controlling snake ID 1, which is currently at (9,4). The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, my snake is at the far right side, somewhere in the middle vertically.\n\nApples are located at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), (1,7), and (5,4). My next move was RIGHT, which I decided last turn to move towards the apple at (9,5) and avoid the enemy at (4,4). So I went from (9,4) to (8,4). Wait, no, moving RIGHT would increase the x-coordinate, so from (9,4) moving RIGHT would take me to (10,4), which is outside the board. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake last time. Because moving RIGHT from (9,4) would go to (10,4), which is a wall, so that would cause me to die. Oh no, that's bad. So maybe I should reconsider.\n\nWait, no, in the previous move, I was at (9,4) and the last move was RIGHT, so that would have taken me to (8,4)? No, because moving RIGHT increases x, so from 9 to 10, which is outside. So perhaps I miswrote the last move. Or perhaps the snake can't move right from (9,4) because it's at the edge.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's last move information says they moved RIGHT to (8,4). But wait, from (9,4), moving RIGHT would take you to (10,4), which is a wall. So maybe there's a confusion here. Perhaps they meant to move LEFT to (8,4). Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the coordinates work.\n\nWait, the user's last move was RIGHT, leading to (8,4). So maybe the snake moved from (9,4) to (8,4) by going LEFT? Because moving RIGHT from x=9 would go beyond the board. So perhaps that's a mistake in the last move. Alternatively, maybe the snake can't move RIGHT from (9,4) because it's blocked by the wall, so it somehow stayed put? Or maybe the enemy is blocking.\n\nWait, looking at the board state, in row 4, at (5,4) there's an apple, and at (9,4) is my snake. Enemy snake #2 is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, in row 4, the positions are clear except for the apple at (5,4) and my position at (9,4). So moving LEFT from (9,4) would take me to (8,4), which is empty. So perhaps the last move was LEFT, not RIGHT. So maybe there was a mistake in the previous move.\n\nWait, the last move info says: \"Direction: RIGHT, Rationale: To move towards the apple at (9,5) and avoid the enemy at (4,4), I'll go right to (8,4).\" Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because moving RIGHT from (9,4) would take me to (10,4), which is a wall, causing me to die. So maybe the user made a mistake in the last move. So perhaps the correct move was LEFT to (8,4), because moving RIGHT from (9,4) is invalid.\n\nSo, now, after the last move, I'm at (8,4). What's the current state? Let me check the board again.\n\nThe apples are at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4). My snake is at (8,4). Enemy snake #2 is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, the enemy is in row 5, column 3 and 4. So, enemy is not blocking me in row 4.\n\nLooking at my position, (8,4), I need to decide the next move. The goal is to eat an apple to grow and gain points. So, which apple is closest?\n\nApples at (5,4) is in the same row, 3 units to the left. Apple at (9,5) is one unit up from my current position if I go to (8,5). Wait, (9,5) is at column 9, row 5. So from (8,4), moving up once would take me to (8,5), which is empty. Then moving RIGHT to (9,5) would get me the apple. So that's a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,4) is to the left, but that's 3 moves away. But moving towards (9,5) is closer. Also, since I'm at (8,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,4), which is my previous position, but that's not helpful. Wait, but (9,5) is an apple, so I could go up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) to eat it.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (5,4) is in the same row, so maybe I should go there first. But it's 3 moves to the left. However, moving towards (9,5) is only two moves: up then right.\n\nBut I should also be cautious about the enemy. The enemy snake is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, row 5, columns 3 and 4. So, if I move up to (8,5), I'm at column 8, which is far from the enemy. So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT to (7,4) to head towards (5,4) is better. But let's see which apple is closer.\n\nFrom (8,4):\n\n- To (5,4): distance is 3 (left 3 times).\n- To (9,5): distance is 2 (up once, then right once).\n\nSo, (9,5) is closer. So moving towards (9,5) seems better.\n\nBut wait, if I move up to (8,5), then right to (9,5), I can get the apple. But I need to check if any enemy is in the way. Since the enemy is at (3,5) and (4,5), they're to the left of (8,5), so no collision there.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) would let me eat the apple. Then I grow by one, gain a point, and my snake becomes longer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving to (7,4) first, but that seems less efficient.\n\nWait, is there any other apple closer? No, the other apples are at (0,5), (0,4), and (1,7), which are much farther.\n\nSo, plan is to move UP to (8,5), then RIGHT to (9,5) to get the apple.\n\nWait, but after moving up, I'll be at (8,5). Is that position safe? Let me check the board. At row 5, the enemy is at (3,5) and (4,5), so (8,5) is clear.\n\nSo, moving UP is safe. So next move should be UP.\n\nWait, but another thought: after moving to (8,5), I'm moving towards (9,5), which is an apple. But what if the enemy moves towards that area? But in this turn, it's my move first, so I can take the apple before the enemy does.\n\nAlso, considering that moving to (8,5) doesn't block me from other paths, seems safe.\n\nAnother consideration: if I go up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) to eat the apple, that's two moves. But I can only make one move now, so in this turn, I will move UP to (8,5), and in the next turn, move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nSo, I should decide to move UP now.\n\nWait, but the current position is (8,4). So moving UP would go to (8,5), which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, could I go RIGHT to (9,4), but that's moving back to where I was, which isn't helpful unless I'm trying to get to (9,5) from there. But from (9,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (10,4), which is a wall, so that's not possible. So from (8,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,4), which is okay, but then I'm back where I was, not moving towards the apple. So moving UP seems better.\n\nWait, from (8,4), moving RIGHT goes to (9,4), which is my previous position. But that's possible if I want to turn around. But moving UP seems more strategic towards the apple.\n\nSo, the decision is to move UP to (8,5), heading towards (9,5) to eat the apple.\n</think>\n\nNext, I will move UP to (8,5) to approach the apple at (9,5). This move is safe and brings me closer to an apple, allowing me to grow and gain a point.\n\nUP"

The first step in that direction is to move LEFT.\n\n### Next Turn Strategy:\n- After moving LEFT, continue moving LEFT until reaching the apple at (0, 5).\n- Once the apple is picked up, reassess the board and move towards the next closest apple while avoiding the enemy snake and walls.\n\n### Next Move:\nLEFT\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake #1 in this 10x10 board. My current position is at (9,6), and I just moved up to get here. Let me try to figure out my next move.\n\nFirst, let me recall the board state. The apples are at (0,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4), (7,4). So, the closest ones to me would probably be (5,4) and (7,4). But I need to check the positions of the other snake, Snake #2, which is at (1,5) with a body at (2,5). That's on the opposite side of the board, so maybe not a direct threat right now.\n\nMy last move was UP, which took me from (9,5) to (9,6). I was heading towards the apple at (9,5), but wait, no, looking back, the apples don't include (9,5). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me re-examine the apples: (0,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4), (7,4). So the only apple near me is if I go down to (9,5) or (9,4), but those don't have apples. Wait, looking back at the board state, I see that at (9,6) there's the snake head, and at (9,5) there's a 'T', but that might be an apple. Wait, no, the apples are listed as specific points, so perhaps the 'T's on the board are something else.\n\nWait, the board state is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again:\n\nRow 9: all dots except (9,9), I think. Wait, the coordinates increase upwards and to the right. So row 9 is the top, and column 9 is the rightmost. So looking at the board, each row is numbered from 9 downwards to 0. So at y=9, x=9 is the top right.\n\nWait, I think I might be getting the rows and columns mixed up. Let me clarify: the board is presented with row 9 at the top, and each row goes from x=0 to x=9. So the first line is y=9, then y=8, down to y=0. So when the snake is at (9,6), that's x=9, y=6, which would be on row 6, the furthest right column.\n\nLooking back at the board, at row 6 (which is the line starting with 6.), there's a dot at (6,9), and my snake is at (9,6), which is correct because my position is (9,6), so that's on row 6, column 9.\n\nThe apples are at:\n\n(0,5): x=0, y=5 \u2192 row 5, column 0.\n\n(0,4): row 4, column 0.\n\n(1,7): row 7, column 1.\n\n(5,4): row 4, column 5.\n\n(7,4): row 4, column7.\n\nSo, the closest apple to me is (5,4) and (7,4). Let me check the distance.\n\nI'm at (9,6). To reach (5,4), it's 4 steps left and 2 steps down. To reach (7,4), it's 2 steps left and 2 steps down.\n\nBut I need to see if the path is clear. However, moving towards (7,4) would be shorter, but I also have to avoid any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy snake #2 is at (1,5) with body at (2,5). That's on the left side, so maybe I don't have to worry about it right now.\n\nSo, I should plan a path towards the nearest apple. Since I'm at (9,6), moving left (decreasing x) would take me towards the center. But I should check the possible directions to see what's safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT, I'll go to (8,6). Is that safe? Let me check the board. At row 6, x=8 is a dot, so it's empty. Also, moving left is towards the apples at x=7,5, etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (9,6) would take me to (9,5), which on the board is labeled as 'A' and has a 'T' next to it, but according to the apple list, (9,5) isn't an apple. Wait, the apples are at (0,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4), (7,4). So (9,5) isn't an apple. Therefore, moving down to (9,5) might not be helpful unless there's an apple there that I'm missing. Wait, maybe I misread the board. Let me check the board description again.\n\nLooking at the board description, it says:\n\n5 A 2 T . . . . . . T\n\nSo at row 5, x=0 is A (apple), x=1 is 2 (snake #2), x=2 is T. Then from x=3 onwards, dots, until x=7 is A, x=8 is A, and x=9 is T.\n\nWait, no, the board's row 5 is:\n\nAt row 5 (y=5), the positions are:\n\nx=0: A (apple)\n\nx=1: 2 (snake head)\n\nx=2: T\n\nx=3: empty\n\nx=4: empty\n\nx=5: empty\n\nx=6: empty\n\nx=7: A (apple)\n\nx=8: A (apple)\n\nx=9: T.\n\nWait, so at x=9, y=5 is T, which I think stands for an apple that's taken or maybe an enemy's tail? Or perhaps it's just another symbol. But according to the apple positions given, only (0,5) is an apple, not (9,5). So my mistake earlier; moving down to (9,5) isn't helpful because there's no apple there.\n\nTherefore, my best bet is to move towards the apple at (7,4). Let me plan the path.\n\nFrom (9,6), I can move left to (8,6), then left to (7,6). From there, moving down to (7,5), then down again to (7,4), which is an apple.\n\nAlternatively, I can go down first to (9,5), but since there's no apple, that's not helpful. So moving left is better.\n\nLet me check if moving left is safe. The board shows at (8,6) is empty, and (7,6) is also empty. Then, moving down from (7,6) to (7,5), which is empty, and then to (7,4) for the apple.\n\nSo the next move should be LEFT to (8,6).\n\nWait, but maybe moving down first from (9,6) to (9,5) and then moving left? Let me see. (9,5) is a 'T', which I'm not sure what it is. Maybe it's the tail of another snake? If that's the case, moving there would cause me to collide with the tail, resulting in death. So I should avoid (9,5).\n\nTherefore, moving left is safer. So my next move is LEFT.\n\nBut wait, I just moved up to (9,6), so moving left from here is possible. Let me confirm that there are no other snakes or walls blocking me.\n\nThe board shows no other snakes near the right side except snake #2 on the left. So moving left is clear.\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nI'll move left to head towards the apple at (7,4). \n\nUP\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake, snake ID 1, is currently at (7,6). There are several apples on the board: at (1,7), (5,4), (7,4), (1,6), and (6,3). \n\nLooking at where I am now, (7,6), I want to get to the nearest apple. The apples are at different positions, so I should calculate the distance from my current position to each apple to decide which one is closest.\n\nLet's calculate the distances:\n\n1. Apple at (1,7): The distance here is the sum of the horizontal and vertical differences. So, |7-1| + |6-7| = 6 + 1 = 7 units.\n2. Apple at (5,4): |7-5| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4 units.\n3. Apple at (7,4): This is directly below me, same x-coordinate. So, |7-7| + |6-4| = 0 + 2 = 2 units.\n4. Apple at (1,6): |7-1| + |6-6| = 6 + 0 = 6 units.\n5. Apple at (6,3): |7-6| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4 units.\n\nFrom these calculations, the closest apple is at (7,4), just two units below my current position. So that's my target.\n\nNow, I need to figure out the best path to get there without hitting anything. My snake is moving on a grid, so each move changes either the x or y coordinate by 1. Since the apple is directly below me on the same x-coordinate (7), I can just move down twice.\n\nBut wait, there's an enemy snake, snake ID 2, positioned at (0,4) with its body at [(0,5), (1,5), (2,5)]. I should check if moving down will cause me to collide with any part of this snake's body.\n\nLooking at snake 2's positions: it's at (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,5). None of these are on the same x-coordinate as me (7) or in the path I need to take. So, moving down from (7,6) to (7,5) and then to (7,4) shouldn't be a problem.\n\nBut let me double-check the board state provided. The board shows that at y=6, x=7, my snake's head is at (7,6). Below that, at y=5, x=7, it's empty. Similarly, at y=4, x=7, there's an apple. So, the path is clear.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving down, will I hit myself? My snake's body is moving forward, so as long as I don't make a U-turn into my own body, I should be fine. Since I'm moving down and my body is following, it shouldn't be an issue.\n\nWait, actually, my last move was LEFT, which was to get to (7,6) from maybe (8,6) or something? Hmm, I'm not sure about the previous positions of my body. But since the last move was LEFT and I'm now at (7,6), moving down should be okay as long as my body doesn't obscure that path. Since the board shows only my head at (7,6), I can assume the body is behind, so moving down is safe.\n\nSo, the plan is to move down once to (7,5), then again to (7,4) to eat the apple. But I need to decide the next single move. So the first step is to move down from (7,6) to (7,5). \n\nDo I have any other immediate threats or considerations? Let me check the other apples. The next closest after (7,4) is (5,4) and (6,3), both 4 units away. But since (7,4) is just two moves away, it's better to go for that first.\n\nAnother point to consider: growing by eating the apple will make my snake longer, which is good for blocking enemies and having more points. So it's beneficial to get it.\n\nPotential alternative: What if I decide to go for the apple at (5,4) instead? Let's see, from (7,6) to (5,4), I need to move left two times and down two times. That's four moves. Whereas (7,4) is just two moves. So it's more efficient to go for (7,4).\n\nAlso, I should check if there's any enemy nearby that could interfere. Snake 2 is at (0,4), which is far from my current position, so it won't block my path to (7,4).\n\nTherefore, the best move is to go DOWN to reach the apple at (7,4).\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (7,4), I'll move down from (7,6). This path is clear of obstacles and enemy snakes.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm controlling snake number 1, which is currently at (7,4). The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My last move was DOWN, which I think was intended to go towards an apple at (7,4), but wait, that's where I already am. Hmm, maybe that's a mistake.\n\nLooking at the apples, they're at (1,7), (5,4), (1,6), (6,3), and (4,4). My position is (7,4). So, the closest apple would be at (5,4) or (6,3). Wait, (5,4) is two steps left on the same y-level, and (6,3) is one step left and one step down. Alternatively, (4,4) is three steps left. Wait, no, the apple at (4,4) is three steps left from me, but actually, in the current board state, I'm at (7,4), so moving left would decrease x. So, (5,4) is x=5, which is two steps left from me. (4,4) is three steps left.\n\nLooking at the board, there's another snake, snake number 2, whose head is at (2,4) and its body is at [(1,4), (0,4), (0,5)]. Wait, so snake 2 is moving along the x=0 to x=2, y=4 and y=5. So, its body is from (1,4) to (0,4), and then up to (0,5). So, that's in the lower left part of the board, while I'm at (7,4), which is more to the right.\n\nI need to decide my next move. Since I was just moving DOWN, maybe that's not the right direction because moving down from (7,4) would take me to y=3. Is there an apple there? Let's see: apples at y=3 is (6,3). So, that's two steps left and one step down, but moving to (7,3) wouldn't get me there. Alternatively, perhaps I should move towards (5,4) or (6,3).\n\nWait, let me check the board again. The apples: (1,7), (5,4), (1,6), (6,3), (4,4). So, (5,4) is at x=5, y=4, which is two steps left of my current position. That's possible. Alternatively, (6,3) is at x=6, y=3, which is one step left and one down from me.\n\nBut wait, in my last move, I went DOWN from maybe (7,5) to (7,4), perhaps? Because the previous move was DOWN, so my next move was to (7,4). Now, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at possible directions:\n\n- UP: Would take me to (7,5). Is there an apple there? No, the apples are at lower y's except for (1,7) and (1,6). So UP might not be useful unless I'm trying to get away from something.\n\n- DOWN: To (7,3). Is there an apple there? No, the nearest apple is at (6,3), which is left one and down one.\n\n- LEFT: To (6,4). That's moving towards (5,4), which is an apple. So that's a possible direction.\n\n- RIGHT: To (8,4). But that's moving away from the apples, so probably not useful.\n\nSo, considering that, moving LEFT would take me closer to the apple at (5,4). But I need to check if that's safe. Are there any obstacles or enemies in that path?\n\nSnake #2 is at (2,4) with body at (1,4), (0,4), (0,5). So, snake #2's body is along x=0, y=4, and (1,4). So, at x=2, y=4 is the head. So, moving to (6,4) would be safe from snake #2, since snake #2 is far to the left.\n\nWhat about my own body? Wait, since I'm just a single segment right now, I don't have a body to worry about. So, moving left to (6,4) is possible.\n\nAlternatively, could I move DOWN to (7,3) and then LEFT to (6,3) to reach the apple at (6,3)? That might be a better option because (6,3) is closer than (5,4). Let's check the distance: moving left twice would take two steps to reach (5,4). Moving down once and left once would take two steps to reach (6,3). So, both options are two steps away, but (6,3) is diagonally closer.\n\nWait, but moving to (6,3) would require moving DOWN and then LEFT, but in the next move, I can only choose one direction. So, in the next move, if I choose DOWN, I'd go to (7,3), which is one step towards (6,3). Then, from there, I can move LEFT to (6,3) in the next move. Alternatively, if I move LEFT now to (6,4), and then down in the next move to (6,3), that would also take two moves.\n\nSo, both options take two steps. Alternatively, perhaps I should head towards (5,4) because it's on the same y-level, so maybe that's a straight line.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (4,4) as well, which is three steps left from me. So, if I go LEFT three times, I can reach (4,4). But that might take longer, and perhaps another snake could interfere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize getting an apple quickly. Since (5,4) is two moves away, and (6,3) is two moves away, but perhaps (5,4) is safer because it's on the same y-level and maybe there's less chance of collision.\n\nWait, let me check what's around me. Are there any walls or other snakes nearby? My position is (7,4). To the right, there's (8,4), which seems empty. To the left, (6,4) is empty, I think. From the board state, in row 4, positions at x=4,5,6,7 are T, T, A, A, and me at (7,4). So, (5,4) is an apple, (4,4) is another apple, but (6,4) is an apple as well? Wait no, looking back, the apples are at (1,7), (5,4), (1,6), (6,3), (4,4). So, in row 4, y=4, the apples are at x=5 and x=4. So, (5,4) and (4,4) are apples. But in my current position, (7,4), moving left to (6,4) would take me to x=6, y=4, which is empty, but the apple is at (5,4). So, moving left twice would get me there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,3) and then LEFT to (6,3) is another path. But (6,3) is an apple as well.\n\nSo, which path is better? Let me think about the possible dangers.\n\nSnake #2 is at (2,4), and its body is along x=0-2, y=4 and y=5. So, if I move towards (5,4), I'm moving left from (7,4) to (6,4) and then (5,4). Is there any chance of collision with snake #2? No, because snake #2 is at x=2, y=4, which is far to the left. So, moving towards (5,4) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (6,3) would require going down to (7,3) and then left to (6,3). That also seems safe because there's no snake in that area.\n\nBut perhaps moving towards (5,4) is better because it's on the same y-level, and I can get there without changing direction, while moving towards (6,3) would require a direction change in the next move.\n\nAlternatively, think about which apple is more accessible without competition. If snake #2 is on the left side, maybe the apples on the right are less contested.\n\nWait, but what about other snakes? Only snake #2 is mentioned. So, it's just me and snake #2.\n\nI think the best move is to go towards the closer apple, which would be either (5,4) or (6,3). Both are two steps away. But perhaps (5,4) is better because it's on the same level, so I can keep moving left without changing direction, which might be safer.\n\nWait, but in the current setup, (7,4) is on the far right of the board. So, moving left to (6,4) is possible, and then to (5,4) to get the apple. That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (7,3) to get towards (6,3) might also be a good idea. Let me see which apple is closer in terms of steps. Both require two moves, so it's a tie.\n\nBut perhaps (6,3) is better because it's closer in terms of Euclidean distance. Let me calculate: from (7,4) to (5,4) is 2 steps left. From (7,4) to (6,3) is 1 left and 1 down, total 2 steps as well. So, same number of steps. So, perhaps I can choose either.\n\nWait, let me check if moving down from (7,4) to (7,3) is safe. Are there any obstacles or other snakes? The board shows that at y=3, x=6 is an apple, so it's safe. So, moving down is possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (6,4) is safe as well.\n\nSo, perhaps I should choose the direction that leads me closer to an apple without any risk. Both options seem safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go towards (6,3) because it's an apple that's not aligned with other snakes. Let me choose to move down to (7,3), then next move left to (6,3) to eat the apple.\n\nWait, but in the next move, I can only move once. So, in the current turn, I need to decide which direction to go. If I move DOWN now, I can then move LEFT in the next turn to reach the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now would lead me to (6,4), and then in the next move, I can move left again to (5,4) to get the apple.\n\nSo, both options are viable. Maybe I should choose the path that's less likely to be contested. Since snake #2 is on the left, maybe going towards (6,3) is better because it's further right and less likely for snake #2 to reach it before me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (5,4) is better because it's closer to me in x direction. I'm at x=7, so two left moves would take me to (5,4).\n\nI think I'll choose to move LEFT to (6,4), then in the next move, move left again to (5,4) to eat that apple.\n\nSo, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is LEFT to head towards the apple at (5,4). This direction is chosen to move closer to an apple while avoiding potential collisions with other snakes or walls.\n\n**Move:** LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (7,4), which is on the x=7 line, y=4. The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. So, I'm somewhere in the middle right area of the board.\n\nLooking at the apples, there are several: at (0,5), (9,5), (4,5), (0,4), and (1,7). So, one is at (0,4) which is right at the bottom left corner, one at (1,7) which is a bit up on the left, and others are spread across the middle and right.\n\nThe enemy snake, Snake #2, is at (4,4) with an empty body, which probably means it's just the head. My snake is at (7,4), so we're both on the same y level, but on different x coordinates.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. The rules say that moving into an apple makes me grow and gain a point. If I hit a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n\nSo, my first thought is to look for the nearest apple. The apples are at (0,5), (9,5), (4,5), (0,4), and (1,7). My current position is (7,4). Let me calculate the distances.\n\nFrom (7,4) to (0,4): that's a distance of 7 units to the left. To (0,5): diagonal up and left, so longer. To (9,5): that's moving right to x=9, which is 2 units to the right and up 1, but that's quite far. To (4,5): that's left 3 units and up 1. To (1,7): left 6 units and up 3.\n\nBut let's see, the closest apples would be the ones at (4,5) and (1,7). Alternatively, maybe there's an apple at (0,4), but that's 7 units left. However, looking at the board state, I see that at (4,5), there's an apple, and also at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), and (1,7). Wait, but the current position is (7,4), so the apple at (4,5) is 3 units to the left and 1 unit up. Alternatively, the apple at (1,7) is 6 units left and 3 up.\n\nWait, let me visualize the board again. My snake is at (7,4). Let me look at the board rows. Row 4 is where my snake is, at x=7. So, moving up in y is towards higher y values.\n\nLooking for the nearest apple, perhaps the apple at (4,5) is closer. To get there, I need to move left to x=4 and up to y=5. That would require moving left 3 times and then up once, but each move is one step. Alternatively, moving up first to y=5 and then left to x=4. But I need to make sure that I don't run into anything.\n\nWait, but Snake #2 is at (4,4). So, if I move left to (6,4), then to (5,4), (4,4), I would run into Snake #2, which would cause me to die. So, that's a problem. So, moving left directly might not be safe. Alternatively, I could move up first.\n\nFrom (7,4), if I move up to (7,5), that's a safe move because there's nothing there. Then, I can move left to (6,5), (5,5), (4,5), which is an apple. So that seems like a plan. But wait, is (7,5) free? Let me check the apples. Yes, the apples are at (0,5), (4,5), etc. But on the board state, at y=5, x=4 is an apple, so yes, moving to (4,5) is safe, but getting there requires moving through (7,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving right to (8,4), (9,4), but I don't see an apple there. The apples are at (9,5), which would require moving up after moving right. But that's two steps away: right to (8,4), then right to (9,4), then up to (9,5). But I don't know if there's a snake or wall in the way, but since it's within the 0-9 range, no walls.\n\nWait, but if I move right to x=8, then x=9, then up to (9,5), that's two moves. But I need to check if there's anything blocking. The only enemy is at (4,4), so that's not in the way. So, that's a possibility.\n\nWait, but the apple at (4,5) is closer in terms of steps. Let me map it out:\n\nOption 1: Move UP to (7,5), then LEFT three times to (4,5).\n\nThat's four moves: up, left, left, left.\n\nBut each turn, I can only move once. So, perhaps in the next move, I should go up.\n\nOption 2: Move RIGHT to (8,4), then to (9,4), then up to (9,5). That's three moves.\n\nBut wait, I have to think about what to do next. But the question is, what's my next move, so I need to decide whether to go up, right, down, or left.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving left to (6,4) but that's towards the enemy at (4,4), so I can't go that way because I might run into the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (4,4), so if I move left, I go towards x=7-1=6, which is still safe, but moving further left would approach (4,4). So, if I move left now, I would be at (6,4). Then, the next move, I could go left again to (5,4), then perhaps up or something. But I need to avoid (4,4).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps moving up first is safer because it gets me away from the enemy.\n\nSo, if I move up to (7,5), that's a safe move. Then, next move, I can go left to (6,5), then left again to (5,5), then left to (4,5) where the apple is. That would take three more moves after moving up.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (8,4) now, and then up to (8,5), then to (9,5) for the apple there. But that apple is further away.\n\nSo, which apple is closer? The one at (4,5) is 3 left and 1 up, total of 4 steps. The one at (9,5) is 2 right and 1 up, 3 steps. Wait, actually, from (7,4):\n\nTo (4,5): moving left 3 and up 1, but that's a diagonal, but in terms of steps, you have to move each direction one step at a time. So, from (7,4), moving up to (7,5) then left to (6,5), (5,5), (4,5): total 4 steps.\n\nTo (9,5): moving right to (8,4), then (9,4), then up to (9,5): 3 steps.\n\nHmm, that's closer. But wait, is there any risk in moving right? The enemy is at (4,4), so moving right towards x=8,9 shouldn't be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, moving up first might be safer because it gets me away from the enemy's position. But let me think about what's around.\n\nAfter moving right to (8,4), I'm at (8,4) next. Then, I can go to (9,4) and then up to (9,5) for the apple. But I should check if (9,5) is an apple. Yes, it is. So, that could be a plan.\n\nBut wait, in the board state provided, at row 5, the columns are 0,4,5, etc. So, (9,5) is indeed an apple.\n\nSo, moving to the right towards (9,5) in three steps is possible. Alternatively, moving up to (7,5) and then left to (4,5) would be four steps.\n\nBut which path is safer? Since the enemy is at (4,4), moving towards the right seems to avoid any potential conflicts, as the enemy is on the left side.\n\nAnother consideration is that moving right might put me near the edge of the board at x=9, but that's within bounds, so no problem.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up, I can go towards the apple at (1,7), which is much further away, but perhaps I can get there eventually.\n\nWait, but I don't need to decide the entire path right now; I just need to decide the next move. So, the options are up, down, left, or right.\n\nIf I move up, I go to (7,5), which is safe because there's nothing there except perhaps an apple at (4,5), but I'm not there yet.\n\nIf I move right, I go to (8,4), which is also safe because the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm moving away.\n\nIf I move left, I go to (6,4), which is towards the enemy, but it's still two units away, so that's probably safe now.\n\nIf I move down, I go to (7,3), which is empty as far as I can tell.\n\nSo, which direction is better?\n\nI think moving right to (8,4) makes sense because it gets me closer to the apple at (9,5). Alternatively, moving up to (7,5) starts me on the path to (4,5).\n\nBut I also have to think about the enemy. If the enemy is at (4,4), and I'm at (7,4), if I move left, I'm getting closer to the enemy, but moving right or up moves me away. So, to avoid potential conflict, moving away from the enemy might be safer.\n\nTherefore, moving right to (8,4) seems like a good option. Then, in the next moves, I can move right again to (9,4) and then up to (9,5) to eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving up might be better because it gets me closer to the apple at (4,5), but I have to make sure that path is clear.\n\nWait, perhaps moving left to (6,4) is also an option, but that's towards the enemy. But since the enemy is at (4,4), moving left to (6,4), then (5,4), then I can decide to go up to avoid the enemy.\n\nBut that might be more complicated. I think moving right to (8,4) is safer because I'm not approaching the enemy.\n\nSo, I think I'll choose to move right next.\n</think>\n\nTo get closer to the apple at (9,5) and avoid potential conflict with the enemy at (4,4), I'll move right to (8,4).\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm controlling snake ID 1, which is currently at (9,4). The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, my snake is at the far right side, somewhere in the middle vertically.\n\nApples are located at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), (1,7), and (5,4). My next move was RIGHT, which I decided last turn to move towards the apple at (9,5) and avoid the enemy at (4,4). So I went from (9,4) to (8,4). Wait, no, moving RIGHT would increase the x-coordinate, so from (9,4) moving RIGHT would take me to (10,4), which is outside the board. Wait, that can't be right. Oh wait, maybe I made a mistake last time. Because moving RIGHT from (9,4) would go to (10,4), which is a wall, so that would cause me to die. Oh no, that's bad. So maybe I should reconsider.\n\nWait, no, in the previous move, I was at (9,4) and the last move was RIGHT, so that would have taken me to (8,4)? No, because moving RIGHT increases x, so from 9 to 10, which is outside. So perhaps I miswrote the last move. Or perhaps the snake can't move right from (9,4) because it's at the edge.\n\nWait, looking back, the user's last move information says they moved RIGHT to (8,4). But wait, from (9,4), moving RIGHT would take you to (10,4), which is a wall. So maybe there's a confusion here. Perhaps they meant to move LEFT to (8,4). Or perhaps I'm misunderstanding how the coordinates work.\n\nWait, the user's last move was RIGHT, leading to (8,4). So maybe the snake moved from (9,4) to (8,4) by going LEFT? Because moving RIGHT from x=9 would go beyond the board. So perhaps that's a mistake in the last move. Alternatively, maybe the snake can't move RIGHT from (9,4) because it's blocked by the wall, so it somehow stayed put? Or maybe the enemy is blocking.\n\nWait, looking at the board state, in row 4, at (5,4) there's an apple, and at (9,4) is my snake. Enemy snake #2 is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, in row 4, the positions are clear except for the apple at (5,4) and my position at (9,4). So moving LEFT from (9,4) would take me to (8,4), which is empty. So perhaps the last move was LEFT, not RIGHT. So maybe there was a mistake in the previous move.\n\nWait, the last move info says: \"Direction: RIGHT, Rationale: To move towards the apple at (9,5) and avoid the enemy at (4,4), I'll go right to (8,4).\" Wait, that doesn't make sense. Because moving RIGHT from (9,4) would take me to (10,4), which is a wall, causing me to die. So maybe the user made a mistake in the last move. So perhaps the correct move was LEFT to (8,4), because moving RIGHT from (9,4) is invalid.\n\nSo, now, after the last move, I'm at (8,4). What's the current state? Let me check the board again.\n\nThe apples are at (0,5), (9,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4). My snake is at (8,4). Enemy snake #2 is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, the enemy is in row 5, column 3 and 4. So, enemy is not blocking me in row 4.\n\nLooking at my position, (8,4), I need to decide the next move. The goal is to eat an apple to grow and gain points. So, which apple is closest?\n\nApples at (5,4) is in the same row, 3 units to the left. Apple at (9,5) is one unit up from my current position if I go to (8,5). Wait, (9,5) is at column 9, row 5. So from (8,4), moving up once would take me to (8,5), which is empty. Then moving RIGHT to (9,5) would get me the apple. So that's a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (5,4) is to the left, but that's 3 moves away. But moving towards (9,5) is closer. Also, since I'm at (8,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,4), which is my previous position, but that's not helpful. Wait, but (9,5) is an apple, so I could go up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) to eat it.\n\nBut wait, the apple at (5,4) is in the same row, so maybe I should go there first. But it's 3 moves to the left. However, moving towards (9,5) is only two moves: up then right.\n\nBut I should also be cautious about the enemy. The enemy snake is at (3,5) with body at (4,5). So, row 5, columns 3 and 4. So, if I move up to (8,5), I'm at column 8, which is far from the enemy. So that's safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving LEFT to (7,4) to head towards (5,4) is better. But let's see which apple is closer.\n\nFrom (8,4):\n\n- To (5,4): distance is 3 (left 3 times).\n- To (9,5): distance is 2 (up once, then right once).\n\nSo, (9,5) is closer. So moving towards (9,5) seems better.\n\nBut wait, if I move up to (8,5), then right to (9,5), I can get the apple. But I need to check if any enemy is in the way. Since the enemy is at (3,5) and (4,5), they're to the left of (8,5), so no collision there.\n\nSo, moving up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) would let me eat the apple. Then I grow by one, gain a point, and my snake becomes longer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe moving to (7,4) first, but that seems less efficient.\n\nWait, is there any other apple closer? No, the other apples are at (0,5), (0,4), and (1,7), which are much farther.\n\nSo, plan is to move UP to (8,5), then RIGHT to (9,5) to get the apple.\n\nWait, but after moving up, I'll be at (8,5). Is that position safe? Let me check the board. At row 5, the enemy is at (3,5) and (4,5), so (8,5) is clear.\n\nSo, moving UP is safe. So next move should be UP.\n\nWait, but another thought: after moving to (8,5), I'm moving towards (9,5), which is an apple. But what if the enemy moves towards that area? But in this turn, it's my move first, so I can take the apple before the enemy does.\n\nAlso, considering that moving to (8,5) doesn't block me from other paths, seems safe.\n\nAnother consideration: if I go up to (8,5), then right to (9,5) to eat the apple, that's two moves. But I can only make one move now, so in this turn, I will move UP to (8,5), and in the next turn, move RIGHT to (9,5).\n\nSo, I should decide to move UP now.\n\nWait, but the current position is (8,4). So moving UP would go to (8,5), which is correct.\n\nAlternatively, could I go RIGHT to (9,4), but that's moving back to where I was, which isn't helpful unless I'm trying to get to (9,5) from there. But from (9,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (10,4), which is a wall, so that's not possible. So from (8,4), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,4), which is okay, but then I'm back where I was, not moving towards the apple. So moving UP seems better.\n\nWait, from (8,4), moving RIGHT goes to (9,4), which is my previous position. But that's possible if I want to turn around. But moving UP seems more strategic towards the apple.\n\nSo, the decision is to move UP to (8,5), heading towards (9,5) to eat the apple.\n</think>\n\nNext, I will move UP to (8,5) to approach the apple at (9,5). This move is safe and brings me closer to an apple, allowing me to grow and gain a point.\n\nUP"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm controlling Snake #1 in this 10x10 board. My current position is at (9,6), and I just moved up to get here. Let me try to figure out my next move.\n\nFirst, let me recall the board state. The apples are at (0,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4), (7,4). So, the closest ones to me would probably be (5,4) and (7,4). But I need to check the positions of the other snake, Snake #2, which is at (1,5) with a body at (2,5). That's on the opposite side of the board, so maybe not a direct threat right now.\n\nMy last move was UP, which took me from (9,5) to (9,6). I was heading towards the apple at (9,5), but wait, no, looking back, the apples don't include (9,5). Hmm, maybe I made a mistake there. Let me re-examine the apples: (0,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4), (7,4). So the only apple near me is if I go down to (9,5) or (9,4), but those don't have apples. Wait, looking back at the board state, I see that at (9,6) there's the snake head, and at (9,5) there's a 'T', but that might be an apple. Wait, no, the apples are listed as specific points, so perhaps the 'T's on the board are something else.\n\nWait, the board state is a bit confusing. Let me parse it again:\n\nRow 9: all dots except (9,9), I think. Wait, the coordinates increase upwards and to the right. So row 9 is the top, and column 9 is the rightmost. So looking at the board, each row is numbered from 9 downwards to 0. So at y=9, x=9 is the top right.\n\nWait, I think I might be getting the rows and columns mixed up. Let me clarify: the board is presented with row 9 at the top, and each row goes from x=0 to x=9. So the first line is y=9, then y=8, down to y=0. So when the snake is at (9,6), that's x=9, y=6, which would be on row 6, the furthest right column.\n\nLooking back at the board, at row 6 (which is the line starting with 6.), there's a dot at (6,9), and my snake is at (9,6), which is correct because my position is (9,6), so that's on row 6, column 9.\n\nThe apples are at:\n\n(0,5): x=0, y=5 \u2192 row 5, column 0.\n\n(0,4): row 4, column 0.\n\n(1,7): row 7, column 1.\n\n(5,4): row 4, column 5.\n\n(7,4): row 4, column7.\n\nSo, the closest apple to me is (5,4) and (7,4). Let me check the distance.\n\nI'm at (9,6). To reach (5,4), it's 4 steps left and 2 steps down. To reach (7,4), it's 2 steps left and 2 steps down.\n\nBut I need to see if the path is clear. However, moving towards (7,4) would be shorter, but I also have to avoid any obstacles.\n\nThe enemy snake #2 is at (1,5) with body at (2,5). That's on the left side, so maybe I don't have to worry about it right now.\n\nSo, I should plan a path towards the nearest apple. Since I'm at (9,6), moving left (decreasing x) would take me towards the center. But I should check the possible directions to see what's safe.\n\nIf I move LEFT, I'll go to (8,6). Is that safe? Let me check the board. At row 6, x=8 is a dot, so it's empty. Also, moving left is towards the apples at x=7,5, etc.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (9,6) would take me to (9,5), which on the board is labeled as 'A' and has a 'T' next to it, but according to the apple list, (9,5) isn't an apple. Wait, the apples are at (0,5), (0,4), (1,7), (5,4), (7,4). So (9,5) isn't an apple. Therefore, moving down to (9,5) might not be helpful unless there's an apple there that I'm missing. Wait, maybe I misread the board. Let me check the board description again.\n\nLooking at the board description, it says:\n\n5 A 2 T . . . . . . T\n\nSo at row 5, x=0 is A (apple), x=1 is 2 (snake #2), x=2 is T. Then from x=3 onwards, dots, until x=7 is A, x=8 is A, and x=9 is T.\n\nWait, no, the board's row 5 is:\n\nAt row 5 (y=5), the positions are:\n\nx=0: A (apple)\n\nx=1: 2 (snake head)\n\nx=2: T\n\nx=3: empty\n\nx=4: empty\n\nx=5: empty\n\nx=6: empty\n\nx=7: A (apple)\n\nx=8: A (apple)\n\nx=9: T.\n\nWait, so at x=9, y=5 is T, which I think stands for an apple that's taken or maybe an enemy's tail? Or perhaps it's just another symbol. But according to the apple positions given, only (0,5) is an apple, not (9,5). So my mistake earlier; moving down to (9,5) isn't helpful because there's no apple there.\n\nTherefore, my best bet is to move towards the apple at (7,4). Let me plan the path.\n\nFrom (9,6), I can move left to (8,6), then left to (7,6). From there, moving down to (7,5), then down again to (7,4), which is an apple.\n\nAlternatively, I can go down first to (9,5), but since there's no apple, that's not helpful. So moving left is better.\n\nLet me check if moving left is safe. The board shows at (8,6) is empty, and (7,6) is also empty. Then, moving down from (7,6) to (7,5), which is empty, and then to (7,4) for the apple.\n\nSo the next move should be LEFT to (8,6).\n\nWait, but maybe moving down first from (9,6) to (9,5) and then moving left? Let me see. (9,5) is a 'T', which I'm not sure what it is. Maybe it's the tail of another snake? If that's the case, moving there would cause me to collide with the tail, resulting in death. So I should avoid (9,5).\n\nTherefore, moving left is safer. So my next move is LEFT.\n\nBut wait, I just moved up to (9,6), so moving left from here is possible. Let me confirm that there are no other snakes or walls blocking me.\n\nThe board shows no other snakes near the right side except snake #2 on the left. So moving left is clear.\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nI'll move left to head towards the apple at (7,4). \n\nUP\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current situation.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake, snake ID 1, is currently at (7,6). There are several apples on the board: at (1,7), (5,4), (7,4), (1,6), and (6,3). \n\nLooking at where I am now, (7,6), I want to get to the nearest apple. The apples are at different positions, so I should calculate the distance from my current position to each apple to decide which one is closest.\n\nLet's calculate the distances:\n\n1. Apple at (1,7): The distance here is the sum of the horizontal and vertical differences. So, |7-1| + |6-7| = 6 + 1 = 7 units.\n2. Apple at (5,4): |7-5| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4 units.\n3. Apple at (7,4): This is directly below me, same x-coordinate. So, |7-7| + |6-4| = 0 + 2 = 2 units.\n4. Apple at (1,6): |7-1| + |6-6| = 6 + 0 = 6 units.\n5. Apple at (6,3): |7-6| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4 units.\n\nFrom these calculations, the closest apple is at (7,4), just two units below my current position. So that's my target.\n\nNow, I need to figure out the best path to get there without hitting anything. My snake is moving on a grid, so each move changes either the x or y coordinate by 1. Since the apple is directly below me on the same x-coordinate (7), I can just move down twice.\n\nBut wait, there's an enemy snake, snake ID 2, positioned at (0,4) with its body at [(0,5), (1,5), (2,5)]. I should check if moving down will cause me to collide with any part of this snake's body.\n\nLooking at snake 2's positions: it's at (0,4), (0,5), (1,5), (2,5). None of these are on the same x-coordinate as me (7) or in the path I need to take. So, moving down from (7,6) to (7,5) and then to (7,4) shouldn't be a problem.\n\nBut let me double-check the board state provided. The board shows that at y=6, x=7, my snake's head is at (7,6). Below that, at y=5, x=7, it's empty. Similarly, at y=4, x=7, there's an apple. So, the path is clear.\n\nAnother consideration: after moving down, will I hit myself? My snake's body is moving forward, so as long as I don't make a U-turn into my own body, I should be fine. Since I'm moving down and my body is following, it shouldn't be an issue.\n\nWait, actually, my last move was LEFT, which was to get to (7,6) from maybe (8,6) or something? Hmm, I'm not sure about the previous positions of my body. But since the last move was LEFT and I'm now at (7,6), moving down should be okay as long as my body doesn't obscure that path. Since the board shows only my head at (7,6), I can assume the body is behind, so moving down is safe.\n\nSo, the plan is to move down once to (7,5), then again to (7,4) to eat the apple. But I need to decide the next single move. So the first step is to move down from (7,6) to (7,5). \n\nDo I have any other immediate threats or considerations? Let me check the other apples. The next closest after (7,4) is (5,4) and (6,3), both 4 units away. But since (7,4) is just two moves away, it's better to go for that first.\n\nAnother point to consider: growing by eating the apple will make my snake longer, which is good for blocking enemies and having more points. So it's beneficial to get it.\n\nPotential alternative: What if I decide to go for the apple at (5,4) instead? Let's see, from (7,6) to (5,4), I need to move left two times and down two times. That's four moves. Whereas (7,4) is just two moves. So it's more efficient to go for (7,4).\n\nAlso, I should check if there's any enemy nearby that could interfere. Snake 2 is at (0,4), which is far from my current position, so it won't block my path to (7,4).\n\nTherefore, the best move is to go DOWN to reach the apple at (7,4).\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (7,4), I'll move down from (7,6). This path is clear of obstacles and enemy snakes.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm controlling snake number 1, which is currently at (7,4). The board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My last move was DOWN, which I think was intended to go towards an apple at (7,4), but wait, that's where I already am. Hmm, maybe that's a mistake.\n\nLooking at the apples, they're at (1,7), (5,4), (1,6), (6,3), and (4,4). My position is (7,4). So, the closest apple would be at (5,4) or (6,3). Wait, (5,4) is two steps left on the same y-level, and (6,3) is one step left and one step down. Alternatively, (4,4) is three steps left. Wait, no, the apple at (4,4) is three steps left from me, but actually, in the current board state, I'm at (7,4), so moving left would decrease x. So, (5,4) is x=5, which is two steps left from me. (4,4) is three steps left.\n\nLooking at the board, there's another snake, snake number 2, whose head is at (2,4) and its body is at [(1,4), (0,4), (0,5)]. Wait, so snake 2 is moving along the x=0 to x=2, y=4 and y=5. So, its body is from (1,4) to (0,4), and then up to (0,5). So, that's in the lower left part of the board, while I'm at (7,4), which is more to the right.\n\nI need to decide my next move. Since I was just moving DOWN, maybe that's not the right direction because moving down from (7,4) would take me to y=3. Is there an apple there? Let's see: apples at y=3 is (6,3). So, that's two steps left and one step down, but moving to (7,3) wouldn't get me there. Alternatively, perhaps I should move towards (5,4) or (6,3).\n\nWait, let me check the board again. The apples: (1,7), (5,4), (1,6), (6,3), (4,4). So, (5,4) is at x=5, y=4, which is two steps left of my current position. That's possible. Alternatively, (6,3) is at x=6, y=3, which is one step left and one down from me.\n\nBut wait, in my last move, I went DOWN from maybe (7,5) to (7,4), perhaps? Because the previous move was DOWN, so my next move was to (7,4). Now, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at possible directions:\n\n- UP: Would take me to (7,5). Is there an apple there? No, the apples are at lower y's except for (1,7) and (1,6). So UP might not be useful unless I'm trying to get away from something.\n\n- DOWN: To (7,3). Is there an apple there? No, the nearest apple is at (6,3), which is left one and down one.\n\n- LEFT: To (6,4). That's moving towards (5,4), which is an apple. So that's a possible direction.\n\n- RIGHT: To (8,4). But that's moving away from the apples, so probably not useful.\n\nSo, considering that, moving LEFT would take me closer to the apple at (5,4). But I need to check if that's safe. Are there any obstacles or enemies in that path?\n\nSnake #2 is at (2,4) with body at (1,4), (0,4), (0,5). So, snake #2's body is along x=0, y=4, and (1,4). So, at x=2, y=4 is the head. So, moving to (6,4) would be safe from snake #2, since snake #2 is far to the left.\n\nWhat about my own body? Wait, since I'm just a single segment right now, I don't have a body to worry about. So, moving left to (6,4) is possible.\n\nAlternatively, could I move DOWN to (7,3) and then LEFT to (6,3) to reach the apple at (6,3)? That might be a better option because (6,3) is closer than (5,4). Let's check the distance: moving left twice would take two steps to reach (5,4). Moving down once and left once would take two steps to reach (6,3). So, both options are two steps away, but (6,3) is diagonally closer.\n\nWait, but moving to (6,3) would require moving DOWN and then LEFT, but in the next move, I can only choose one direction. So, in the next move, if I choose DOWN, I'd go to (7,3), which is one step towards (6,3). Then, from there, I can move LEFT to (6,3) in the next move. Alternatively, if I move LEFT now to (6,4), and then down in the next move to (6,3), that would also take two moves.\n\nSo, both options take two steps. Alternatively, perhaps I should head towards (5,4) because it's on the same y-level, so maybe that's a straight line.\n\nWait, but there's an apple at (4,4) as well, which is three steps left from me. So, if I go LEFT three times, I can reach (4,4). But that might take longer, and perhaps another snake could interfere.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should prioritize getting an apple quickly. Since (5,4) is two moves away, and (6,3) is two moves away, but perhaps (5,4) is safer because it's on the same y-level and maybe there's less chance of collision.\n\nWait, let me check what's around me. Are there any walls or other snakes nearby? My position is (7,4). To the right, there's (8,4), which seems empty. To the left, (6,4) is empty, I think. From the board state, in row 4, positions at x=4,5,6,7 are T, T, A, A, and me at (7,4). So, (5,4) is an apple, (4,4) is another apple, but (6,4) is an apple as well? Wait no, looking back, the apples are at (1,7), (5,4), (1,6), (6,3), (4,4). So, in row 4, y=4, the apples are at x=5 and x=4. So, (5,4) and (4,4) are apples. But in my current position, (7,4), moving left to (6,4) would take me to x=6, y=4, which is empty, but the apple is at (5,4). So, moving left twice would get me there.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,3) and then LEFT to (6,3) is another path. But (6,3) is an apple as well.\n\nSo, which path is better? Let me think about the possible dangers.\n\nSnake #2 is at (2,4), and its body is along x=0-2, y=4 and y=5. So, if I move towards (5,4), I'm moving left from (7,4) to (6,4) and then (5,4). Is there any chance of collision with snake #2? No, because snake #2 is at x=2, y=4, which is far to the left. So, moving towards (5,4) is safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (6,3) would require going down to (7,3) and then left to (6,3). That also seems safe because there's no snake in that area.\n\nBut perhaps moving towards (5,4) is better because it's on the same y-level, and I can get there without changing direction, while moving towards (6,3) would require a direction change in the next move.\n\nAlternatively, think about which apple is more accessible without competition. If snake #2 is on the left side, maybe the apples on the right are less contested.\n\nWait, but what about other snakes? Only snake #2 is mentioned. So, it's just me and snake #2.\n\nI think the best move is to go towards the closer apple, which would be either (5,4) or (6,3). Both are two steps away. But perhaps (5,4) is better because it's on the same level, so I can keep moving left without changing direction, which might be safer.\n\nWait, but in the current setup, (7,4) is on the far right of the board. So, moving left to (6,4) is possible, and then to (5,4) to get the apple. That seems straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (7,3) to get towards (6,3) might also be a good idea. Let me see which apple is closer in terms of steps. Both require two moves, so it's a tie.\n\nBut perhaps (6,3) is better because it's closer in terms of Euclidean distance. Let me calculate: from (7,4) to (5,4) is 2 steps left. From (7,4) to (6,3) is 1 left and 1 down, total 2 steps as well. So, same number of steps. So, perhaps I can choose either.\n\nWait, let me check if moving down from (7,4) to (7,3) is safe. Are there any obstacles or other snakes? The board shows that at y=3, x=6 is an apple, so it's safe. So, moving down is possible.\n\nAlternatively, moving left to (6,4) is safe as well.\n\nSo, perhaps I should choose the direction that leads me closer to an apple without any risk. Both options seem safe.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go towards (6,3) because it's an apple that's not aligned with other snakes. Let me choose to move down to (7,3), then next move left to (6,3) to eat the apple.\n\nWait, but in the next move, I can only move once. So, in the current turn, I need to decide which direction to go. If I move DOWN now, I can then move LEFT in the next turn to reach the apple.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now would lead me to (6,4), and then in the next move, I can move left again to (5,4) to get the apple.\n\nSo, both options are viable. Maybe I should choose the path that's less likely to be contested. Since snake #2 is on the left, maybe going towards (6,3) is better because it's further right and less likely for snake #2 to reach it before me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps (5,4) is better because it's closer to me in x direction. I'm at x=7, so two left moves would take me to (5,4).\n\nI think I'll choose to move LEFT to (6,4), then in the next move, move left again to (5,4) to eat that apple.\n\nSo, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is LEFT to head towards the apple at (5,4). This direction is chosen to move closer to an apple while avoiding potential collisions with other snakes or walls.\n\n**Move:** LEFT"
