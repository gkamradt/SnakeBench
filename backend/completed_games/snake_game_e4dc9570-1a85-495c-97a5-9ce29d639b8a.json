It was crucial to keep myself safe from the threatening enemy while also positioning myself for the upcoming apples.\n\nStrategy: With the last move, my goal was to avoid conflict with the enemy snake and also grab as many apples as I can. My primary objective was to go for the apple at (3,4) if the enemy snake moved towards the left. However, if the snake did not position itself near this apple, I had planned to continue moving towards right and then upwards to reach the apples at (5,8) and (4,9).

This will give me an option to move in either direction for the apples at (4,9), (5,8) and (6,2).\n\nStrategy: The strategy remains the same from the last move.

If the snake moves towards (3,4), I can move right and go for the apple at (6,2), else I can keep moving upwards and secure the apples at (4,9) and (5,8).\n\nNext move: UP.

            "rationale": "--Your last move information--\n\nDirection: RIGHT\nRationale: The enemy snake was positioned left of my position. Moving towards the right allowed me to gain some distance from that snake and also brought me closer to the apples located at (3,4), (5,8), and (4,9). It was crucial to keep myself safe from the threatening enemy while also positioning myself for the upcoming apples.\n\nStrategy: With the last move, my goal was to avoid conflict with the enemy snake and also grab as many apples as I can. My primary objective was to go for the apple at (3,4) if the enemy snake moved towards the left. However, if the snake did not position itself near this apple, I had planned to continue moving towards right and then upwards to reach the apples at (5,8) and (4,9). The secondary plan was to fetch the apple at (6,2), but this largely hinged on the enemy's moves.\n\n--End of your last move information--\n\n--Your next move information--\n\nDirection: UP\nRationale: As of now, the closest apple is at (3,4). Now, if I move upwards, I can easily grab this apple and grow while also maintaining myself in the center of the board, able to move freely in any direction. This will give me an option to move in either direction for the apples at (4,9), (5,8) and (6,2).\n\nStrategy: The strategy remains the same from the last move. The main goal is to avoid the enemy at all costs. After moving up, I will have 3 apples in the vicinity. Depending on the movements of the snake, I can move accordingly. If the snake moves towards (3,4), I can move right and go for the apple at (6,2), else I can keep moving upwards and secure the apples at (4,9) and (5,8).\n\nNext move: UP. This move will keep me safe and in a central location with enough apples in proximity. A movement up also indirectly decreases the chance of any encounter with the snake, thus ensuring safety.\n\n--End of your next move information--"

The apple at (3,4) is the nearest and advancing upwards gives me a chance to get it. Additionally, this move commands central presence on the board and gives the flexibility to steer towards any direction based on the other snake\u2019s movement. This also reduces the risk of collision with the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy: The same strategy still applies - avoid the enemy snake while gunning for the apples. After moving up, the apples at (4,9) and (5,8) seem to be the next logical targets. Meanwhile, the other apple at (6,2) serves as a plan B. Depending on where the enemy snake decides to slither, I can decide which apple to chase next.\n\nNext move: UP.
