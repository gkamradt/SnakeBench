Since there's an enemy snake at (0,7), I need to be careful not to get trapped if I go left. However, going LEFT to get the apple at (1,7) is still safe because:\n1.

I also see that there's an enemy snake, #1, at (2,7), but since I'm not in danger of colliding with it by moving towards the apple, I can safely go for it. My strategy for the next turn will be to continue looking for nearby apples and avoiding any potential collisions with other snakes or walls.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
