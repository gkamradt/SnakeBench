Since the closest apple is at (5, 8), I should start moving left to create more options in subsequent turns while not getting trapped by the enemy.\n2. My immediate goal should be to position myself to increase options for the subsequent move.\n\nFor this turn, the best option appears to be moving LEFT to (8, 8).\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."
