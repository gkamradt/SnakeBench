Moving here would result in a collision and death.\n\n3. **LEFT to (2, 6):**\n   - **Pros:** Safe move.\n   - **Cons:** Moves away from the nearest apple at (3, 9), potentially increasing the distance to the next point.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (4, 6):**\n   - **Pros:** Moves towards the apple at (7, 6).\n   - **Cons:** Further away from the apple at (3, 9) and may require additional moves to reach it.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nPrioritize moving towards the closest apple while ensuring safety from enemy snakes. After moving UP, continue assessing the path to (3, 9) and remain vigilant of enemy positions to avoid traps.\n\n**Next Move:** UP"

There's an apple at position (2, 4) which is relatively close to me, but I'd need to move down and left to get to it.\n\nHowever, I think I'll prioritize moving away from the enemy snake for now. I'll move up to get some distance between us. This will also give me a better view of the board and potential future moves.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movement and plan a route to the nearest apple.\n\nNext move: UP"
