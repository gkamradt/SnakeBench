There are also apples at (4, 8), (0, 1), (3, 4), and (9, 9).\n   - I want to prioritize getting apples while keeping an eye on the other snake and board boundaries.\n\n2. **Immediate Threats**:\n   - Snake #2 is at position (9, 5). It is a single point at this time, so its threat level is relatively low, but moving closer to it should be done cautiously.\n   - I need to avoid moving off the grid or positions that could make future moves difficult given available options.\n\n3. **Potential Moves and Outcomes**:\n   - **UP (to 8, 4)**: This move continues me in the upward direction. No apples immediately but keeps options open to move toward (6, 3) next or reassess afterward.\n   - **DOWN (to 8, 2)**: This takes me away from the nearest apple and lower on the board. Less optimal.\n   - **LEFT (to 7, 3)**: Moves me slightly closer to the apple at (6, 3).

It directly approaches the nearest apple at (6, 3) in the shortest path and keeps my options open for moving UP or LEFT afterward while evaluating any potential threats.\n\n5. **Strategy for Next Turn**:\n   - Continue focusing on the apple at (6, 3), while watching for Snake #2's movements.\n   - Keep options open to move back towards other apples if circumstances change, especially if any other snakes pose more of a threat or occupy advantageous positions.\n\n**Decided Move: LEFT**"
