Our possible moves from (1,8) are: UP \u2192 (1,9), LEFT \u2192 (0,8), or DOWN \u2192 (1,7). (We can\u2019t go RIGHT because that would hit our own body at (2,8).)\n\nNext, let\u2019s check on the apples. The five apples are at:\n\u2022 (4,1)\n\u2022 (8,4)\n\u2022 (0,6)\n\u2022 (3,6)\n\u2022 (4,4)\n\nUsing Manhattan distance from our head (1,8):\n\u2022 Apple at (4,1) is 3 + 7 = 10 units away.\n\u2022 Apple at (8,4) is 7 + 4 = 11 units away.\n\u2022 Apple at (0,6) is 1 + 2 = 3 units away.\n\u2022 Apple at (3,6) is 2 + 2 = 4 units away.\n\u2022 Apple at (4,4) is 3 + 4 = 7 units away.\n\nThe closest apple is at (0,6).\n\nFrom our current head at (1,8), a good strategy is to move toward (0,6). If we move LEFT, our head will go to (0,8). Then a downward move in subsequent turns can put us in line with the apple at (0,6). There don\u2019t appear to be obstacles on that route\u2014in our case, no walls in the way and no enemy segments near that planned path.\n\nI also checked the other options:\n\u2022 Moving DOWN to (1,7) would also eventually allow us to get toward (0,6), but moving LEFT immediately brings our x coordinate in line with the apple.\n\u2022 Moving UP to (1,9) would move us away from our target.\n\nThus, continuing our strategy of reaching the nearest apple, the best move is to go LEFT.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."

Moving UP towards the (4,4) apple would put my head adjacent to my body, a dangerous move.
