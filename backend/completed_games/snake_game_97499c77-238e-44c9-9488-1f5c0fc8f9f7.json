The snake could potentially move in any direction starting from that position. However, its current position does not impose an immediate threat to me unless it moves towards the lower left.\n\n4. **Strategy:**\n   - Moving DOWN is essential as moving UP is not an option due to the wall and my foremost goal is to survive while aiming to collect apples.\n   - Choose the direction LEFT or RIGHT based on proximity and path clarity to the apples. The apple at (3, 6) is directly left three times and down three times, which is closer and potentially safer than moving to (5, 7), where I would need to move right once and then down twice, possibly getting closer to Snake #2.\n\n5. **Future Strategy:**\n   - After collecting the apple at (3, 6), reassess the board state, considering the new position of Snake #2.\n   - Plan a route potentially towards (5, 7) or any new apples that appear while keeping safe distances from the edges and the enemy snake.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** Initially, to start heading towards the apple at (3, 6) safely, I should move DOWN this turn.\n\n**Action:** DOWN."
