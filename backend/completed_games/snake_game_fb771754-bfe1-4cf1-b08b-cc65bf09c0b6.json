The enemy snake, #2, is at (5, 4) but has no body length, so it's not a significant threat at the moment.\n\nMy goal is to move towards an apple while avoiding the enemy snake and the walls. The closest apple to my current position is at (7, 0), which is directly below me, but moving down to get it might not be the best choice since it's a bit far and there are other apples closer in terms of total distance (considering both x and y coordinates).\n\nAnother apple is at (2, 3), which is closer in terms of total distance to travel (I need to move left and slightly up). However, moving directly towards (2, 3) would require navigating around the enemy snake's position, which could be risky.\n\nThe apple at (4, 2) is also relatively close and moving towards it would not require navigating through the enemy snake's position immediately. It's slightly down and to the left from my current position.\n\nConsidering these options, moving towards the apple at (4, 2) seems like a reasonable strategy for now, as it avoids immediate conflict with the enemy snake and is a relatively short distance away.\n\nTo start moving towards (4, 2), I need to decrease both my x and y coordinates. The most direct move to start this path would be to move left, as it begins the process of decreasing my x coordinate.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the chosen apple, adjusting the path as necessary to avoid the enemy snake and other obstacles.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

The enemy snake, #2, is at (5, 4) but has no body length, so it's not a significant threat at the moment.\n\nMy goal is to move towards an apple while avoiding the enemy snake and the walls. The closest apple to my current position is at (7, 0), which is directly below me, but moving down to get it might not be the best choice since it's a bit far and there are other apples closer in terms of total distance (considering both x and y coordinates).\n\nAnother apple is at (2, 3), which is closer in terms of total distance to travel (I need to move left and slightly up). However, moving directly towards (2, 3) would require navigating around the enemy snake's position, which could be risky.\n\nThe apple at (4, 2) is also relatively close and moving towards it would not require navigating through the enemy snake's position immediately. It's slightly down and to the left from my current position.\n\nConsidering these options, moving towards the apple at (4, 2) seems like a reasonable strategy for now, as it avoids immediate conflict with the enemy snake and is a relatively short distance away.\n\nTo start moving towards (4, 2), I need to decrease both my x and y coordinates. The most direct move to start this path would be to move left, as it begins the process of decreasing my x coordinate.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the chosen apple, adjusting the path as necessary to avoid the enemy snake and other obstacles.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

The enemy snake, #2, is at (5, 4) but has no body length, so it's not a significant threat at the moment.\n\nMy goal is to move towards an apple while avoiding the enemy snake and the walls. The closest apple to my current position is at (7, 0), which is directly below me, but moving down to get it might not be the best choice since it's a bit far and there are other apples closer in terms of total distance (considering both x and y coordinates).\n\nAnother apple is at (2, 3), which is closer in terms of total distance to travel (I need to move left and slightly up). However, moving directly towards (2, 3) would require navigating around the enemy snake's position, which could be risky.\n\nThe apple at (4, 2) is also relatively close and moving towards it would not require navigating through the enemy snake's position immediately. It's slightly down and to the left from my current position.\n\nConsidering these options, moving towards the apple at (4, 2) seems like a reasonable strategy for now, as it avoids immediate conflict with the enemy snake and is a relatively short distance away.\n\nTo start moving towards (4, 2), I need to decrease both my x and y coordinates. The most direct move to start this path would be to move left, as it begins the process of decreasing my x coordinate.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue moving towards the chosen apple, adjusting the path as necessary to avoid the enemy snake and other obstacles.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

However, moving directly towards (2, 3) would require navigating around the enemy snake's position, which could be risky.\n\nThe apple at (4, 2) is also relatively close and moving towards it would not require navigating through the enemy snake's position immediately.
