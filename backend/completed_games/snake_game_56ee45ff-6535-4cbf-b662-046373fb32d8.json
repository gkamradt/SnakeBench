            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (8,7). There are apples at (8,4), (6,8), (9,1), (4,1), and (7,6). Enemy snake number 1 is at (9,7) with no body parts listed, so it's just its head at (9,7).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . 2 1\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . . . . A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my position is at (8,7), which is in row 7, column 8.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (9,7), which is right next to me to the right.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (8,4): row 4, column 8\n\n- (6,8): row 8, column 6\n\n- (9,1): row 1, column 9\n\n- (4,1): row 1, column 4\n\n- (7,6): row 6, column 7\n\nI need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-turn game, I need to think about a strategy that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence, not just one.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate surroundings.\n\nI'm at (8,7). Possible moves:\n\n- Up: (8,8)\n\n- Down: (8,6)\n\n- Left: (7,7)\n\n- Right: (9,7), but that's where snake 1 is, so that's a bad idea.\n\nSo, right away, moving right is out of the question because it's occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nLet's look at the apples and see which one is closest or which path allows me to pick up multiple apples.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (8,4). That's directly down from my current position. I'd have to move down three rows to get to it.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (6,8) is two rows up and two columns to the left.\n\nThe apple at (9,1) is down six rows and one column to the right, but that's where the enemy snake is heading possibly.\n\nThe apple at (4,1) is down three rows and seven columns to the left.\n\nThe apple at (7,6) is down one row and one column to the left.\n\nHmm.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (8,4), which is directly down.\n\nBut to get there, I need to move down three rows: from row 7 to row 4, column 8.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear and that no snakes are in my way.\n\nLooking at the board, between row 7 and row 4, column 8, there are no obstacles listed. So it seems safe.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, and then I can consider going for another apple.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (9,7), which is right next to me. If I move down, it might move as well.\n\nI need to consider its possible movements.\n\nAssuming snake 1 is also trying to eat apples and avoid me, I need to predict its moves.\n\nBut since I don't have information about its body or its past moves, it's hard to predict.\n\nPerhaps it will go for the apple at (9,1), which is down six rows from its position.\n\nBut that's just speculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it will try to block me or something.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe I should consider a different apple.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6,8), which is two rows up and two columns to the left.\n\nTo get there, I need to move up to (8,8), then left to (7,8), then left to (6,8).\n\nBut wait, looking at the board, row 8, column 8 is empty.\n\nThen left to (7,8), which is also empty.\n\nThen left to (6,8), which has an apple.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend.\n\nI need to make sure that in the process, I don't run into myself or any walls.\n\nAlso, I need to consider snake 1's possible moves.\n\nIf I move up to (8,8), snake 1 might move up to (9,8), but I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, it might stay put or move elsewhere.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (7,6), which is down one row and left one column.\n\nSo, down to (8,6), but that's not correct. Wait, down from (8,7) to (8,6), but the apple is at (7,6). So, actually, left to (7,7), then down to (7,6).\n\nWait, no. My current position is (8,7). To get to (7,6), I need to move left to (7,7), then down to (7,6).\n\nBut looking at the board, (7,7) is empty, and (7,6) has an apple.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend.\n\nThen, I could consider going for another apple.\n\nThis seems like a shorter path compared to going for (8,4), which is three rows down.\n\nMoreover, going down three rows might put me in the path of snake 1, which is at (9,7).\n\nSnake 1 could potentially move down towards (9,6), (9,5), etc., possibly intercepting my path if I go down.\n\nWhereas going left and down seems less likely to encounter snake 1 immediately.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nLet me map out the steps.\n\nOption 2: Go for apple at (7,6).\n\nMove left to (7,7). Then down to (7,6).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,6), I can consider my next move.\n\nFrom (7,6), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (7,7), but that's where I just came from, which is now part of my body, so can't go there.\n\n- Down to (7,5)\n\n- Left to (6,6)\n\n- Right to (8,6)\n\nI need to see which of these directions leads to an apple or a path to an apple.\n\nLooking at the board, none of these immediate positions have apples.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (7,6), I need to decide where to go next.\n\nOption 3: Go for apple at (6,8).\n\nAs previously considered, up to (8,8), then left to (7,8), then left to (6,8).\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would be at (6,8), and possible moves:\n\n- Up to (6,9)\n\n- Down to (6,7)\n\n- Left to (5,8)\n\n- Right to (7,8)\n\nAgain, no immediate apples there.\n\nI need to think about which path allows me to pick up the most apples with the least risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (4,1), which is further away, but it might be worth it if I can pick up multiple apples along the way.\n\nBut that seems too distant and risky, given the board size and the presence of the enemy snake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (9,1), which is closer.\n\nBut that's at (9,1), which is down six rows from my current position.\n\nTo get there from (8,7), I would need to move down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nBut that involves passing by snake 1, which is at (9,7).\n\nIf snake 1 moves down, it might intercept my path.\n\nThis seems risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for the apple at (8,4), which is directly down from my position.\n\nTo get there, I need to move down three rows: from (8,7) to (8,4).\n\nLet's see the path:\n\n- Down to (8,6)\n\n- Down to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8,4)\n\nLooking at the board, between row 7 and row 4, column 8 seems clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,4), I would be at (8,4), and possible moves:\n\n- Up to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (8,6), which is on the grid where X ranges from 0 to 9 and Y from 0 to 9, with (0,0) being the bottom left and (9,9) the top right. So, I'm somewhere in the middle-ish.\n\nThere are apples at (8,4), (6,8), (9,1), (4,1), and (7,6). That's five apples to potentially go for.\n\nAlso, there's an enemy snake at (9,6), right next to me. I need to be careful not to bump into it.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board. Here's what it looks like:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . .

If I move right, I'll bump into it and die. So, right is out.\n\nMoving left to (7,6) seems safe. Let's see: is there anything there? It looks empty. After moving left, I'd be at (7,6), which has an apple. So, I eat the apple, grow, and get a point.\n\nBut, I need to think about what happens after that. After eating the apple at (7,6), where do I go next?\n\nFrom (7,6), I can move up, down, left, or right.\n\n- Up to (7,7): let's see, is that safe? It's empty, looks okay.\n\n- Down to (7,5): also empty.\n\n- Left to (6,6): empty.\n\n- Right to (8,6): but that's where I just came from, which is now part of my body, so I can't go back there immediately.\n\nSo, from (7,6), moving up to (7,7) seems safe.\n\nThen, from (7,7), I can continue up to (7,8), and maybe aim for the apple at (6,8). That's a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, from (7,6), I could move left to (6,6), but there's no apple there, and I'm not sure what's beyond.\n\nWait, but the apple at (6,8) is up and to the left. Maybe aiming for that after eating the one at (7,6).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (8,4), which is directly down from my current position.\n\nLet's think about that.\n\nIf I move down from (8,6) to (8,5), then to (8,4), where there's an apple.\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to make sure the path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, between (8,6) and (8,4), it's open. So, I can move down to (8,5), then to (8,4), eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,6), which is directly to my right.\n\nIf I move down, the enemy might also move down and intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, the enemy might move up or stay put.\n\nI don't know its behavior, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (7,6) first, since it's right next to me, and then decide.\n\nAlso, considering that moving left to (7,6) is straightforward, and there's an apple there.\n\nAfter eating it, I can grow, and then maybe aim for another apple.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move left to (7,6), eat apple, grow.\n\n2. From (7,6), move up to (7,7).\n\n3. Then, move up to (7,8).\n\n4. Then, left to (6,8), eat apple.\n\nThat seems like a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (7,6), I could move down to (7,5), but there's no apple there, and I might get too close to the bottom where there's another apple at (4,1), but that seems too far away right now.\n\nSimilarly, moving left from (7,6) to (6,6) doesn't lead directly to an apple.\n\nSo, moving up seems the best option after eating (7,6).\n\nAnother consideration is that the enemy is at (9,6). If I move left to (7,6), the enemy might move left or down, but I'm not sure.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't get cornered.\n\nBut for now, moving left to (7,6) seems safe, and I can assess the situation from there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (6,8).\n\nTo do that, I'd need to move up to (8,7), then left to (7,7), then left to (6,7), then up to (6,8).\n\nThat's a longer path, and I need to make sure the enemy doesn't interfere.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for the closer apple at (7,6) is better.\n\nWait, but (7,6) is directly left of my current position, and it's an easy pick.\n\nAfter eating it, I can decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet me consider the apple at (8,4), which is directly down.\n\nTo get there, I'd need to move down from (8,6) to (8,5), then to (8,4).\n\nBut, that's two moves down, and I need to make sure the path is clear.\n\nAlso, the enemy is at (9,6), which is below me.\n\nIf the enemy moves down, it might block my path.\n\nWhereas going left to (7,6) is a safer option, as the enemy is to my right, and it would have to move left to interfere with me, which might not be its priority.\n\nAdditionally, after eating (7,6), I can aim for (6,8), which is up and left.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n- Move left to (7,6): eat apple, grow.\n\n- Move up to (7,7).\n\n- Move up to (7,8).\n\n- Move left to (6,8): eat apple.\n\nThat's four moves to get two apples.\n\nAlternatively, going down to (8,4):\n\n- Move down to (8,5).\n\n- Move down to (8,4): eat apple.\n\nThat's only two moves for one apple.\n\nSo, in terms of efficiency, going for (7,6) and then (6,8) allows me to get two apples in four moves, whereas going for (8,4) gets me one apple in two moves.\n\nTherefore, going left to (7,6) and then up to (7,7), up to (7,8), left to (6,8) seems like a better strategy in terms of points per move.\n\nAlso, it keeps me away from the enemy, which is currently to my right.\n\nI need to be cautious of the enemy's possible moves, but since I don't know its behavior, I'll assume it will try to eat apples as well.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my path, I think going left to (7,6) is the way to go.\n\nAfter that, I'll assess the situation again.\n\nSo, my decision for this turn is to move left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{LEFT}} \\]"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (8,7). There are apples at (8,4), (6,8), (9,1), (4,1), and (7,6). Enemy snake number 1 is at (9,7) with no body parts listed, so it's just its head at (9,7).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . 2 1\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . .

A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my position is at (8,7), which is in row 7, column 8.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (9,7), which is right next to me to the right.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (8,4): row 4, column 8\n\n- (6,8): row 8, column 6\n\n- (9,1): row 1, column 9\n\n- (4,1): row 1, column 4\n\n- (7,6): row 6, column 7\n\nI need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-turn game, I need to think about a strategy that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence, not just one.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate surroundings.\n\nI'm at (8,7). Possible moves:\n\n- Up: (8,8)\n\n- Down: (8,6)\n\n- Left: (7,7)\n\n- Right: (9,7), but that's where snake 1 is, so that's a bad idea.\n\nSo, right away, moving right is out of the question because it's occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nLet's look at the apples and see which one is closest or which path allows me to pick up multiple apples.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (8,4). That's directly down from my current position. I'd have to move down three rows to get to it.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (6,8) is two rows up and two columns to the left.\n\nThe apple at (9,1) is down six rows and one column to the right, but that's where the enemy snake is heading possibly.\n\nThe apple at (4,1) is down three rows and seven columns to the left.\n\nThe apple at (7,6) is down one row and one column to the left.\n\nHmm.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (8,4), which is directly down.\n\nBut to get there, I need to move down three rows: from row 7 to row 4, column 8.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear and that no snakes are in my way.\n\nLooking at the board, between row 7 and row 4, column 8, there are no obstacles listed. So it seems safe.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, and then I can consider going for another apple.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (9,7), which is right next to me. If I move down, it might move as well.\n\nI need to consider its possible movements.\n\nAssuming snake 1 is also trying to eat apples and avoid me, I need to predict its moves.\n\nBut since I don't have information about its body or its past moves, it's hard to predict.\n\nPerhaps it will go for the apple at (9,1), which is down six rows from its position.\n\nBut that's just speculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it will try to block me or something.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe I should consider a different apple.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6,8), which is two rows up and two columns to the left.\n\nTo get there, I need to move up to (8,8), then left to (7,8), then left to (6,8).\n\nBut wait, looking at the board, row 8, column 8 is empty.\n\nThen left to (7,8), which is also empty.\n\nThen left to (6,8), which has an apple.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend.\n\nI need to make sure that in the process, I don't run into myself or any walls.\n\nAlso, I need to consider snake 1's possible moves.\n\nIf I move up to (8,8), snake 1 might move up to (9,8), but I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, it might stay put or move elsewhere.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (7,6), which is down one row and left one column.\n\nSo, down to (8,6), but that's not correct. Wait, down from (8,7) to (8,6), but the apple is at (7,6). So, actually, left to (7,7), then down to (7,6).\n\nWait, no. My current position is (8,7). To get to (7,6), I need to move left to (7,7), then down to (7,6).\n\nBut looking at the board, (7,7) is empty, and (7,6) has an apple.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend.\n\nThen, I could consider going for another apple.\n\nThis seems like a shorter path compared to going for (8,4), which is three rows down.\n\nMoreover, going down three rows might put me in the path of snake 1, which is at (9,7).\n\nSnake 1 could potentially move down towards (9,6), (9,5), etc., possibly intercepting my path if I go down.\n\nWhereas going left and down seems less likely to encounter snake 1 immediately.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nLet me map out the steps.\n\nOption 2: Go for apple at (7,6).\n\nMove left to (7,7). Then down to (7,6).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,6), I can consider my next move.\n\nFrom (7,6), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (7,7), but that's where I just came from, which is now part of my body, so can't go there.\n\n- Down to (7,5)\n\n- Left to (6,6)\n\n- Right to (8,6)\n\nI need to see which of these directions leads to an apple or a path to an apple.\n\nLooking at the board, none of these immediate positions have apples.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (7,6), I need to decide where to go next.\n\nOption 3: Go for apple at (6,8).\n\nAs previously considered, up to (8,8), then left to (7,8), then left to (6,8).\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would be at (6,8), and possible moves:\n\n- Up to (6,9)\n\n- Down to (6,7)\n\n- Left to (5,8)\n\n- Right to (7,8)\n\nAgain, no immediate apples there.\n\nI need to think about which path allows me to pick up the most apples with the least risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (4,1), which is further away, but it might be worth it if I can pick up multiple apples along the way.\n\nBut that seems too distant and risky, given the board size and the presence of the enemy snake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (9,1), which is closer.\n\nBut that's at (9,1), which is down six rows from my current position.\n\nTo get there from (8,7), I would need to move down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nBut that involves passing by snake 1, which is at (9,7).\n\nIf snake 1 moves down, it might intercept my path.\n\nThis seems risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for the apple at (8,4), which is directly down from my position.\n\nTo get there, I need to move down three rows: from (8,7) to (8,4).\n\nLet's see the path:\n\n- Down to (8,6)\n\n- Down to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8,4)\n\nLooking at the board, between row 7 and row 4, column 8 seems clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,4), I would be at (8,4), and possible moves:\n\n- Up to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8"

If I move left to (7,6), the enemy might move left or down, but I'm not sure.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't get cornered.\n\nBut for now, moving left to (7,6) seems safe, and I can assess the situation from there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (6,8).\n\nTo do that, I'd need to move up to (8,7), then left to (7,7), then left to (6,7), then up to (6,8).\n\nThat's a longer path, and I need to make sure the enemy doesn't interfere.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for the closer apple at (7,6) is better.\n\nWait, but (7,6) is directly left of my current position, and it's an easy pick.\n\nAfter eating it, I can decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet me consider the apple at (8,4), which is directly down.\n\nTo get there, I'd need to move down from (8,6) to (8,5), then to (8,4).\n\nBut, that's two moves down, and I need to make sure the path is clear.\n\nAlso, the enemy is at (9,6), which is below me.\n\nIf the enemy moves down, it might block my path.\n\nWhereas going left to (7,6) is a safer option, as the enemy is to my right, and it would have to move left to interfere with me, which might not be its priority.\n\nAdditionally, after eating (7,6), I can aim for (6,8), which is up and left.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n- Move left to (7,6): eat apple, grow.\n\n- Move up to (7,7).\n\n- Move up to (7,8).\n\n- Move left to (6,8): eat apple.\n\nThat's four moves to get two apples.\n\nAlternatively, going down to (8,4):\n\n- Move down to (8,5).\n\n- Move down to (8,4): eat apple.\n\nThat's only two moves for one apple.\n\nSo, in terms of efficiency, going for (7,6) and then (6,8) allows me to get two apples in four moves, whereas going for (8,4) gets me one apple in two moves.\n\nTherefore, going left to (7,6) and then up to (7,7), up to (7,8), left to (6,8) seems like a better strategy in terms of points per move.\n\nAlso, it keeps me away from the enemy, which is currently to my right.\n\nI need to be cautious of the enemy's possible moves, but since I don't know its behavior, I'll assume it will try to eat apples as well.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my path, I think going left to (7,6) is the way to go.\n\nAfter that, I'll assess the situation again.\n\nSo, my decision for this turn is to move left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{LEFT}} \\]"

There are apples at (8,4), (6,8), (9,1), (4,1), and (7,6). Enemy snake number 1 is at (9,7) with no body parts listed, so it's just its head at (9,7).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . 2 1\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . .

Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-turn game, I need to think about a strategy that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence, not just one.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate surroundings.\n\nI'm at (8,7). Possible moves:\n\n- Up: (8,8)\n\n- Down: (8,6)\n\n- Left: (7,7)\n\n- Right: (9,7), but that's where snake 1 is, so that's a bad idea.\n\nSo, right away, moving right is out of the question because it's occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nLet's look at the apples and see which one is closest or which path allows me to pick up multiple apples.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (8,4). That's directly down from my current position. I'd have to move down three rows to get to it.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (6,8) is two rows up and two columns to the left.\n\nThe apple at (9,1) is down six rows and one column to the right, but that's where the enemy snake is heading possibly.\n\nThe apple at (4,1) is down three rows and seven columns to the left.\n\nThe apple at (7,6) is down one row and one column to the left.\n\nHmm.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (8,4), which is directly down.\n\nBut to get there, I need to move down three rows: from row 7 to row 4, column 8.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear and that no snakes are in my way.\n\nLooking at the board, between row 7 and row 4, column 8, there are no obstacles listed. So it seems safe.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, and then I can consider going for another apple.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (9,7), which is right next to me. If I move down, it might move as well.\n\nI need to consider its possible movements.\n\nAssuming snake 1 is also trying to eat apples and avoid me, I need to predict its moves.\n\nBut since I don't have information about its body or its past moves, it's hard to predict.\n\nPerhaps it will go for the apple at (9,1), which is down six rows from its position.\n\nBut that's just speculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it will try to block me or something.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe I should consider a different apple.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6,8), which is two rows up and two columns to the left.\n\nTo get there, I need to move up to (8,8), then left to (7,8), then left to (6,8).\n\nBut wait, looking at the board, row 8, column 8 is empty.\n\nThen left to (7,8), which is also empty.\n\nThen left to (6,8), which has an apple.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend.\n\nI need to make sure that in the process, I don't run into myself or any walls.\n\nAlso, I need to consider snake 1's possible moves.\n\nIf I move up to (8,8), snake 1 might move up to (9,8), but I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, it might stay put or move elsewhere.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (7,6), which is down one row and left one column.\n\nSo, down to (8,6), but that's not correct. Wait, down from (8,7) to (8,6), but the apple is at (7,6). So, actually, left to (7,7), then down to (7,6).\n\nWait, no. My current position is (8,7). To get to (7,6), I need to move left to (7,7), then down to (7,6).\n\nBut looking at the board, (7,7) is empty, and (7,6) has an apple.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend.\n\nThen, I could consider going for another apple.\n\nThis seems like a shorter path compared to going for (8,4), which is three rows down.\n\nMoreover, going down three rows might put me in the path of snake 1, which is at (9,7).\n\nSnake 1 could potentially move down towards (9,6), (9,5), etc., possibly intercepting my path if I go down.\n\nWhereas going left and down seems less likely to encounter snake 1 immediately.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nLet me map out the steps.\n\nOption 2: Go for apple at (7,6).\n\nMove left to (7,7). Then down to (7,6).\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,6), I can consider my next move.\n\nFrom (7,6), possible moves:\n\n- Up to (7,7), but that's where I just came from, which is now part of my body, so can't go there.\n\n- Down to (7,5)\n\n- Left to (6,6)\n\n- Right to (8,6)\n\nI need to see which of these directions leads to an apple or a path to an apple.\n\nLooking at the board, none of these immediate positions have apples.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (7,6), I need to decide where to go next.\n\nOption 3: Go for apple at (6,8).\n\nAs previously considered, up to (8,8), then left to (7,8), then left to (6,8).\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would be at (6,8), and possible moves:\n\n- Up to (6,9)\n\n- Down to (6,7)\n\n- Left to (5,8)\n\n- Right to (7,8)\n\nAgain, no immediate apples there.\n\nI need to think about which path allows me to pick up the most apples with the least risk.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (4,1), which is further away, but it might be worth it if I can pick up multiple apples along the way.\n\nBut that seems too distant and risky, given the board size and the presence of the enemy snake.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (9,1), which is closer.\n\nBut that's at (9,1), which is down six rows from my current position.\n\nTo get there from (8,7), I would need to move down to (8,1), then right to (9,1).\n\nBut that involves passing by snake 1, which is at (9,7).\n\nIf snake 1 moves down, it might intercept my path.\n\nThis seems risky.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for the apple at (8,4), which is directly down from my position.\n\nTo get there, I need to move down three rows: from (8,7) to (8,4).\n\nLet's see the path:\n\n- Down to (8,6)\n\n- Down to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8,4)\n\nLooking at the board, between row 7 and row 4, column 8 seems clear.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (8,4), I would be at (8,4), and possible moves:\n\n- Up to (8,5)\n\n- Down to (8"

So, I'm somewhere in the middle-ish.\n\nThere are apples at (8,4), (6,8), (9,1), (4,1), and (7,6). That's five apples to potentially go for.\n\nAlso, there's an enemy snake at (9,6), right next to me. I need to be careful not to bump into it.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board.

If I move right, I'll bump into it and die. So, right is out.\n\nMoving left to (7,6) seems safe. Let's see: is there anything there? It looks empty. After moving left, I'd be at (7,6), which has an apple. So, I eat the apple, grow, and get a point.\n\nBut, I need to think about what happens after that. After eating the apple at (7,6), where do I go next?\n\nFrom (7,6), I can move up, down, left, or right.\n\n- Up to (7,7): let's see, is that safe? It's empty, looks okay.\n\n- Down to (7,5): also empty.\n\n- Left to (6,6): empty.\n\n- Right to (8,6): but that's where I just came from, which is now part of my body, so I can't go back there immediately.\n\nSo, from (7,6), moving up to (7,7) seems safe.\n\nThen, from (7,7), I can continue up to (7,8), and maybe aim for the apple at (6,8). That's a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, from (7,6), I could move left to (6,6), but there's no apple there, and I'm not sure what's beyond.\n\nWait, but the apple at (6,8) is up and to the left. Maybe aiming for that after eating the one at (7,6).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (8,4), which is directly down from my current position.\n\nLet's think about that.\n\nIf I move down from (8,6) to (8,5), then to (8,4), where there's an apple.\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to make sure the path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, between (8,6) and (8,4), it's open. So, I can move down to (8,5), then to (8,4), eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,6), which is directly to my right.\n\nIf I move down, the enemy might also move down and intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, the enemy might move up or stay put.\n\nI don't know its behavior, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (7,6) first, since it's right next to me, and then decide.\n\nAlso, considering that moving left to (7,6) is straightforward, and there's an apple there.\n\nAfter eating it, I can grow, and then maybe aim for another apple.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move left to (7,6), eat apple, grow.\n\n2. From (7,6), move up to (7,7).\n\n3. Then, move up to (7,8).\n\n4. Then, left to (6,8), eat apple.\n\nThat seems like a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (7,6), I could move down to (7,5), but there's no apple there, and I might get too close to the bottom where there's another apple at (4,1), but that seems too far away right now.\n\nSimilarly, moving left from (7,6) to (6,6) doesn't lead directly to an apple.\n\nSo, moving up seems the best option after eating (7,6).\n\nAnother consideration is that the enemy is at (9,6). If I move left to (7,6), the enemy might move left or down, but I'm not sure.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't get cornered.\n\nBut for now, moving left to (7,6) seems safe, and I can assess the situation from there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (6,8).\n\nTo do that, I'd need to move up to (8,7), then left to (7,7), then left to (6,7), then up to (6,8).\n\nThat's a longer path, and I need to make sure the enemy doesn't interfere.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for the closer apple at (7,6) is better.\n\nWait, but (7,6) is directly left of my current position, and it's an easy pick.\n\nAfter eating it, I can decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet me consider the apple at (8,4), which is directly down.\n\nTo get there, I'd need to move down from (8,6) to (8,5), then to (8,4).\n\nBut, that's two moves down, and I need to make sure the path is clear.\n\nAlso, the enemy is at (9,6), which is below me.\n\nIf the enemy moves down, it might block my path.\n\nWhereas going left to (7,6) is a safer option, as the enemy is to my right, and it would have to move left to interfere with me, which might not be its priority.\n\nAdditionally, after eating (7,6), I can aim for (6,8), which is up and left.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n- Move left to (7,6): eat apple, grow.\n\n- Move up to (7,7).\n\n- Move up to (7,8).\n\n- Move left to (6,8): eat apple.\n\nThat's four moves to get two apples.\n\nAlternatively, going down to (8,4):\n\n- Move down to (8,5).\n\n- Move down to (8,4): eat apple.\n\nThat's only two moves for one apple.\n\nSo, in terms of efficiency, going for (7,6) and then (6,8) allows me to get two apples in four moves, whereas going for (8,4) gets me one apple in two moves.\n\nTherefore, going left to (7,6) and then up to (7,7), up to (7,8), left to (6,8) seems like a better strategy in terms of points per move.\n\nAlso, it keeps me away from the enemy, which is currently to my right.\n\nI need to be cautious of the enemy's possible moves, but since I don't know its behavior, I'll assume it will try to eat apples as well.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my path, I think going left to (7,6) is the way to go.\n\nAfter that, I'll assess the situation again.\n\nSo, my decision for this turn is to move left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{LEFT}} \\]"

The apples are at (8,4), (6,8), (9,1), (4,1), and (2,8). There's also an enemy snake at (9,8).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher y-coordinates are upwards, and higher x-coordinates are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- Row 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 8: . . A . . . A . . .\n\n- Row 7: . . . . . . . . . 1\n\n- Row 6: . . . . . . . 2 T .\n\n- Row 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\n- Row 4: . . . . . . . .

Wait, there seems to be a confusion here.\n\nIn the board state, '2 T' is at (7,6), which is row 7, column 6. So, my snake is at (7,6), not (6,6). I need to clarify that.\n\nLet me correct that: my snake is at (7,6), and I need to make a move from there.\n\nNow, looking at the possible moves:\n\n- Up: (7,7)\n\n- Down: (7,5)\n\n- Left: (6,6)\n\n- Right: (8,6)\n\nI need to decide which direction to go based on the positions of the apples and the enemy snake.\n\nFirst, let's see the positions of the apples relative to my current position:\n\n- (8,4): right and down\n\n- (6,8): left and up\n\n- (9,1): right and down\n\n- (4,1): left and down\n\n- (2,8): left and up\n\nSo, apples are spread out in different directions.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (9,8). I need to be careful not to collide with it.\n\nLet me consider each possible move:\n\n1. Up: (7,7)\n\n- Is there an apple there? No, but moving up could lead me towards apples at (6,8) and (2,8).\n\n- I need to check if the path is clear.\n\n2. Down: (7,5)\n\n- Moving down could lead me towards apples at (8,4) and (9,1), but that's also where the enemy snake might be.\n\n- The enemy is at (9,8), so it might move down or left.\n\n3. Left: (6,6)\n\n- Moving left towards (6,6), which is empty.\n\n- From there, I can continue left towards (5,6), etc., potentially towards apples at (4,1) or (2,8).\n\n4. Right: (8,6)\n\n- Moving right towards (8,6), which is empty.\n\n- From there, I can continue right towards (9,6), but the enemy is at (9,8), so I need to be cautious.\n\nI need to think about which direction leads me closest to an apple without putting me in harm's way.\n\nLet me consider the apple at (6,8). To get there from (7,6):\n\n- Move left to (6,6)\n\n- Then up to (6,7)\n\n- Then up to (6,8)\n\nThat seems like a straightforward path, and there don't seem to be any immediate threats in that direction.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) would require me to move right to (8,6), then down to (8,5), then down to (8,4). But that takes me closer to the enemy snake, which is at (9,8).\n\nSimilarly, moving towards (9,1) would involve moving right and down, again approaching the enemy.\n\nThe apples at (4,1) and (2,8) are further away, and moving towards them might not be the most efficient use of my turns, especially since there are closer apples available.\n\nTherefore, I think the best approach is to go for the apple at (6,8) first, as it's relatively close and in a safe direction.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move left to (6,6).\n\nThen, next turn, I can move up to (6,7), and then up again to (6,8) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll have grown, so I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a spot where my own body is.\n\nBut for now, moving left seems like the safest and most strategic move.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{LEFT}} \\]"

The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . .

Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-turn game, I need to think about a strategy that allows me to eat multiple apples in sequence, not just one.\n\nFirst, let's consider the immediate surroundings.\n\nI'm at (8,7). Possible moves:\n\n- Up: (8,8)\n\n- Down: (8,6)\n\n- Left: (7,7)\n\n- Right: (9,7), but that's where snake 1 is, so that's a bad idea.\n\nSo, right away, moving right is out of the question because it's occupied by the enemy snake.\n\nLet's look at the apples and see which one is closest or which path allows me to pick up multiple apples.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (8,4). That's directly down from my current position. I'd have to move down three rows to get to it.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (6,8) is two rows up and two columns to the left.\n\nThe apple at (9,1) is down six rows and one column to the right, but that's where the enemy snake is heading possibly.\n\nThe apple at (4,1) is down three rows and seven columns to the left.\n\nThe apple at (7,6) is down one row and one column to the left.\n\nHmm.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first.\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (8,4), which is directly down.\n\nBut to get there, I need to move down three rows: from row 7 to row 4, column 8.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear and that no snakes are in my way.\n\nLooking at the board, between row 7 and row 4, column 8, there are no obstacles listed. So it seems safe.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, and then I can consider going for another apple.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy snake's possible moves.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (9,7), which is right next to me. If I move down, it might move as well.\n\nI need to consider its possible movements.\n\nAssuming snake 1 is also trying to eat apples and avoid me, I need to predict its moves.\n\nBut since I don't have information about its body or its past moves, it's hard to predict.\n\nPerhaps it will go for the apple at (9,1), which is down six rows from its position.\n\nBut that's just speculation.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it will try to block me or something.\n\nGiven the uncertainty, maybe I should consider a different apple.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6,8), which is two rows up and two columns to the left.\n\nTo get there, I need to move up to (8,8), then left to (7,8), then left to (6,8).\n\nBut wait, looking at the board, row 8, column 8 is empty.\n\nThen left to (7,8), which is also empty.\n\nThen left to (6,8), which has an apple.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend.\n\nI need to make sure that in the process, I don't run into myself or any walls.\n\nAlso, I need to consider snake 1's possible moves.\n\nIf I move up to (8,8), snake 1 might move up to (9,8), but I don't know.\n\nAlternatively, it might stay put or move elsewhere.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (7,6), which is down one row and left one column.\n\nSo, down to (8,6), but that's not correct. Wait, down from (8,7) to (8,6), but the apple is at (7,6). So, actually, left to (7,7), then down to (7,6).\n\nWait, no. My current position is (8,7). To get to (7,6), I need to move left to (7,7), then down to (7,6).\n\nBut looking at the board, (7,7) is empty, and (7,6) has an apple.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend.\n\nThen, I could consider going for another apple.\n\nThis seems like a shorter path compared to going for (8,4), which is three rows down.\n\nMoreover, going down three rows might put me in the path of snake 1, which is at (9,7).\n\nSnake 1 could potentially move down towards (9,6), (9,5), etc., possibly intercepting my path if I go down.\n\nWhereas going left and down seems less likely to encounter snake 1 immediately.\n\nBut I need to think ahead.\n\nLet me map out the steps.\n\nOption 2: Go for apple at (7,6).\n\nMove left to (7,7).

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (8,6), which is on the grid where X ranges from 0 to 9 and Y from 0 to 9, with (0,0) being the bottom left and (9,9) the top right. So, I'm somewhere in the middle-ish.\n\nThere are apples at (8,4), (6,8), (9,1), (4,1), and (7,6). That's five apples to potentially go for.\n\nAlso, there's an enemy snake at (9,6), right next to me. I need to be careful not to bump into it.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board. Here's what it looks like:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . .

A\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, S is me at (8,6), E is the enemy at (9,6), and A are the apples.\n\nOkay, I need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, moving right is risky because the enemy is right there at (9,6). If I move right, I'll bump into it and die. So, right is out.\n\nMoving left to (7,6) seems safe. Let's see: is there anything there? It looks empty. After moving left, I'd be at (7,6), which has an apple. So, I eat the apple, grow, and get a point.\n\nBut, I need to think about what happens after that. After eating the apple at (7,6), where do I go next?\n\nFrom (7,6), I can move up, down, left, or right.\n\n- Up to (7,7): let's see, is that safe? It's empty, looks okay.\n\n- Down to (7,5): also empty.\n\n- Left to (6,6): empty.\n\n- Right to (8,6): but that's where I just came from, which is now part of my body, so I can't go back there immediately.\n\nSo, from (7,6), moving up to (7,7) seems safe.\n\nThen, from (7,7), I can continue up to (7,8), and maybe aim for the apple at (6,8). That's a possibility.\n\nAlternatively, from (7,6), I could move left to (6,6), but there's no apple there, and I'm not sure what's beyond.\n\nWait, but the apple at (6,8) is up and to the left. Maybe aiming for that after eating the one at (7,6).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (8,4), which is directly down from my current position.\n\nLet's think about that.\n\nIf I move down from (8,6) to (8,5), then to (8,4), where there's an apple.\n\nThat seems straightforward, but I need to make sure the path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, between (8,6) and (8,4), it's open. So, I can move down to (8,5), then to (8,4), eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,6), which is directly to my right.\n\nIf I move down, the enemy might also move down and intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, the enemy might move up or stay put.\n\nI don't know its behavior, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for the apple at (7,6) first, since it's right next to me, and then decide.\n\nAlso, considering that moving left to (7,6) is straightforward, and there's an apple there.\n\nAfter eating it, I can grow, and then maybe aim for another apple.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Move left to (7,6), eat apple, grow.\n\n2. From (7,6), move up to (7,7).\n\n3. Then, move up to (7,8).\n\n4. Then, left to (6,8), eat apple.\n\nThat seems like a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (7,6), I could move down to (7,5), but there's no apple there, and I might get too close to the bottom where there's another apple at (4,1), but that seems too far away right now.\n\nSimilarly, moving left from (7,6) to (6,6) doesn't lead directly to an apple.\n\nSo, moving up seems the best option after eating (7,6).\n\nAnother consideration is that the enemy is at (9,6). If I move left to (7,6), the enemy might move left or down, but I'm not sure.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't get cornered.\n\nBut for now, moving left to (7,6) seems safe, and I can assess the situation from there.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apple at (6,8).\n\nTo do that, I'd need to move up to (8,7), then left to (7,7), then left to (6,7), then up to (6,8).\n\nThat's a longer path, and I need to make sure the enemy doesn't interfere.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for the closer apple at (7,6) is better.\n\nWait, but (7,6) is directly left of my current position, and it's an easy pick.\n\nAfter eating it, I can decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet me consider the apple at (8,4), which is directly down.\n\nTo get there, I'd need to move down from (8,6) to (8,5), then to (8,4).\n\nBut, that's two moves down, and I need to make sure the path is clear.\n\nAlso, the enemy is at (9,6), which is below me.\n\nIf the enemy moves down, it might block my path.\n\nWhereas going left to (7,6) is a safer option, as the enemy is to my right, and it would have to move left to interfere with me, which might not be its priority.\n\nAdditionally, after eating (7,6), I can aim for (6,8), which is up and left.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n- Move left to (7,6): eat apple, grow.\n\n- Move up to (7,7).\n\n- Move up to (7,8).\n\n- Move left to (6,8): eat apple.\n\nThat's four moves to get two apples.\n\nAlternatively, going down to (8,4):\n\n- Move down to (8,5).\n\n- Move down to (8,4): eat apple.\n\nThat's only two moves for one apple.\n\nSo, in terms of efficiency, going for (7,6) and then (6,8) allows me to get two apples in four moves, whereas going for (8,4) gets me one apple in two moves.\n\nTherefore, going left to (7,6) and then up to (7,7), up to (7,8), left to (6,8) seems like a better strategy in terms of points per move.\n\nAlso, it keeps me away from the enemy, which is currently to my right.\n\nI need to be cautious of the enemy's possible moves, but since I don't know its behavior, I'll assume it will try to eat apples as well.\n\nBut for now, focusing on my path, I think going left to (7,6) is the way to go.\n\nAfter that, I'll assess the situation again.\n\nSo, my decision for this turn is to move left.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{LEFT}} \\]"

Down: (5,5)\n\n- Moving down could lead me towards apples at (8,4) and (9,1), but that's also where the enemy snake might be.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,8), so it might move down or left.\n\n3. Left: (4,6)\n\n- Moving left towards (4,6), which is empty.\n\n- From there, I can continue left towards (3,6), etc., potentially towards apples at (4,1) or (2,8).\n\n4. Right: (6,6)\n\n- Moving right towards (6,6), which is empty.\n\n- From there, I can continue right towards (7,6), (8,6), etc., towards apples at (8,4) or (9,1).\n\nI need to think about which direction leads me closest to an apple without putting me in harm's way.\n\nLet me consider the apple at (6,8). To get there from (5,6):\n\n- Move right to (6,6)\n\n- Then up to (6,7)\n\n- Then up to (6,8)\n\nThat seems like a straightforward path, and there don't seem to be any immediate threats in that direction.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (8,4) would require me to move right to (6,6), then right to (7,6), then right to (8,6), then down to (8,5), then down to (8,4). That's a longer path and takes me closer to the enemy snake at (8,8).\n\nSimilarly, moving towards (9,1) would involve moving right and down, again approaching the enemy.\n\nThe apples at (4,1) and (2,8) are further away, and moving towards them might not be the most efficient use of my turns, especially since there are closer apples available.\n\nTherefore, I think the best approach is to go for the apple at (6,8) first, as it's relatively close and in a safe direction.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move right to (6,6).\n\nThen, next turn, I can move up to (6,7), and then up again to (6,8) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll have grown, so I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a spot where my own body is.\n\nBut for now, moving right seems like the safest and most strategic move.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{RIGHT}} \\]"
