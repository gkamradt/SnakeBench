Snake #1 is currently at (2, 6) and moving in a direction that won't interfere with me getting the apple at (8, 0). \n\nAfter getting the apple at (8, 0), I'll have a decision to make. I could either go for the apple at (1, 6) or (3, 0). Going for the apple at (1, 6) might be risky since Snake #1 is in that general direction, so I'll probably go for the apple at (3, 0) next. \n\nHowever, I should also consider that Snake #1 might go for the apple at (2, 1) after I get the apple at (8, 0). If that happens, I'll need to be careful not to run into Snake #1. \n\nWith all that in mind, my next move will be:\n\nDOWN\n\nNext turn strategy: After getting the apple at (8, 0), be cautious of Snake #1's movements and adjust accordingly."
