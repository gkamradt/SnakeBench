            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,2). There are apples at (6,0), (7,1), (5,2), (1,6), and (8,8). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should look at the board and see where everything is. The board is labeled with coordinates, starting from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nLet me plot my position and the apples:\n\n- Me: (8,2)\n\n- Apples: (6,0), (7,1), (5,2), (1,6), (8,8)\n\nI also need to be aware of the enemy snakes. There's Snake #1 at (4,9) with no body parts listed, so probably just the head. That means its body is empty, so it's just the head at (4,9).\n\nNow, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, so I should choose the one that's closest or that makes the most sense strategically.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (8,2):\n\n- To (6,0): |8-6| + |2-0| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (7,1): |8-7| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- To (5,2): |8-5| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- To (1,6): |8-1| + |2-6| = 7 + 4 = 11\n\n- To (8,8): |8-8| + |2-8| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,1), with a distance of 2.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of other snakes and the path to each apple.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- At (7,1), there's an apple, and it's close. But I need to see what's between me and the apple.\n\n- From (8,2), to get to (7,1), I can move left to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\n- But wait, is (7,2) occupied by anything? Let's check the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . 2 .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nSo, row 2, column 7 is empty, as it's between my head at (8,2) and the apple at (7,1).\n\nSimilarly, row 1, column 7 has the apple.\n\nSeems clear.\n\nBut I should also consider if there are any dangers along the path.\n\nEnemy snake is at (4,9), which is up and to the left, and it's head only, so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nSo, moving left to (7,2) should be safe.\n\nThen down to (7,1) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut since I'm just moving two steps, and assuming I don't have any body parts yet, my tail will just move forward.\n\nWait, the board shows my position at (8,2) as 2, and no other body parts mentioned, so I'm probably just the head for now.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (7,1), my body will extend, but since I'm only moving two steps, and no previous body parts, my tail will just move forward.\n\nTherefore, it should be safe.\n\nBut let's think about the bigger picture.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,1), I'll have grown, and then I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (6,0), (5,2), (1,6), (8,8).\n\nFrom (7,1), the closest apple is (6,0), distance |7-6| + |1-0| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nThen (5,2): |7-5| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n(1,6): |7-1| + |1-6| = 6 + 5 = 11.\n\n(8,8): |7-8| + |1-8| = 1 + 7 = 8.\n\nSo, the next closest is (6,0).\n\nBut again, I need to consider the path.\n\nFrom (7,1) to (6,0):\n\n- Left to (6,1), then down to (6,0).\n\n- Or down to (7,0), then left to (6,0).\n\nWait, but (7,0) is outside the board because y=0 is the bottom row.\n\nWait, no, y=0 is the bottom row, so (7,0) is valid.\n\nBut looking at the board, row 0 has an apple at (6,0).\n\nSo, from (7,1), I can move down to (7,0), then left to (6,0).\n\nBut I need to make sure that (7,0) is empty.\n\nFrom the board, row 0: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nSo, column 6 has the apple, column 7 is empty.\n\nTherefore, (7,0) is empty, so moving down to (7,0) is safe, then left to (6,0).\n\nBut wait, I need to consider that after eating the first apple at (7,1), I'll have grown, so I have a body part at (8,2).\n\nThen, moving down to (7,0), I need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, from (7,1), moving down to (7,0), my tail is at (8,2).\n\nSo, as I move, my body follows, so (8,2) moves to (7,1), and my head moves to (7,0).\n\nSo, it should be fine.\n\nThen, from (7,0), move left to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, from (7,1), I could move left to (6,1), then down to (6,0).\n\nBut (6,1) is empty, as per the board.\n\nSo, that's also a option.\n\nMaybe that's safer.\n\nBut, I need to think about the enemy snake.\n\nSnake #1 is at (4,9), and it's possible it's moving towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to anticipate its movement.\n\nBut since I don't know its direction or intelligence, I'll assume it's moving randomly or trying to eat apples as well.\n\nSo, I need to try to avoid running into it.\n\nGiven that, perhaps focusing on the apples that are farther away from it might be safer.\n\nFor example, the apple at (8,8) is far from Snake #1's position at (4,9), especially if it's moving downwards.\n\nBut, (8,8) is relatively far from my current position at (8,2), with a distance of 6.\n\nWhile the apple at (7,1) is closer, with a distance of 2.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to go for the closer apples first to minimize exposure to the enemy.\n\nAlso, considering that the apple at (7,1) is closer, and the path seems clear, I might proceed with that.\n\nBut, I should also think about the long-term plan.\n\nAfter eating (7,1) and (6,0), the next closest apple is (5,2), which is distance 3 from (6,0).\n\nFrom (6,0), to (5,2): |6-5| + |0-2| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nPath would be up to (6,1), then up to (6,2), then left to (5,2).\n\nAlternatively, left to (5,0), then up to (5,2).\n\nBut the first path seems shorter.\n\nBut, again, I need to check if these positions are occupied.\n\nAssuming no other snakes are in these positions, it should be fine.\n\nThen, after (5,2), the next apple is (1,6), which is distance |5-1| + |2-6| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, (8,8) is |5-8| + |2-8| = 3 + 6 = 9.\n\nSo, (1,6) is closer.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance.\n\nI need to think about whether it's worth going for (1,6) next or (8,8).\n\nGiven that (1,6) is closer, maybe I should go for that.\n\nBut, considering the enemy snake is at (4,9), which is closer to (1,6) than to (8,8).\n\nSo, perhaps going for (8,8) would be safer, avoiding confrontation with the"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,2). There are apples at (6,0), (7,1), (5,2), (1,6), and (8,8). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should look at the board and see where everything is. The board is labeled with coordinates, starting from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nLet me plot my position and the apples:\n\n- Me: (8,2)\n\n- Apples: (6,0), (7,1), (5,2), (1,6), (8,8)\n\nI also need to be aware of the enemy snakes. There's Snake #1 at (4,9) with no body parts listed, so probably just the head. That means its body is empty, so it's just the head at (4,9).\n\nNow, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, so I should choose the one that's closest or that makes the most sense strategically.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (8,2):\n\n- To (6,0): |8-6| + |2-0| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (7,1): |8-7| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- To (5,2): |8-5| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- To (1,6): |8-1| + |2-6| = 7 + 4 = 11\n\n- To (8,8): |8-8| + |2-8| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,1), with a distance of 2.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of other snakes and the path to each apple.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- At (7,1), there's an apple, and it's close. But I need to see what's between me and the apple.\n\n- From (8,2), to get to (7,1), I can move left to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\n- But wait, is (7,2) occupied by anything? Let's check the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . 2 .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nSo, row 2, column 7 is empty, as it's between my head at (8,2) and the apple at (7,1).\n\nSimilarly, row 1, column 7 has the apple.\n\nSeems clear.\n\nBut I should also consider if there are any dangers along the path.\n\nEnemy snake is at (4,9), which is up and to the left, and it's head only, so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nSo, moving left to (7,2) should be safe.\n\nThen down to (7,1) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut since I'm just moving two steps, and assuming I don't have any body parts yet, my tail will just move forward.\n\nWait, the board shows my position at (8,2) as 2, and no other body parts mentioned, so I'm probably just the head for now.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (7,1), my body will extend, but since I'm only moving two steps, and no previous body parts, my tail will just move forward.\n\nTherefore, it should be safe.\n\nBut let's think about the bigger picture.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,1), I'll have grown, and then I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (6,0), (5,2), (1,6), (8,8).\n\nFrom (7,1), the closest apple is (6,0), distance |7-6| + |1-0| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nThen (5,2): |7-5| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n(1,6): |7-1| + |1-6| = 6 + 5 = 11.\n\n(8,8): |7-8| + |1-8| = 1 + 7 = 8.\n\nSo, the next closest is (6,0).\n\nBut again, I need to consider the path.\n\nFrom (7,1) to (6,0):\n\n- Left to (6,1), then down to (6,0).\n\n- Or down to (7,0), then left to (6,0).\n\nWait, but (7,0) is outside the board because y=0 is the bottom row.\n\nWait, no, y=0 is the bottom row, so (7,0) is valid.\n\nBut looking at the board, row 0 has an apple at (6,0).\n\nSo, from (7,1), I can move down to (7,0), then left to (6,0).\n\nBut I need to make sure that (7,0) is empty.\n\nFrom the board, row 0: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nSo, column 6 has the apple, column 7 is empty.\n\nTherefore, (7,0) is empty, so moving down to (7,0) is safe, then left to (6,0).\n\nBut wait, I need to consider that after eating the first apple at (7,1), I'll have grown, so I have a body part at (8,2).\n\nThen, moving down to (7,0), I need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, from (7,1), moving down to (7,0), my tail is at (8,2).\n\nSo, as I move, my body follows, so (8,2) moves to (7,1), and my head moves to (7,0).\n\nSo, it should be fine.\n\nThen, from (7,0), move left to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, from (7,1), I could move left to (6,1), then down to (6,0).\n\nBut (6,1) is empty, as per the board.\n\nSo, that's also an option.\n\nMaybe that's safer.\n\nBut, I need to think about the enemy snake.\n\nSnake #1 is at (4,9), and it's possible it's moving towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to anticipate its movement.\n\nBut since I don't know its direction or intelligence, I'll assume it's moving randomly or trying to eat apples as well.\n\nSo, I need to try to avoid running into it.\n\nGiven that, perhaps focusing on the apples that are farther away from it might be safer.\n\nFor example, the apple at (8,8) is far from Snake #1's position at (4,9), especially if it's moving downwards.\n\nBut, (8,8) is relatively far from my current position at (8,2), with a distance of 6.\n\nWhile the apple at (7,1) is closer, with a distance of 2.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to go for the closer apples first to minimize exposure to the enemy.\n\nAlso, considering that the apple at (7,1) is closer, and the path seems clear, I might proceed with that.\n\nBut, I should also think about the long-term plan.\n\nAfter eating (7,1) and (6,0), the next closest apple is (5,2), which is distance |6-5| + |0-2| = 1 + 2 = 3 from (6,0).\n\nFrom (6,0), to (5,2): |6-5| + |0-2| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nPath would be up to (6,1), then up to (6,2), then left to (5,2).\n\nAlternatively, left to (5,0), then up to (5,2).\n\nBut the first path seems shorter.\n\nBut, again, I need to check if these positions are occupied.\n\nAssuming no other snakes are in these positions, it should be fine.\n\nThen, after (5,2), the next apple is (1,6), which is distance |5-1| + |2-6| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, (8,8) is |5-8| + |2-8| = 3 + 6 = 9.\n\nSo, (1,6) is closer.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance.\n\nI need to think about whether it's worth going for (1,6) next or (8,8).\n\nGiven that (1,6) is closer, maybe I should go for that.\n\nBut, considering the enemy snake is at (4,9), which is closer to (1,6) than to (8,8).\n\nSo, perhaps going for"

There are no immediate hazards below.\n  \n- It's important to note the positions and potential movements of the enemy snake. Snake #2 at (8, 2) is relatively far from your position, but we should continuously monitor its movement to avoid a future clash.\n  \n- Planning subsequent moves, moving left, right, or up does not immediately benefit as much as moving down since the closest apple is directly below.\n\n- Future strategic consideration might involve moving towards other apples at (1, 6) and (8, 8) depending on the enemy snake's movement and any new apples that may appear.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving DOWN is the safest and most immediately rewarding move.

The apples (6,0), (7,1), and (5,2) are directly downwards but require careful navigation due to snake boundaries and possible future enemy snake moves.\n- Enemy snake #2 is currently at (8,4), and without any additional body, it poses a limited threat unless it moves into a collision path.\n\n**Evaluation of Immediate Options:**\n- **UP**: Increases y-coordinate to (5,9), which is out of bounds. Not a valid move.\n- **DOWN**: Takes the y-coordinate to (5,7), incrementally positioning towards the downward apples.\n- **LEFT**: Reduces x-coordinate to (4,8), where I previously was, bringing no strategic advantage and moving away from nearby apples.\n- **RIGHT**: Takes the x-coordinate to (6,8), making headway toward the apple at (8,8) which is diagonally upwards. It also positions favorably against the enemy snake, ensuring I am not closing in its path which might result in a collision.\n\n**Strategic Considerations for Future:**\n- After moving towards (8,8) and possibly securing that apple, pivoting the strategy towards descending to collect the apples at the bottom half of the board should be considered. This will include careful navigation and potential re-routing based on the movement of snake #2.\n\n**Risks and Mitigations:**\n- As the enemy snake is at (8,4), a direct movement into this column needs monitoring. Being two units above affords some reaction time in case of a direct upward movement by the enemy snake.\n  \n**Final Decision:**\nMoving RIGHT towards (6,8) not only keeps options open for further upward movement to (8,8) but also ensures a strategic positioning that maintains distance from any snake boundaries and enemy movements.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT."

I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should look at the board and see where everything is. The board is labeled with coordinates, starting from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.

This move aligns with the goal of obtaining the nearest apple.\n\n**Strategic Considerations for Future:**\n- If I succeed in reaching and taking the apple at (8,8), subsequent moves should include strategically navigating towards the lower or middle parts of the board to target more apples while maintaining a safe distance from enemy paths and wall borders.\n  \n**Risks and Mitigations:**\n- The enemy snake at (8,5) could move UP to potentially block or challenge my path towards (8,8). I should keep an option to divert or change strategy quickly if this threat becomes immediate.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nMoving RIGHT towards (7,8) is strategic for immediate access to (8,8) and keeps my options open for reacting to the enemy snake's movements or adjusting path based on the next positions of apples.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT."

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,2). There are apples at (6,0), (7,1), (5,2), (1,6), and (8,8). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should look at the board and see where everything is. The board is labeled with coordinates, starting from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nLet me plot my position and the apples:\n\n- Me: (8,2)\n\n- Apples: (6,0), (7,1), (5,2), (1,6), (8,8)\n\nI also need to be aware of the enemy snakes. There's Snake #1 at (5,8) with no body parts listed, so probably just the head. That means its body is empty, so it's just the head at (5,8).\n\nNow, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, so I should choose the one that's closest or that makes the most sense strategically.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (8,2):\n\n- To (6,0): |8-6| + |2-0| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (7,1): |8-7| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- To (5,2): |8-5| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- To (1,6): |8-1| + |2-6| = 7 + 4 = 11\n\n- To (8,8): |8-8| + |2-8| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,1), with a distance of 2.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of other snakes and the path to each apple.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- At (7,1), there's an apple, and it's close. But I need to see what's between me and the apple.\n\n- From (8,2), to get to (7,1), I can move left to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\n- But wait, is (7,2) occupied by anything? Let's check the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . 2 .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nSo, row 2, column 7 is empty, as it's between my head at (8,2) and the apple at (7,1).\n\nSimilarly, row 1, column 7 has the apple.\n\nSeems clear.\n\nBut I should also consider if there are any dangers along the path.\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,8), which is up and to the left, and it's head only, so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nSo, moving left to (7,2) should be safe.\n\nThen down to (7,1) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut since I'm just moving two steps, and assuming I don't have any body parts yet, my tail will just move forward.\n\nWait, the board shows my position at (8,2) as 2, and no other body parts mentioned, so I'm probably just the head for now.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (7,1), my body will extend, but since I'm only moving two steps, and no previous body parts, my tail will just move forward.\n\nTherefore, it should be safe.\n\nBut let's think about the bigger picture.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,1), I'll have grown, and then I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (6,0), (5,2), (1,6), (8,8).\n\nFrom (7,1), the closest apple is (6,0), distance |7-6| + |1-0| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nThen (5,2): |7-5| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n(1,6): |7-1| + |1-6| = 6 + 5 = 11.\n\n(8,8): |7-8| + |1-8| = 1 + 7 = 8.\n\nSo, the next closest is (6,0).\n\nBut again, I need to consider the path.\n\nFrom (7,1) to (6,0):\n\n- Left to (6,1), then down to (6,0).\n\n- Or down to (7,0), then left to (6,0).\n\nWait, but (7,0) is outside the board because y=0 is the bottom row.\n\nWait, no, y=0 is the bottom row, so (7,0) is valid.\n\nBut looking at the board, row 0 has an apple at (6,0).\n\nSo, from (7,1), I can move down to (7,0), then left to (6,0).\n\nBut I need to make sure that (7,0) is empty.\n\nFrom the board, row 0: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nSo, column 6 has the apple, column 7 is empty.\n\nTherefore, (7,0) is empty, so moving down to (7,0) is safe, then left to (6,0).\n\nBut wait, I need to consider that after eating the first apple at (7,1), I'll have grown, so I have a body part at (8,2).\n\nThen, moving down to (7,0), I need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, from (7,1), moving down to (7,0), my tail is at (8,2).\n\nSo, as I move, my body follows, so (8,2) moves to (7,1), and my head moves to (7,0).\n\nSo, it should be fine.\n\nThen, from (7,0), move left to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, from (7,1), I could move left to (6,1), then down to (6,0).\n\nBut (6,1) is empty, as per the board.\n\nSo, that's also an option.\n\nMaybe that's safer.\n\nBut, I need to think about the enemy snake.\n\nSnake #1 is at (5,8), and it's possible it's moving towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to anticipate its movement.\n\nBut since I don't know its direction or intelligence, I'll assume it's moving randomly or trying to eat apples as well.\n\nSo, I need to try to avoid running into it.\n\nGiven that, perhaps focusing on the apples that are farther away from it might be safer.\n\nFor example, the apple at (8,8) is far from Snake #1's position at (5,8), especially if it's moving downwards.\n\nBut, (8,8) is relatively far from my current position at (8,2), with a distance of 6.\n\nWhile the apple at (7,1) is closer, with a distance of 2.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to go for the closer apples first to minimize exposure to the enemy.\n\nAlso, considering that the apple at (7,1) is closer, and the path seems clear, I might proceed with that.\n\nBut, I should also think about the long-term plan.\n\nAfter eating (7,1) and (6,0), the next closest apple is (5,2), which is distance |6-5| + |0-2| = 1 + 2 = 3 from (6,0).\n\nFrom (6,0), to (5,2): |6-5| + |0-2| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nPath would be up to (6,1), then up to (6,2), then left to (5,2).\n\nAlternatively, left to (5,0), then up to (5,2).\n\nBut the first path seems shorter.\n\nBut, again, I need to check if these positions are occupied.\n\nAssuming no other snakes are in these positions, it should be fine.\n\nThen, after (5,2), the next apple is (1,6), which is distance |5-1| + |2-6| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, (8,8) is |5-8| + |2-8| = 3 + 6 = 9.\n\nSo, (1,6) is closer.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance.\n\nI need to think about whether it's worth going for (1,6) next or (8,8).\n\nGiven that (1,6) is closer, maybe I should go for that.\n\nBut, considering the enemy snake is at (5,8), which is closer to (1,6) than to (8,8).\n\nSo, perhaps going for"

There are no immediate hazards below.\n  \n- It's important to note the positions and potential movements of the enemy snake. Snake #2 at (8, 2) is relatively far from your position, but we should continuously monitor its movement to avoid a future clash.\n  \n- Planning subsequent moves, moving left, right, or up does not immediately benefit as much as moving down since the closest apple is directly below.\n\n- Future strategic consideration might involve moving towards other apples at (1, 6) and (8, 8) depending on the enemy snake's movement and any new apples that may appear.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving DOWN is the safest and most immediately rewarding move.

Given that it has no body length shown, it might not directly impact my immediate move but could be a factor soon.\n\n**Evaluation of Movement Options:**\n- **UP**: Increases y-coordinate to (7,9), not fruitful in reaching the nearest apple.\n- **DOWN**: Decreases y-coordinate to (7,7), moving away from the apple at (8, 8).\n- **LEFT**: Decreases x-coordinate to (6,8), opposite direction from the target apple.\n- **RIGHT**: Increases x-coordinate to (8,8), directly toward the apple, aligning perfectly with the immediate objective of obtaining it.\n\n**Strategic considerations and Risks:**\n- The most direct route to capture the nearest apple (8, 8) is a move to the RIGHT. This not only ensures a point but also keeps in line with the most efficient pathing.\n- Whether the enemy snake moves UP to (8,7) poses a future risk, yet for this turn, it should not impact the primary objective. Being ready to adapt to the enemy's movement in subsequent turn(s) is key.\n\n**Final Decision and Strategy for Next Moves:**\nThe optimal move currently is unmistakably to move RIGHT to capture the apple at (8, 8). Following this, if the apple is successfully captured, consideration should be given to navigating towards either remaining apples based on their accessibility and the enemy snake's positioning on the board.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT."

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,2). There are apples at (6,0), (7,1), (5,2), (1,6), and (8,8). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should look at the board and see where everything is. The board is labeled with coordinates, starting from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nLet me plot my position and the apples:\n\n- Me: (8,2)\n\n- Apples: (6,0), (7,1), (5,2), (1,6), (8,8)\n\nI also need to be aware of the enemy snakes. There's Snake #1 at (5,8) with no body parts listed, so probably just the head. That means its body is empty, so it's just the head at (5,8).\n\nNow, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, so I should choose the one that's closest or that makes the most sense strategically.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (8,2):\n\n- To (6,0): |8-6| + |2-0| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (7,1): |8-7| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- To (5,2): |8-5| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- To (1,6): |8-1| + |2-6| = 7 + 4 = 11\n\n- To (8,8): |8-8| + |2-8| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,1), with a distance of 2.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of other snakes and the path to each apple.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- At (7,1), there's an apple, and it's close. But I need to see what's between me and the apple.\n\n- From (8,2), to get to (7,1), I can move left to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\n- But wait, is (7,2) occupied by anything? Let's check the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . 2 .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nSo, row 2, column 7 is empty, as it's between my head at (8,2) and the apple at (7,1).\n\nSimilarly, row 1, column 7 has the apple.\n\nSeems clear.\n\nBut I should also consider if there are any dangers along the path.\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,8), which is up and to the left, and it's head only, so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nSo, moving left to (7,2) should be safe.\n\nThen down to (7,1) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut since I'm just moving two steps, and assuming I don't have any body parts yet, my tail will just move forward.\n\nWait, the board shows my position at (8,2) as 2, and no other body parts mentioned, so I'm probably just the head for now.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (7,1), my body will extend, but since I'm only moving two steps, and no previous body parts, my tail will just move forward.\n\nTherefore, it should be safe.\n\nBut let's think about the bigger picture.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,1), I'll have grown, and then I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (6,0), (5,2), (1,6), (8,8).\n\nFrom (7,1), the closest apple is (6,0), distance |7-6| + |1-0| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nThen (5,2): |7-5| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n(1,6): |7-1| + |1-6| = 6 + 5 = 11.\n\n(8,8): |7-8| + |1-8| = 1 + 7 = 8.\n\nSo, the next closest is (6,0).\n\nBut again, I need to consider the path.\n\nFrom (7,1) to (6,0):\n\n- Left to (6,1), then down to (6,0).\n\n- Or down to (7,0), then left to (6,0).\n\nWait, but (7,0) is outside the board because y=0 is the bottom row.\n\nWait, no, y=0 is the bottom row, so (7,0) is valid.\n\nBut looking at the board, row 0 has an apple at (6,0).\n\nSo, from (7,1), I can move down to (7,0), then left to (6,0).\n\nBut I need to make sure that (7,0) is empty.\n\nFrom the board, row 0: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nSo, column 6 has the apple, column 7 is empty.\n\nTherefore, (7,0) is empty, so moving down to (7,0) is safe, then left to (6,0).\n\nBut wait, I need to consider that after eating the first apple at (7,1), I'll have grown, so I have a body part at (8,2).\n\nThen, moving down to (7,0), I need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, from (7,1), moving down to (7,0), my tail is at (8,2).\n\nSo, as I move, my body follows, so (8,2) moves to (7,1), and my head moves to (7,0).\n\nSo, it should be fine.\n\nThen, from (7,0), move left to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, from (7,1), I could move left to (6,1), then down to (6,0).\n\nBut (6,1) is empty, as per the board.\n\nSo, that's also an option.\n\nMaybe that's safer.\n\nBut, I need to think about the enemy snake.\n\nSnake #1 is at (5,8), and it's possible it's moving towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to anticipate its movement.\n\nBut since I don't know its direction or intelligence, I'll assume it's moving randomly or trying to eat apples as well.\n\nSo, I need to try to avoid running into it.\n\nGiven that, perhaps focusing on the apples that are farther away from it might be safer.\n\nFor example, the apple at (8,8) is far from Snake #1's position at (5,8), especially if it's moving downwards.\n\nBut, (8,8) is relatively far from my current position at (8,2), with a distance of 6.\n\nWhile the apple at (7,1) is closer, with a distance of 2.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to go for the closer apples first to minimize exposure to the enemy.\n\nAlso, considering that the apple at (7,1) is closer, and the path seems clear, I might proceed with that.\n\nBut, I should also think about the long-term plan.\n\nAfter eating (7,1) and (6,0), the next closest apple is (5,2), which is distance |6-5| + |0-2| = 1 + 2 = 3 from (6,0).\n\nFrom (6,0), to (5,2): |6-5| + |0-2| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nPath would be up to (6,1), then up to (6,2), then left to (5,2).\n\nAlternatively, left to (5,0), then up to (5,2).\n\nBut the first path seems shorter.\n\nBut, again, I need to check if these positions are occupied.\n\nAssuming no other snakes are in these positions, it should be fine.\n\nThen, after (5,2), the next apple is (1,6), which is distance |5-1| + |2-6| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, (8,8) is |5-8| + |2-8| = 3 + 6 = 9.\n\nSo, (1,6) is closer.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance.\n\nI need to think about whether it's worth going for (1,6) next or (8,8).\n\nGiven that (1,6) is closer, maybe I should go for that.\n\nBut, considering the enemy snake is at (5,8), which is closer to (1,6) than to (8,8).\n\nSo, perhaps going for"

There are no immediate hazards below.\n  \n- It's important to note the positions and potential movements of the enemy snake. Snake #2 at (8, 2) is relatively far from your position, but we should continuously monitor its movement to avoid a future clash.\n  \n- Planning subsequent moves, moving left, right, or up does not immediately benefit as much as moving down since the closest apple is directly below.\n\n- Future strategic consideration might involve moving towards other apples at (1, 6) and (8, 8) depending on the enemy snake's movement and any new apples that may appear.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nMoving DOWN is the safest and most immediately rewarding move.

Given that it has no body length shown, it might not directly impact my immediate move but could be a factor soon.\n\n**Evaluation of Movement Options:**\n- **UP**: Increases y-coordinate to (7,9), not fruitful in reaching the nearest apple.\n- **DOWN**: Decreases y-coordinate to (7,7), moving away from the apple at (8, 8).\n- **LEFT**: Decreases x-coordinate to (6,8), opposite direction from the target apple.\n- **RIGHT**: Increases x-coordinate to (8,8), directly toward the apple, aligning perfectly with the immediate objective of obtaining it.\n\n**Strategic considerations and Risks:**\n- The most direct route to capture the nearest apple (8, 8) is a move to the RIGHT. This not only ensures a point but also keeps in line with the most efficient pathing.\n- Whether the enemy snake moves UP to (8,7) poses a future risk, yet for this turn, it should not impact the primary objective. Being ready to adapt to the enemy's movement in subsequent turn(s) is key.\n\n**Final Decision and Strategy for Next Moves:**\nThe optimal move currently is unmistakably to move RIGHT to capture the apple at (8, 8). Following this, if the apple is successfully captured, consideration should be given to navigating towards either remaining apples based on their accessibility and the enemy snake's positioning on the board.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT."

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,2). There are apples at (6,0), (7,1), (5,2), (1,6), and (8,8). I need to navigate to these apples to eat them and gain points, but I have to be careful not to run into walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should look at the board and see where everything is. The board is labeled with coordinates, starting from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, moving right increases the x-coordinate, and moving up increases the y-coordinate.\n\nLet me plot my position and the apples:\n\n- Me: (8,2)\n\n- Apples: (6,0), (7,1), (5,2), (1,6), (8,8)\n\nI also need to be aware of the enemy snakes. There's Snake #1 at (5,8) with no body parts listed, so probably just the head. That means its body is empty, so it's just the head at (5,8).\n\nNow, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, so I should choose the one that's closest or that makes the most sense strategically.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (8,2):\n\n- To (6,0): |8-6| + |2-0| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (7,1): |8-7| + |2-1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n- To (5,2): |8-5| + |2-2| = 3 + 0 = 3\n\n- To (1,6): |8-1| + |2-6| = 7 + 4 = 11\n\n- To (8,8): |8-8| + |2-8| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,1), with a distance of 2.\n\nBut I should also consider the positions of other snakes and the path to each apple.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- At (7,1), there's an apple, and it's close. But I need to see what's between me and the apple.\n\n- From (8,2), to get to (7,1), I can move left to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\n- But wait, is (7,2) occupied by anything? Let's check the board.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . 2 .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nSo, row 2, column 7 is empty, as it's between my head at (8,2) and the apple at (7,1).\n\nSimilarly, row 1, column 7 has the apple.\n\nSeems clear.\n\nBut I should also consider if there are any dangers along the path.\n\nEnemy snake is at (5,8), which is up and to the left, and it's head only, so no body parts to worry about yet.\n\nSo, moving left to (7,2) should be safe.\n\nThen down to (7,1) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I'll grow, so my tail will extend.\n\nBut since I'm just moving two steps, and assuming I don't have any body parts yet, my tail will just move forward.\n\nWait, the board shows my position at (8,2) as 2, and no other body parts mentioned, so I'm probably just the head for now.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (7,1), my body will extend, but since I'm only moving two steps, and no previous body parts, my tail will just move forward.\n\nTherefore, it should be safe.\n\nBut let's think about the bigger picture.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,1), I'll have grown, and then I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (6,0), (5,2), (1,6), (8,8).\n\nFrom (7,1), the closest apple is (6,0), distance |7-6| + |1-0| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nThen (5,2): |7-5| + |1-2| = 2 + 1 = 3.\n\n(1,6): |7-1| + |1-6| = 6 + 5 = 11.\n\n(8,8): |7-8| + |1-8| = 1 + 7 = 8.\n\nSo, the next closest is (6,0).\n\nBut again, I need to consider the path.\n\nFrom (7,1) to (6,0):\n\n- Left to (6,1), then down to (6,0).\n\n- Or down to (7,0), then left to (6,0).\n\nWait, but (7,0) is outside the board because y=0 is the bottom row.\n\nWait, no, y=0 is the bottom row, so (7,0) is valid.\n\nBut looking at the board, row 0 has an apple at (6,0).\n\nSo, from (7,1), I can move down to (7,0), then left to (6,0).\n\nBut I need to make sure that (7,0) is empty.\n\nFrom the board, row 0: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nSo, column 6 has the apple, column 7 is empty.\n\nTherefore, (7,0) is empty, so moving down to (7,0) is safe, then left to (6,0).\n\nBut wait, I need to consider that after eating the first apple at (7,1), I'll have grown, so I have a body part at (8,2).\n\nThen, moving down to (7,0), I need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, from (7,1), moving down to (7,0), my tail is at (8,2).\n\nSo, as I move, my body follows, so (8,2) moves to (7,1), and my head moves to (7,0).\n\nSo, it should be fine.\n\nThen, from (7,0), move left to (6,0) to eat the apple.\n\nBut perhaps there's a better path.\n\nAlternatively, from (7,1), I could move left to (6,1), then down to (6,0).\n\nBut (6,1) is empty, as per the board.\n\nSo, that's also an option.\n\nMaybe that's safer.\n\nBut, I need to think about the enemy snake.\n\nSnake #1 is at (5,8), and it's possible it's moving towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to anticipate its movement.\n\nBut since I don't know its direction or intelligence, I'll assume it's moving randomly or trying to eat apples as well.\n\nSo, I need to try to avoid running into it.\n\nGiven that, perhaps focusing on the apples that are farther away from it might be safer.\n\nFor example, the apple at (8,8) is far from Snake #1's position at (5,8), especially if it's moving downwards.\n\nBut, (8,8) is relatively far from my current position at (8,2), with a distance of 6.\n\nWhile the apple at (7,1) is closer, with a distance of 2.\n\nSo, perhaps it's better to go for the closer apples first to minimize exposure to the enemy.\n\nAlso, considering that the apple at (7,1) is closer, and the path seems clear, I might proceed with that.\n\nBut, I should also think about the long-term plan.\n\nAfter eating (7,1) and (6,0), the next closest apple is (5,2), which is distance |6-5| + |0-2| = 1 + 2 = 3 from (6,0).\n\nFrom (6,0), to (5,2): |6-5| + |0-2| = 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nPath would be up to (6,1), then up to (6,2), then left to (5,2).\n\nAlternatively, left to (5,0), then up to (5,2).\n\nBut the first path seems shorter.\n\nBut, again, I need to check if these positions are occupied.\n\nAssuming no other snakes are in these positions, it should be fine.\n\nThen, after (5,2), the next apple is (1,6), which is distance |5-1| + |2-6| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, (8,8) is |5-8| + |2-8| = 3 + 6 = 9.\n\nSo, (1,6) is closer.\n\nBut that's still a considerable distance.\n\nI need to think about whether it's worth going for (1,6) next or (8,8).\n\nGiven that (1,6) is closer, maybe I should go for that.\n\nBut, considering the enemy snake is at (5,8), which is closer to (1,6) than to (8,8).\n\nSo, perhaps going for"

Currently, no strategic gain in moving UP since no apples are in the immediate vicinity on the top.\n- **DOWN:** Moves to (8, 7), a dangerous position as it potentially allows a collision if both our snake and the enemy snake decide to occupy this space.\n- **LEFT:** Moves to (7, 8), moving away from potential conflict with Snake #2 and starts making a path towards other available apples, particularly the ones more central and left.\n- **RIGHT:** Moves to (9, 8) and navigates towards the board's edge with no immediate benefit in terms of apple collection or strategic positioning.\n\n**Strategic Choice and Future Consideration:**\n- **LEFT** is the optimal choice, moving the snake away from the immediate proximity of the enemy and towards a position allowing future movement either down to the central apples or further left for the apple at (1, 6).\n- **Strategy for Next Turns:** Observe the enemy snake's movement while navigating towards the next closest apple.
