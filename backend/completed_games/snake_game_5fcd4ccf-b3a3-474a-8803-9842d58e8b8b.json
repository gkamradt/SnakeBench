Assuming this apple was eaten, the new position of your snake now becomes approximately (2, 5).\n  \n- I'll analyze from your current assumed position (2, 5):\n  - **North Direction**: Moving north positions you towards the distant apple at (8, 9). Although it is far, proceeding upward might align you to eventually venture towards this valuable point.\n  - **South Direction**: Moving down from (2, 5) is free of immediate obstacles, but it does not align you with any immediate apple acquisition.\n  - **East Direction (Right)**: Continuing right doesn't provide immediate benefits since the next nearest apple in that direction (on the x-axis) is at (6, 0) but situated significantly lower, not a feasible short-term target.\n  - **West Direction (Left)**: Moving left would reverse recent gains; thus, it is not strategic.\n\nLooking at apple positioning and current board state:\n- The next close reachable apple after the one potentially eaten at (1, 5) is the apple at (0, 4), considering backward movement isn't optimal.\n- Reaching (8, 9) is a long-term goal but it seems plausible to position yourself through the middle or left section avoiding conflict areas and boundaries.\n\n**Strategy for Next Steps**:\n1. Since directly going upwards towards (8, 9) right now may put me in a narrow vertical path potentially contested by the enemy snake, aiming towards (0, 4) appears safer \u2013 that is aiming upwards but positioning to veer left next.\n2. This move, upwards, aligns with general safety from enemy positions and keeps options open for moving west or continuing north without running into boundary limits.\n\n**Decided next move**: UP.\nAnalyzing surroundings and moving towards less contested areas ensures a safer approach towards other potential points. Ensuring growth and survival in the game remains a priority. Meanwhile, keep evaluating movements and enemy behavior per turn for flexibility in the plan."

However, this path leads towards the apple at (8, 9) in the longer-term.

This area is clear of enemies but doesn't offer positional advantage or resources.\n\n- **RIGHT**: Since the board layout and previous instructions considered the apple at (2, 1) as a target, moving right towards (2, 6) from (1, 6) leads you strategically towards the middle of the board. This move keeps more options open for subsequent turns, allowing access to more of the board and resources.\n\nConsidering the board's resources, enemy positions, and the snake's current situation:\n- The apple at (0, 4) is a possible eventual target. Moving right doesn't head directly towards this apple, but it positions you better for future flexibility in moving either up or down to shift towards the left side of the board if required.\n- The positions of enemy snakes and their potential moves don't impose immediate threats in the directly rightward (or eastward) move.\n\n**Strategy for Next Steps**:\n1. Moving right on this turn is advised to grant more space and options for subsequent moves.\n2. Focus will remain on navigating safely while moving towards apples when they align feasibly with your path.\n3. Keep monitoring positions of enemy snakes to avoid unexpected traps or being cornered.\n\n**Decided next move**: RIGHT.\nThis aims to optimize your position, maintain flexibility, and pursue the nearest possible apple by navigating through more favorable pathways."

Although it is far, proceeding upward might align you to eventually venture towards this valuable point.\n  - **South Direction**: Moving down from (2, 5) is free of immediate obstacles, but it does not align you with any immediate apple acquisition.\n  - **East Direction (Right)**: Continuing right doesn't provide immediate benefits since the next nearest apple in that direction (on the x-axis) is at (6, 0) but situated significantly lower, not a feasible short-term target.\n  - **West Direction (Left)**: Moving left would reverse recent gains; thus, it is not strategic.\n\nLooking at apple positioning and current board state:\n- The next close reachable apple after the one potentially eaten at (1, 5) is the apple at (0, 4), considering backward movement isn't optimal.\n- Reaching (8, 9) is a long-term goal but it seems plausible to position yourself through the middle or left section avoiding conflict areas and boundaries.\n\n**Strategy for Next Steps**:\n1.

            "rationale": "Current board state assessment:\n- Our snake (ID 2) has successfully moved up to position (4, 5), and we still have a tail at (4, 4).\n- The closest apple is now just one step away at (0, 4).\n- The enemy snake (ID 1) is currently at (3, 6) with its body at [(2, 6)], still moving towards the right and away from us.\n\nThoughts:\nWe are in an excellent position to consume the apple at (0, 4) on our next move. After consuming this apple, we should have enough length to safely navigate towards the apple at (0, 0) while avoiding potential collisions with the enemy snake or our own body.\n\nThe enemy snake continues to move away from us, which gives us more flexibility in our movement. However, we should still be cautious and keep an eye on its position in case it turns around or becomes a threat later on.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\n- Move up to consume the apple at (0, 4) and grow in length.\n- After consuming the apple, reassess the board state and the enemy snake's position.\n- If the path to the apple at (0, 0) remains safe, prioritize moving in that direction.\n- Keep the apple at (8, 9) as a backup option if the situation changes and moving towards (0, 0) becomes too risky.\n\nMove: UP"
