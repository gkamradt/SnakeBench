The key focus is to move toward the cluster of apples while maintaining a safe trajectory.\n\n**Apple Locations & Proximity**:\n- The closest apples are at (2, 3) and (2, 2), which remain in the southeast direction.\n- Additional apples are located at (2, 0), (3, 0), and (0, 3).\n\n**Enemy Snake Consideration**:\n- Snake #2 is at (3, 6) with its body trailing at (4, 6). The goal is to ensure movements keep a safe distance from this snake and avoid potential collision.\n\n**Current Options**:\n1. **UP (3, 10)**: This move is not possible as it would take me out of bounds. \n2. **LEFT (2, 9)**: Drifts me closer to the nearest apples without immediate danger from Snake #2, keeping a safe trajectory.\n3. **RIGHT (4, 9)**: Back to a previous cell, not advancing toward apples and places me closer to where Snake #2 was recently.\n4. **DOWN (3, 8)**: Moves toward Snake #2's current and potential paths, increasing the risk of engagement.\n\n**Safety Analysis**:\n- **LEFT (2, 9)** is the best move to stay away from Snake #2 while progressing toward the apples at (2, 3) and (2, 2).\n- This move maintains a safer distance as Snake #2 continues its position on the lower rows.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn**:\n- Analyze Snake #2\u2019s moves carefully; this will be crucial to avoid entrapment.\n- Reassess the board position to continue efficiently targeting apples while ensuring safety from both the enemy snake and walls.\n\n**Decided Move**: LEFT"

Safe but not very productive in terms of collecting apples.\n3. **RIGHT (3, 9)**: Moves away from Snake #2 but doesn't progress toward the apples.
