It keeps you heading towards potential points while avoiding the danger posed by the enemy\u2019s proximity.\n\n### Strategic Note for Next Turn:\nAfter moving down to (8, 6), I'll focus on identifying which apples I can reach without colliding into the enemy's territory.

It keeps you heading towards potential points while avoiding the danger posed by the enemy\u2019s proximity.\n\n### Strategic Note for Next Turn:\nAfter moving down to (8, 6), I'll focus on identifying which apples I can reach without colliding into the enemy's territory.
