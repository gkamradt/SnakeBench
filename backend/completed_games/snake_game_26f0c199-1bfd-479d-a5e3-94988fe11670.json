The snake behind you (ID #2) is 8 steps away horizontally, so it does not pose an immediate threat.\n\nConsidering these possibilities, I would prefer to go for the apple at (1, 6) because it maximizes my growth potential.\n\n### Chosen Move:\nMove UP to (0, 5). \n\nNext move after that would be evaluated based on where I am afterward. \n\nDecided next move: UP."
