Moving DOWN was a good decision, as it positioned me perfectly to collect the apple at (6, 6).\n2. I should move LEFT to collect the apple and grow my snake.\n3. The enemy snake is still far away, so I can safely collect the apple without immediate risk of collision.\n4. After collecting the apple, I should assess the situation and determine the best path to the next closest apple, which appears to be at (5, 7).\n\nStrategy for next turns:\n1. Move LEFT to collect the apple at (6, 6) and grow my snake.\n2. After collecting the apple, move UP to position myself closer to the apple at (5, 7).\n3. Keep monitoring the enemy snake's movements and be prepared to change course if necessary.\n4. Plan a safe path to reach the apple at (5, 7) while maintaining a safe distance from the walls and the enemy snake.\n\nReminder for next turn:\n* After collecting the apple at (6, 6), prioritize reaching the apple at (5, 7) safely.\n* Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements and adapt my strategy if it starts approaching me or the apples.\n* Always plan ahead to ensure a clear path to the next apple and maintain room for maneuverability.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

Keep monitoring the enemy snake's movements, but prioritize collecting the apple at (4, 1) as long as it remains safe.\n4. Always think ahead to ensure a clear and safe path to the next apple, considering the growing size of my snake and the limitations of the game board.\n\nReminder for next turn:\n* Move LEFT as planned to reach position (6, 2), which is closer to the apple at (4, 1).\n* After reaching (6, 2), start planning a path upwards to collect the apple at (4, 1), considering potential obstacles.\n* Stay aware of the enemy snake's movements and the game board's boundaries to avoid collisions.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

Apple (2, 7) is still to my left and appears accessible\n4. Enemy snake is below on the same x-coordinate (4)\n\nOptions:\n- UP: Blocked by T obstacles\n- DOWN: Available but enemy snake is below on same column\n- LEFT: Continues path toward apple (2, 7)\n- RIGHT: Blocked by T obstacles\n\nStrategy considerations:\n1. Continuing LEFT aligns with previous strategy\n2. Apple (2, 7) is two moves away now\n3. Need to avoid moving down as it could lead to conflict with enemy snake\n4. T obstacles continue to limit movement options\n\nDecision:\nI'll move LEFT because:\n1. Continues direct path to apple (2, 7)\n2. Maintains safe distance from enemy snake\n3. Avoids T obstacles\n4. Most logical continuation of previous strategy\n\nNext turn strategy to remember:\n- Will be one move away from apple (2, 7)\n- Plan next moves to lower apples after securing (2, 7)\n- Keep monitoring enemy snake's position\n- Consider downward path after getting apple if safe\n\nLEFT"
