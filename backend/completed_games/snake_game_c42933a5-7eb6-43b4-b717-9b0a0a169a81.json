It's a bit of a risky path due to Snake #2's proximity, but is the closest.\n2. **(1, 7)** is another potential target which is somewhat safer to reach avoiding immediate constriction but requires more steps.\n\n### Threat and Safety Assessment\n- **Enemy Snake #2:** It's at position (3, 1), with a body stretching to (3, 3). This means they're quite close to the apples at (4, 3) and (3, 0), which my strategy labels as risky targets currently.\n- **Walls and Obstacles:** Moving towards the bottom of the board near the apple at (4, 0) risks engagement with the enemy if they plan to pursue apples there, especially given their proximity to the lower row.\n\n### Path Decision\n- A safe and calculated approach would be to head towards the apple at (1, 7). This trajectory keeps me away from the immediate vicinity of the opponent's snake body while keeping an open lane for maneuver.\n- Given I'm at (6, 5), a potential path could be to initially move **RIGHT** towards the open path initially, clearing Snake #2's existing position with forward planning.\n\n### Decision\n- **Move Chosen:** RIGHT\n- Positioning to (7, 5) sets a trajectory towards the upper section of the board, safely moving towards (1, 7).\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nPost-move evaluation should focus on monitoring Snake #2's changes as they could potentially redirect based on their closer proximity to the lower apples.

It's a bit of a risky path due to Snake #2's proximity, but is the closest.\n2. **(1, 7)** is another potential target which is somewhat safer to reach avoiding immediate constriction but requires more steps.\n\n### Threat and Safety Assessment\n- **Enemy Snake #2:** It's at position (3, 1), with a body stretching to (3, 3). This means they're quite close to the apples at (4, 3) and (3, 0), which my strategy labels as risky targets currently.\n- **Walls and Obstacles:** Moving towards the bottom of the board near the apple at (4, 0) risks engagement with the enemy if they plan to pursue apples there, especially given their proximity to the lower row.\n\n### Path Decision\n- A safe and calculated approach would be to head towards the apple at (1, 7). This trajectory keeps me away from the immediate vicinity of the opponent's snake body while keeping an open lane for maneuver.\n- Given I'm at (6, 5), a potential path could be to initially move **RIGHT** towards the open path initially, clearing Snake #2's existing position with forward planning.\n\n### Decision\n- **Move Chosen:** RIGHT\n- Positioning to (7, 5) sets a trajectory towards the upper section of the board, safely moving towards (1, 7).\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nPost-move evaluation should focus on monitoring Snake #2's changes as they could potentially redirect based on their closer proximity to the lower apples.

It's a bit of a risky path due to Snake #2's proximity, but is the closest.\n2. **(1, 7)** is another potential target which is somewhat safer to reach avoiding immediate constriction but requires more steps.\n\n### Threat and Safety Assessment\n- **Enemy Snake #2:** It's at position (3, 1), with a body stretching to (3, 3).

While the apples around the lower-left region remain risky due to the proximity to the enemy snake, (1, 7) and (9, 6) are less risky.\n  \n### Path Analysis Towards Apples\n\n1. **(1, 7):** This apple is still on the left side of the board. I will need to move left after reaching a suitable y-coordinate. Being cautious of corners and remaining aware of the enemy snake's movements, especially as I traverse possible lines of its trajectory, is crucial.\n  \n2. **(9, 6):** There is an apple directly to my right. Although not part of the original strategy, this apple is immediately accessible. Capturing it can boost my points quickly and then perhaps allow tackling other apples afterward.\n  \n3. **(...Apples on Column 4):** These are near the enemy and still involve more risk to obtain, so I should avoid these until the situation changes.\n  \n### Calculated Move\n\nGiven my current position at (7, 6), it might initially seem optimal to continue towards (1, 7); however, with an apple directly at (9, 6), there is an opportunity to grow quickly without leaving much of my current goal behind. I should try to collect this apple, boost my points, and then reassess the path towards (1, 7).\n\nI need to keep tabs on enemy movements or potential head-to-head collisions should I continue towards the left. \n\n### Strategy Update for Next Turn\n\n- **Immediate Goal:** Move right to collect the apple at (9, 6). This action captures an apple efficiently while avoiding current threats.\n- **Next Plan:** Re-evaluate the board after moving to (9, 6). Continue monitoring the enemy snake's position and decide the safest and highest-yielding apple to pursue next.\n\n**Decided Move:** RIGHT"
