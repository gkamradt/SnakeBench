This is directly beneficial and the safest move.\n   - Moving UP, DOWN, or LEFT doesn\u2019t provide any immediate benefit. Additionally, going UP or LEFT would move me away from the nearest apple.\n\n4. **Future Strategy Considerations:**\n   - After eating the apple at (6, 6), I will need to reassess the remaining apple positions and my placement relative to the enemy snake. Next targets might be apples at (9, 2) or (7, 1) depending on the enemy\u2019s movement and other developing circumstances.\n\n5. **Final Decision:**\n   - Moving RIGHT to (6, 6) not only secures an apple and a point but also keeps my snake in a relatively safe position away from walls and the enemy.

The apple at (7, 1) is closer in a horizontal direction while the apple at (9, 2) is further away and towards the top-right corner.\n\n**Enemy Snake Position:**\n- Enemy Snake #2 is at (8, 6), two positions to the right of my current location and has no body segments. Therefore, the immediate threat is minimal unless the enemy chooses to cross my path or block an apple.\n\n**Assessing Possible Moves:**\n- **UP**: Moving up does not provide any immediate benefit, as it moves me away from closest apples.\n- **DOWN**: Moving down could eventually position me towards the apple at (7, 1), but care should be taken as moving directly downwards for multiple turns away from the center could be limiting in terms of escape routes and board coverage.\n- **LEFT**: Moving left doesn't provide immediate benefits and isn't strategically necessary.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right puts me at (7, 6), closer to the apple at (7, 1), even though the apple is much lower down. It's a step towards covering more of the board horizontally and can position me better against the enemy snake.\n\n**Future Strategy Considerations:**\n- Post the next move, it will be crucial to consider vertical movements based on the enemy's position and trajectory towards the apple at (7, 1). The risk of the enemy snake heading downward could influence my next set of movements. Strategy to potentially cut it off or reach the apple first might be necessary.\n\n**Final Decision:**\nGiven that moving towards more apples while maintaining positional advantage over the enemy snake is crucial, moving RIGHT seems most strategic. It contributes to horizontal expansion and avoids the snake tail-chasing scenario.

With no body segments listed, it seems to have no effect on the immediate decision-making since it's distant and not near any crucial paths or apple locations.\n\n3. **Assessing Possible Moves:**\n   - Moving RIGHT to (6, 6) lets me eat the apple and grow. This is directly beneficial and the safest move.\n   - Moving UP, DOWN, or LEFT doesn\u2019t provide any immediate benefit. Additionally, going UP or LEFT would move me away from the nearest apple.\n\n4. **Future Strategy Considerations:**\n   - After eating the apple at (6, 6), I will need to reassess the remaining apple positions and my placement relative to the enemy snake. Next targets might be apples at (9, 2) or (7, 1) depending on the enemy\u2019s movement and other developing circumstances.\n\n5. **Final Decision:**\n   - Moving RIGHT to (6, 6) not only secures an apple and a point but also keeps my snake in a relatively safe position away from walls and the enemy. This direction also maximizes my growth potential and points.\n\n--Decided Next Move: RIGHT--"
