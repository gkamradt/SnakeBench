The closest apple is at (3, 5), which I could reach by moving left (4, 5) and further down.\n2. Moving **UP** again keeps my options open, and I can decide on my next move based on the resulting position.\n3.

Also, it won't lead to any advantageous positioning.\n   \n3. **LEFT to (4, 6)**: \n   - Moving left keeps options open but does not approach the immediate apples. We would be free of any threats here, but it does not help our goal.\n   \n4. **RIGHT to (6, 6)**: \n   - This does not move towards any apples either and ends further away from our immediate goal.\n\n### Strategy Consideration:\n- The primary proximity goal is to reach the apple at (3, 5). This requires moving left, down, and then left again.\n- Another important aspect is to avoid backward moves unless absolutely necessary.\n \nNow considering all of this, the best option that keeps our options alive while working towards reaching one of the apples is to move **left** to (4, 6). While it may not directly bring us to an apple this turn, it will open up possibilities for the next.\n\nSo my next move will be: **LEFT**."
