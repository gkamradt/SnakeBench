            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (1,8). The apples are located at (6,4), (1,4), (9,2), (3,4), and (4,1). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (3,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . A . . A . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWhere:\n\n- 2 is my snake's head at (1,8)\n\n- 1 is the enemy snake's head at (3,5)\n\n- A represents apples at the specified positions\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider my current position: (1,8). What are my immediate options?\n\n- Up: (1,9) \u2014 but the grid only goes up to Y=9, so that's the top row. Is (1,9) occupied? Looking at the board, row 9 is all dots, so it's empty.\n\n- Down: (1,7)\n\n- Left: (0,8)\n\n- Right: (2,8)\n\nFirst, I should check if any of these positions are occupied by apples or the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (1,9): empty\n\n- (1,7): empty\n\n- (0,8): empty\n\n- (2,8): empty\n\nSo none of my immediate moves lead directly to an apple. I need to think about which direction might lead me closer to an apple without putting me in danger.\n\nLet's look at the apples:\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,1)\n\nI'm at (1,8). The closest apple seems to be (1,4), which is directly down in the same column.\n\nLet me calculate the distance to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- To (6,4): |1-6| + |8-4| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\n- To (1,4): |1-1| + |8-4| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\n- To (9,2): |1-9| + |8-2| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\n- To (3,4): |1-3| + |8-4| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- To (4,1): |1-4| + |8-1| = 3 + 7 = 10\n\nSo, (1,4) is the closest apple at a distance of 4.\n\nMaybe I should head towards (1,4). That means moving down to row 4, column 1.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's see if the enemy is in my way.\n\nEnemy is at (3,5), which is at column 3, row 5.\n\nI'm at (1,8), and I want to go to (1,4). So, I need to move down from row 8 to row 4.\n\nLet's see what's between me and the apple:\n\n- (1,7)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\nLooking at the board, these positions seem empty.\n\nBut I need to consider if the enemy might move into my path.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,5). If it moves left to (2,5), then to (1,5), it could potentially block my path to (1,5), but since I'm moving down to (1,5), and the enemy is at (3,5), it would need to move left twice to reach (1,5). But snakes can't occupy the same space, so as long as I reach (1,5) before the enemy can get there, I should be fine.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider going for a different apple that's less crowded.\n\nLet's look at the other apples:\n\n- (6,4): that's further away, at a distance of 9.\n\n- (9,2): even further, 14.\n\n- (3,4): distance 6.\n\n- (4,1): distance 10.\n\nSo, (1,4) is still the closest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for (3,4), which is also relatively close, and perhaps avoid the enemy.\n\nLet's think about the path to (3,4):\n\nFrom (1,8) to (3,4):\n\nOption 1: move right to (2,8), then down to (2,7), etc.\n\nBut that seems longer.\n\nOption 2: move down to (1,7), then right to (2,7), then down to (2,6), etc.\n\nThis is getting messy.\n\nMaybe I should consider the path in terms of directions.\n\nLet's think in terms of first moving right to column 3, then down to row 4.\n\nSo, from (1,8):\n\n- Right to (2,8)\n\n- Right to (3,8)\n\n- Down to (3,7)\n\n- Down to (3,6)\n\n- Down to (3,5) \u2014 but the enemy is at (3,5), so that could be problematic.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,8):\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Right to (2,7)\n\n- Right to (3,7)\n\n- Down to (3,6)\n\n- Down to (3,5) \u2014 again, enemy at (3,5).\n\nThis seems risky.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (4,1), even though it's farther.\n\nFrom (1,8):\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Right to (2,7)\n\n- Right to (3,7)\n\n- Right to (4,7)\n\n- Down to (4,6)\n\n- Down to (4,5)\n\n- Down to (4,4)\n\n- Down to (4,3)\n\n- Down to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (4,1)\n\nThat's a long path, and I might encounter the enemy along the way.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should just go for the closest apple, (1,4), and hope for the best.\n\nSo, from (1,8), I need to move down to (1,7), then to (1,6), then to (1,5), and finally to (1,4).\n\nLet's see: is there any risk in this path?\n\n- (1,7): empty\n\n- (1,6): empty\n\n- (1,5): empty\n\n- (1,4): apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,5). If it moves left to (2,5), then to (1,5), it could block my path to (1,5).\n\nBut if I move fast enough, I can reach (1,5) before the enemy does.\n\nAlternatively, if I eat the apple at (1,4), I grow longer, which might give me an advantage.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the enemy's behavior.\n\nMaybe I should just take the risk and go for (1,4).\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move down to (1,7).\n\nWait, no: from (1,8), moving down would be to (1,7).\n\nBut looking back at the board, row 7 is all dots, so empty.\n\nYes, that's fine.\n\nSo, my move this turn should be down to (1,7).\n\nBut wait, in the board representation, row 8 has '. 2 . . . . . . . .', which is X=0 to X=9.\n\nSo, (1,8) is X=1, Y=8.\n\nMoving down to (1,7), which should be X=1, Y=7.\n\nLooking at the board, row 7 is all dots, so empty.\n\nOkay, that's safe.\n\nSo, I'll choose to move down.\n\nBut before I make that decision, let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move down to (1,7), and the enemy moves towards me, I might get cornered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider moving left or right to avoid the enemy.\n\nBut moving left to (0,"

That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (0,8). Hmm, looking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . A . . A . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, I'm at (0,8), which is the second cell from the left on row 8.\n\nThere are apples at (6,4), (1,4), (9,2), (3,4), and (4,1). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (3,6), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nMy last move was to the left, and my rationale was to head towards the closest apple at (1,4). But I need to think carefully because the enemy is moving too.\n\nFirst, let's assess my current position and possible moves.\n\nFrom (0,8), I can move:\n\n- Up to (0,9)\n\n- Down to (0,7)\n\n- Left is not possible because X can't be negative.\n\n- Right to (1,8)\n\nSo, my options are up, down, or right.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. **Up to (0,9):**\n\n- Looking at row 9, it's all dots, so empty.\n\n- But I need to think about where this leads me.\n\n- Moving up would take me towards the top of the board, but there are no apples in that direction immediately.\n\n- I need to see if there's a path to any apple from there.\n\n2. **Down to (0,7):**\n\n- Row 7 is empty.\n\n- Continuing down, row 6 is empty, row 5 has the enemy at (3,5).\n\n- So, moving down might bring me closer to the apple at (1,4), but I have to be careful not to run into the enemy.\n\n3. **Right to (1,8):**\n\n- Looking at (1,8), it's empty.\n\n- Moving right would put me at (1,8), and from there, I can consider moving down towards (1,4).\n\n- This seems like a possible path to the closest apple.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (1,8) might be a good starting point to head towards (1,4).\n\nBut wait, in my last move, I moved left, but now I'm considering moving right. Maybe I need to adjust my strategy.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- I'm at (0,8).\n\n- The apple at (1,4) is one unit to the right and four units down.\n\n- The enemy is at (3,6).\n\nIf I move right to (1,8), then I can start moving down towards (1,4).\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy isn't going to block my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going down first to (0,7), then right to (1,7), and so on towards (1,4).\n\nLet me map out a path:\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Right to (1,8)\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4) \u2014 apple\n\nThat's a direct path to the apple at (1,4).\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Down to (0,7)\n\n- Right to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4) \u2014 apple\n\nBoth options lead to the apple, but Option 1 is slightly shorter because it's only four moves down compared to Option 2, which is also four moves down but starts with a right move.\n\nWait, no:\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Right to (1,8)\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\nThat's four down moves after moving right once.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Down to (0,7)\n\n- Right to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\nThat's also four down moves plus one right move, but in a different order.\n\nSo, in terms of move count, they are similar.\n\nHowever, considering the enemy's position at (3,6), I need to see if it might interfere.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,6), and if it moves towards me, it could potentially block my path.\n\nBut if I move right to (1,8), and then down, the enemy would have to move to (1,6) to block me, but that's a few moves away.\n\nMoreover, snakes can't occupy the same space, so as long as I reach (1,4) before the enemy can get there, I should be fine.\n\nBut this is getting a bit too speculative.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for a different apple that's not directly in line with the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apple at (9,2), that's far away, and likely not worth the trouble right now.\n\nThe apple at (3,4) is at (3,4), which is a bit closer than (9,2), but still farther than (1,4).\n\nThe apple at (4,1) is at (4,1), which is also relatively far.\n\nSo, (1,4) is still the closest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (6,4), which is at (6,4).\n\nLet me calculate the distance to (6,4):\n\nFrom (0,8):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |0-6| = 6\n\n- Vertical distance: |8-4| = 4\n\n- Total: 10 moves.\n\nWait, no:\n\nManhattan distance: 6 + 4 = 10 moves.\n\nWait, no, Manhattan distance is |delta X| + |delta Y|, so 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nBut earlier, for (1,4), it was 1 right and 4 down, total 5 moves.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 4 moves, but actually, from (0,8) to (1,4):\n\n- Right to (1,8)\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\nThat's 1 right and 4 down, total 5 moves.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I thought it was 4 moves, but actually, it's 5 moves.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,4):\n\n- Right to (6,8)\n\n- Down to (6,7)\n\n- Down to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\nThat's 6 rights and 4 downs, but actually, from (0,8) to (6,4):\n\n- Right 6 times\n\n- Down 4 times\n\nThat's a total of 10 moves.\n\nSo, (1,4) is much closer at 5 moves.\n\nSo, sticking with the plan to go to (1,4).\n\nTherefore, for this turn, I should move right to (1,8).\n\nBut wait, in my last move, I moved left, which would have been to (0,8) from somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps there's some confusion here.\n\nLooking back at the last move information, it says:\n\n\"Direction: LEFT\n\nRationale: Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (0,8). ... \"\n\nSo, I just moved to (0,8) by moving left.\n\nWait, but in the board, (0,8) is the leftmost cell in row 8.\n\nIf I move left from there, I would go out of bounds and die, so I can't move left again.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to correct my understanding.\n\nWait, in the last move, I moved left to (0,8). Now, from (0,8), I can't move left again because X can't be negative.\n\nSo, my options are up, down, or right.\n\nTherefore, I need to decide between up, down, or right.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (1,8) seems like a good idea to start heading towards the apple at (1,4).\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move right to (1,8).\n\nBut before finalizing, let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move right to (1,8), and the enemy moves"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (1,8). The apples are located at (6,4), (1,4), (9,2), (3,4), and (4,1). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (3,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . A . . A . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWhere:\n\n- 2 is my snake's head at (1,8)\n\n- 1 is the enemy snake's head at (3,5)\n\n- A represents apples at the specified positions\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider my current position: (1,8). What are my immediate options?\n\n- Up: (1,9) \u2014 but the grid only goes up to Y=9, so that's the top row. Is (1,9) occupied? Looking at the board, row 9 is all dots, so it's empty.\n\n- Down: (1,7)\n\n- Left: (0,8)\n\n- Right: (2,8)\n\nFirst, I should check if any of these positions are occupied by apples or the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (1,9): empty\n\n- (1,7): empty\n\n- (0,8): empty\n\n- (2,8): empty\n\nSo none of my immediate moves lead directly to an apple. I need to think about which direction might lead me closer to an apple without putting me in danger.\n\nLet's look at the apples:\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,1)\n\nI'm at (1,8). The closest apple seems to be (1,4), which is directly down in the same column.\n\nLet me calculate the distance to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- To (6,4): |1-6| + |8-4| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\n- To (1,4): |1-1| + |8-4| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\n- To (9,2): |1-9| + |8-2| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\n- To (3,4): |1-3| + |8-4| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- To (4,1): |1-4| + |8-1| = 3 + 7 = 10\n\nSo, (1,4) is the closest apple at a distance of 4.\n\nMaybe I should head towards (1,4). That means moving down to row 4, column 1.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's see if the enemy is in my way.\n\nEnemy is at (3,5), which is at column 3, row 5.\n\nI'm at (1,8), and I want to go to (1,4). So, I need to move down from row 8 to row 4.\n\nLet's see what's between me and the apple:\n\n- (1,7)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\nLooking at the board, these positions seem empty.\n\nBut I need to consider if the enemy might move into my path.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,5). If it moves left to (2,5), then to (1,5), it could potentially block my path to (1,5), but since I'm moving down to (1,5), and the enemy is at (3,5), it would need to move left twice to reach (1,5). But snakes can't occupy the same space, so as long as I reach (1,5) before the enemy can get there, I should be fine.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider going for a different apple that's less crowded.\n\nLet's look at the other apples:\n\n- (6,4): that's further away, at a distance of 9.\n\n- (9,2): even further, 14.\n\n- (3,4): distance 6.\n\n- (4,1): distance 10.\n\nSo, (1,4) is still the closest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for (3,4), which is also relatively close, and perhaps avoid the enemy.\n\nLet's think about the path to (3,4):\n\nFrom (1,8) to (3,4):\n\nOption 1: move right to (2,8), then down to (2,7), etc.\n\nBut that seems longer.\n\nOption 2: move down to (1,7), then right to (2,7), then down to (2,6), etc.\n\nThis is getting messy.\n\nMaybe I should consider the path in terms of directions.\n\nLet's think in terms of first moving right to column 3, then down to row 4.\n\nSo, from (1,8):\n\n- Right to (2,8)\n\n- Right to (3,8)\n\n- Down to (3,7)\n\n- Down to (3,6)\n\n- Down to (3,5) \u2014 but the enemy is at (3,5), so that could be problematic.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,8):\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Right to (2,7)\n\n- Right to (3,7)\n\n- Down to (3,6)\n\n- Down to (3,5) \u2014 again, enemy at (3,5).\n\nThis seems risky.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (4,1), even though it's farther.\n\nFrom (1,8):\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Right to (2,7)\n\n- Right to (3,7)\n\n- Right to (4,7)\n\n- Down to (4,6)\n\n- Down to (4,5)\n\n- Down to (4,4)\n\n- Down to (4,3)\n\n- Down to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (4,1)\n\nThat's a long path, and I might encounter the enemy along the way.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should just go for the closest apple, (1,4), and hope for the best.\n\nSo, from (1,8), I need to move down to (1,7), then to (1,6), then to (1,5), and finally to (1,4).\n\nLet's see: is there any risk in this path?\n\n- (1,7): empty\n\n- (1,6): empty\n\n- (1,5): empty\n\n- (1,4): apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,5). If it moves left to (2,5), then to (1,5), it could block my path to (1,5).\n\nBut if I move fast enough, I can reach (1,5) before the enemy does.\n\nAlternatively, if I eat the apple at (1,4), I grow longer, which might give me an advantage.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the enemy's behavior.\n\nMaybe I should just take the risk and go for (1,4).\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move down to (1,7).\n\nWait, no: from (1,8), moving down would be to (1,7).\n\nBut looking back at the board, row 7 is all dots, so empty.\n\nYes, that's fine.\n\nSo, my move this turn should be down to (1,7).\n\nBut wait, in the board representation, row 8 has '. 2 . . . . . . . .', which is X=0 to X=9.\n\nSo, (1,8) is X=1, Y=8.\n\nMoving down to (1,7), which should be X=1, Y=7.\n\nLooking at the board, row 7 is all dots, so empty.\n\nOkay, that's safe.\n\nSo, I'll choose to move down.\n\nBut before I make that decision, let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move down to (1,7), and the enemy moves towards me, I might get cornered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider moving left or right to avoid the enemy.\n\nBut moving left to (0,"

Maybe I need to adjust my strategy.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- I'm at (0,8).\n\n- The apple at (1,4) is one unit to the right and four units down.\n\n- The enemy is at (3,6).\n\nIf I move right to (1,8), then I can start moving down towards (1,4).\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy isn't going to block my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going down first to (0,7), then right to (1,7), and so on towards (1,4).\n\nLet me map out a path:\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Right to (1,8)\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4) \u2014 apple\n\nThat's a direct path to the apple at (1,4).\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Down to (0,7)\n\n- Right to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4) \u2014 apple\n\nBoth options lead to the apple, but Option 1 is slightly shorter because it's only four moves down compared to Option 2, which is also four moves down but starts with a right move.\n\nWait, no:\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Right to (1,8)\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\nThat's four down moves after moving right once.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Down to (0,7)\n\n- Right to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\nThat's also four down moves plus one right move, but in a different order.\n\nSo, in terms of move count, they are similar.\n\nHowever, considering the enemy's position at (3,6), I need to see if it might interfere.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,6), and if it moves towards me, it could potentially block my path.\n\nBut if I move right to (1,8), and then down, the enemy would have to move to (1,6) to block me, but that's a few moves away.\n\nMoreover, snakes can't occupy the same space, so as long as I reach (1,4) before the enemy can get there, I should be fine.\n\nBut this is getting a bit too speculative.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for a different apple that's not directly in line with the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apple at (9,2), that's far away, and likely not worth the trouble right now.\n\nThe apple at (3,4) is at (3,4), which is a bit closer than (9,2), but still farther than (1,4).\n\nThe apple at (4,1) is at (4,1), which is also relatively far.\n\nSo, (1,4) is still the closest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (6,4), which is at (6,4).\n\nLet me calculate the distance to (6,4):\n\nFrom (0,8):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |0-6| = 6\n\n- Vertical distance: |8-4| = 4\n\n- Total: 10 moves.\n\nWait, no:\n\nManhattan distance: 6 + 4 = 10 moves.\n\nWait, no, Manhattan distance is |delta X| + |delta Y|, so 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nBut earlier, for (1,4), it was 1 right and 4 down, total 5 moves.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 4 moves, but actually, from (0,8) to (1,4):\n\n- Right to (1,8)\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\nThat's 1 right and 4 down, total 5 moves.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I thought it was 4 moves, but actually, it's 5 moves.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,4):\n\n- Right to (6,8)\n\n- Down to (6,7)\n\n- Down to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\nThat's 6 rights and 4 downs, but actually, from (0,8) to (6,4):\n\n- Right 6 times\n\n- Down 4 times\n\nThat's a total of 10 moves.\n\nSo, (1,4) is much closer at 5 moves.\n\nSo, sticking with the plan to go to (1,4).\n\nTherefore, for this turn, I should move right to (1,8).\n\nBut wait, in my last move, I moved left, which would have been to (0,8) from somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps there's some confusion here.\n\nLooking back at the last move information, it says:\n\n\"Direction: LEFT\n\nRationale: Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (0,8). ... \"\n\nSo, I just moved to (0,8) by moving left.\n\nWait, but in the board, (0,8) is the leftmost cell in row 8.\n\nIf I move left from there, I would go out of bounds and die, so I can't move left again.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to correct my understanding.\n\nWait, in the last move, I moved left to (0,8). Now, from (0,8), I can't move left again because X can't be negative.\n\nSo, my options are up, down, or right.\n\nTherefore, I need to decide between up, down, or right.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (1,8) seems like a good idea to start heading towards the apple at (1,4).\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move right to (1,8).\n\nBut before finalizing, let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move right to (1,8), and the enemy moves"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (1,8). Wait, in the last information, it said (0,8), but in the board, it shows (1,8). Let me check the board again.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: .

A . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, indeed, I'm at (1,8), which is the second cell from the left on row 8.\n\nThere are apples at (6,4), (1,4), (9,2), (3,4), and (4,1). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (3,7), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nWait, in the last information, it said the enemy is at (3,6), but on the board, it's shown at (3,7). Let me make sure.\n\nLooking back, the last move information says the enemy is at (3,7), so maybe there was a confusion earlier.\n\nAlright, so enemy snake 1 is at (3,7), which is on row 7, column 3.\n\nMy current position is (1,8), which is on row 8, column 1.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible moves from my current position:\n\n- Up: (1,9) \u2014 but the board only goes up to (9,9), so that's valid.\n\n- Down: (1,7)\n\n- Left: (0,8)\n\n- Right: (2,8)\n\nWait, in the last move, I moved left to (0,8), but looking at the board, it shows me at (1,8). Maybe there's some confusion here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the board. Let's look again.\n\nRow 8: . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, indeed, I'm at (1,8). Maybe in the last move, I was at (2,8) and moved left to (1,8). That makes sense.\n\nSo, from (1,8), my possible moves are:\n\n- Up: (1,9) \u2014 unoccupied, seems safe.\n\n- Down: (1,7) \u2014 unoccupied.\n\n- Left: (0,8) \u2014 edge of the board, can't go beyond, so moving left would mean staying in place or dying. Wait, in most snake games, moving off the board kills you, so left is not an option.\n\n- Right: (2,8) \u2014 unoccupied.\n\nSo, my options are up, down, or right.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to go based on getting to the nearest apple while avoiding the enemy.\n\nLet's look at the apples:\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,1)\n\nI need to calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (1,8) to each apple:\n\n1. To (6,4):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-6| = 5\n\n   - Delta Y: |8-4| = 4\n\n   - Total: 5 + 4 = 9\n\n2. To (1,4):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-1| = 0\n\n   - Delta Y: |8-4| = 4\n\n   - Total: 0 + 4 = 4\n\n3. To (9,2):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-9| = 8\n\n   - Delta Y: |8-2| = 6\n\n   - Total: 8 + 6 = 14\n\n4. To (3,4):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-3| = 2\n\n   - Delta Y: |8-4| = 4\n\n   - Total: 2 + 4 = 6\n\n5. To (4,1):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-4| = 3\n\n   - Delta Y: |8-1| = 7\n\n   - Total: 3 + 7 = 10\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,4), with a distance of 4.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense to head towards (1,4).\n\nNow, to get from (1,8) to (1,4), I need to move down 4 times.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's position and movements.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,7). If it moves up, it goes to (3,8), which isn't in my way. If it moves down, it goes to (3,6), which is also not immediately in my path.\n\nIf I move down to (1,7), then the enemy could potentially move towards me, but it's still a couple of steps away.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or get blocked.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (2,8), but that doesn't bring me closer to the apple at (1,4). In fact, it takes me further away.\n\nWait, moving right from (1,8) to (2,8) would increase my X coordinate, moving me away from the apple at (1,4).\n\nSo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, the best option is to move down to (1,7), heading towards (1,4).\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move down to (1,7), and the enemy moves down to (3,6), it's still not in my way.\n\nThen, I can continue down to (1,6), and so on, until I reach (1,4).\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (1,9), that takes me further away from the apple, which isn't ideal.\n\nSo, moving down seems to be the way to go.\n\nAnother consideration is that if I move down to (1,7), I need to ensure that there are no obstacles or other snakes in my path.\n\nLooking at the board, row 7 is empty, so it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, rows 6 and 5 are empty, except for the enemy at (3,5), which is not in my path.\n\nTherefore, moving down to (1,7) is a safe move towards the apple at (1,4).\n\nI should proceed with moving down.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left to (1,8). If I now move down to (1,7), I'm changing direction from left to down.\n\nI need to make sure that my snake can handle this change in direction.\n\nIn most snake games, snakes have a body that follows the head, so as long as I don't make a 180-degree turn, it should be fine.\n\nIn this case, moving from left to down is a 90-degree turn, which should be acceptable.\n\nTherefore, moving down is safe.\n\nAlright, I think I've made up my mind.\n\nI'll move down to (1,7) this turn, heading towards the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**"

The apples are located at (6,4), (1,4), (9,2), (3,4), and (4,1). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (3,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: .

A . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWhere:\n\n- 2 is my snake's head at (1,8)\n\n- 1 is the enemy snake's head at (3,5)\n\n- A represents apples at the specified positions\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider my current position: (1,8). What are my immediate options?\n\n- Up: (1,9) \u2014 but the grid only goes up to Y=9, so that's the top row. Is (1,9) occupied? Looking at the board, row 9 is all dots, so it's empty.\n\n- Down: (1,7)\n\n- Left: (0,8)\n\n- Right: (2,8)\n\nFirst, I should check if any of these positions are occupied by apples or the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (1,9): empty\n\n- (1,7): empty\n\n- (0,8): empty\n\n- (2,8): empty\n\nSo none of my immediate moves lead directly to an apple. I need to think about which direction might lead me closer to an apple without putting me in danger.\n\nLet's look at the apples:\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,1)\n\nI'm at (1,8). The closest apple seems to be (1,4), which is directly down in the same column.\n\nLet me calculate the distance to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- To (6,4): |1-6| + |8-4| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\n- To (1,4): |1-1| + |8-4| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\n- To (9,2): |1-9| + |8-2| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\n- To (3,4): |1-3| + |8-4| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- To (4,1): |1-4| + |8-1| = 3 + 7 = 10\n\nSo, (1,4) is the closest apple at a distance of 4.\n\nMaybe I should head towards (1,4). That means moving down to row 4, column 1.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's see if the enemy is in my way.\n\nEnemy is at (3,5), which is at column 3, row 5.\n\nI'm at (1,8), and I want to go to (1,4). So, I need to move down from row 8 to row 4.\n\nLet's see what's between me and the apple:\n\n- (1,7)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\nLooking at the board, these positions seem empty.\n\nBut I need to consider if the enemy might move into my path.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,5). If it moves left to (2,5), then to (1,5), it could potentially block my path to (1,5), but since I'm moving down to (1,5), and the enemy is at (3,5), it would need to move left twice to reach (1,5). But snakes can't occupy the same space, so as long as I reach (1,5) before the enemy can get there, I should be fine.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider going for a different apple that's less crowded.\n\nLet's look at the other apples:\n\n- (6,4): that's further away, at a distance of 9.\n\n- (9,2): even further, 14.\n\n- (3,4): distance 6.\n\n- (4,1): distance 10.\n\nSo, (1,4) is still the closest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for (3,4), which is also relatively close, and perhaps avoid the enemy.\n\nLet's think about the path to (3,4):\n\nFrom (1,8) to (3,4):\n\nOption 1: move right to (2,8), then down to (2,7), etc.\n\nBut that seems longer.\n\nOption 2: move down to (1,7), then right to (2,7), then down to (2,6), etc.\n\nThis is getting messy.\n\nMaybe I should consider the path in terms of directions.\n\nLet's think in terms of first moving right to column 3, then down to row 4.\n\nSo, from (1,8):\n\n- Right to (2,8)\n\n- Right to (3,8)\n\n- Down to (3,7)\n\n- Down to (3,6)\n\n- Down to (3,5) \u2014 but the enemy is at (3,5), so that could be problematic.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,8):\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Right to (2,7)\n\n- Right to (3,7)\n\n- Down to (3,6)\n\n- Down to (3,5) \u2014 again, enemy at (3,5).\n\nThis seems risky.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (4,1), even though it's farther.\n\nFrom (1,8):\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Right to (2,7)\n\n- Right to (3,7)\n\n- Right to (4,7)\n\n- Down to (4,6)\n\n- Down to (4,5)\n\n- Down to (4,4)\n\n- Down to (4,3)\n\n- Down to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (4,1)\n\nThat's a long path, and I might encounter the enemy along the way.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should just go for the closest apple, (1,4), and hope for the best.\n\nSo, from (1,8), I need to move down to (1,7), then to (1,6), then to (1,5), and finally to (1,4).\n\nLet's see: is there any risk in this path?\n\n- (1,7): empty\n\n- (1,6): empty\n\n- (1,5): empty\n\n- (1,4): apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,5). If it moves left to (2,5), then to (1,5), it could block my path to (1,5).\n\nBut if I move fast enough, I can reach (1,5) before the enemy does.\n\nAlternatively, if I eat the apple at (1,4), I grow longer, which might give me an advantage.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the enemy's behavior.\n\nMaybe I should just take the risk and go for (1,4).\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move down to (1,7).\n\nWait, no: from (1,8), moving down would be to (1,7).\n\nBut looking back at the board, row 7 is all dots, so empty.\n\nYes, that's fine.\n\nSo, my move this turn should be down to (1,7).\n\nBut wait, in the board representation, row 8 has '. 2 . . . . . . . .', which is X=0 to X=9.\n\nSo, (1,8) is X=1, Y=8.\n\nMoving down to (1,7), which should be X=1, Y=7.\n\nLooking at the board, row 7 is all dots, so empty.\n\nOkay, that's safe.\n\nSo, I'll choose to move down.\n\nBut before I make that decision, let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move down to (1,7), and the enemy moves towards me, I might get cornered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider moving left or right to avoid the enemy.\n\nBut moving left to (0,"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (0,8). Hmm, looking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . A . .

A . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, I'm at (0,8), which is the second cell from the left on row 8.\n\nThere are apples at (6,4), (1,4), (9,2), (3,4), and (4,1). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (3,6), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nMy last move was to the left, and my rationale was to head towards the closest apple at (1,4). But I need to think carefully because the enemy is moving too.\n\nFirst, let's assess my current position and possible moves.\n\nFrom (0,8), I can move:\n\n- Up to (0,9)\n\n- Down to (0,7)\n\n- Left is not possible because X can't be negative.\n\n- Right to (1,8)\n\nSo, my options are up, down, or right.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. **Up to (0,9):**\n\n- Looking at row 9, it's all dots, so empty.\n\n- But I need to think about where this leads me.\n\n- Moving up would take me towards the top of the board, but there are no apples in that direction immediately.\n\n- I need to see if there's a path to any apple from there.\n\n2. **Down to (0,7):**\n\n- Row 7 is empty.\n\n- Continuing down, row 6 is empty, row 5 has the enemy at (3,5).\n\n- So, moving down might bring me closer to the apple at (1,4), but I have to be careful not to run into the enemy.\n\n3. **Right to (1,8):**\n\n- Looking at (1,8), it's empty.\n\n- Moving right would put me at (1,8), and from there, I can consider moving down towards (1,4).\n\n- This seems like a possible path to the closest apple.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (1,8) might be a good starting point to head towards (1,4).\n\nBut wait, in my last move, I moved left, but now I'm considering moving right. Maybe I need to adjust my strategy.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- I'm at (0,8).\n\n- The apple at (1,4) is one unit to the right and four units down.\n\n- The enemy is at (3,6).\n\nIf I move right to (1,8), then I can start moving down towards (1,4).\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy isn't going to block my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going down first to (0,7), then right to (1,7), and so on towards (1,4).\n\nLet me map out a path:\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Right to (1,8)\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4) \u2014 apple\n\nThat's a direct path to the apple at (1,4).\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Down to (0,7)\n\n- Right to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4) \u2014 apple\n\nBoth options lead to the apple, but Option 1 is slightly shorter because it's only four moves down compared to Option 2, which is also four moves down but starts with a right move.\n\nWait, no:\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Right to (1,8)\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\nThat's four down moves after moving right once.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Down to (0,7)\n\n- Right to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\nThat's also four down moves plus one right move, but in a different order.\n\nSo, in terms of move count, they are similar.\n\nHowever, considering the enemy's position at (3,6), I need to see if it might interfere.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,6), and if it moves towards me, it could potentially block my path.\n\nBut if I move right to (1,8), and then down, the enemy would have to move to (1,6) to block me, but that's a few moves away.\n\nMoreover, snakes can't occupy the same space, so as long as I reach (1,4) before the enemy can get there, I should be fine.\n\nBut this is getting a bit too speculative.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for a different apple that's not directly in line with the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apple at (9,2), that's far away, and likely not worth the trouble right now.\n\nThe apple at (3,4) is at (3,4), which is a bit closer than (9,2), but still farther than (1,4).\n\nThe apple at (4,1) is at (4,1), which is also relatively far.\n\nSo, (1,4) is still the closest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (6,4), which is at (6,4).\n\nLet me calculate the distance to (6,4):\n\nFrom (0,8):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |0-6| = 6\n\n- Vertical distance: |8-4| = 4\n\n- Total: 10 moves.\n\nWait, no:\n\nManhattan distance: 6 + 4 = 10 moves.\n\nWait, no, Manhattan distance is |delta X| + |delta Y|, so 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nBut earlier, for (1,4), it was 1 right and 4 down, total 5 moves.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 4 moves, but actually, from (0,8) to (1,4):\n\n- Right to (1,8)\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\nThat's 1 right and 4 down, total 5 moves.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I thought it was 4 moves, but actually, it's 5 moves.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,4):\n\n- Right to (6,8)\n\n- Down to (6,7)\n\n- Down to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\nThat's 6 rights and 4 downs, but actually, from (0,8) to (6,4):\n\n- Right 6 times\n\n- Down 4 times\n\nThat's a total of 10 moves.\n\nSo, (1,4) is much closer at 5 moves.\n\nSo, sticking with the plan to go to (1,4).\n\nTherefore, for this turn, I should move right to (1,8).\n\nBut wait, in my last move, I moved left, which would have been to (0,8) from somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps there's some confusion here.\n\nLooking back at the last move information, it says:\n\n\"Direction: LEFT\n\nRationale: Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (0,8). ... \"\n\nSo, I just moved to (0,8) by moving left.\n\nWait, but in the board, (0,8) is the leftmost cell in row 8.\n\nIf I move left from there, I would go out of bounds and die, so I can't move left again.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to correct my understanding.\n\nWait, in the last move, I moved left to (0,8). Now, from (0,8), I can't move left again because X can't be negative.\n\nSo, my options are up, down, or right.\n\nTherefore, I need to decide between up, down, or right.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (1,8) seems like a good idea to start heading towards the apple at (1,4).\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move right to (1,8).\n\nBut before finalizing, let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move right to (1,8), and the enemy moves"

That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (1,8). Wait, in the last information, it said (0,8), but in the board, it shows (1,8).

There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (3,7), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nWait, in the last information, it said the enemy is at (3,6), but on the board, it's shown at (3,7). Let me make sure.\n\nLooking back, the last move information says the enemy is at (3,7), so maybe there was a confusion earlier.\n\nAlright, so enemy snake 1 is at (3,7), which is on row 7, column 3.\n\nMy current position is (1,8), which is on row 8, column 1.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible moves from my current position:\n\n- Up: (1,9) \u2014 but the board only goes up to (9,9), so that's valid.\n\n- Down: (1,7)\n\n- Left: (0,8)\n\n- Right: (2,8)\n\nWait, in the last move, I moved left to (0,8), but looking at the board, it shows me at (1,8). Maybe there's some confusion here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the board. Let's look again.\n\nRow 8: . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, indeed, I'm at (1,8). Maybe in the last move, I was at (2,8) and moved left to (1,8). That makes sense.\n\nSo, from (1,8), my possible moves are:\n\n- Up: (1,9) \u2014 unoccupied, seems safe.\n\n- Down: (1,7) \u2014 unoccupied.\n\n- Left: (0,8) \u2014 edge of the board, can't go beyond, so moving left would mean staying in place or dying. Wait, in most snake games, moving off the board kills you, so left is not an option.\n\n- Right: (2,8) \u2014 unoccupied.\n\nSo, my options are up, down, or right.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to go based on getting to the nearest apple while avoiding the enemy.\n\nLet's look at the apples:\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,1)\n\nI need to calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (1,8) to each apple:\n\n1. To (6,4):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-6| = 5\n\n   - Delta Y: |8-4| = 4\n\n   - Total: 5 + 4 = 9\n\n2. To (1,4):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-1| = 0\n\n   - Delta Y: |8-4| = 4\n\n   - Total: 0 + 4 = 4\n\n3. To (9,2):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-9| = 8\n\n   - Delta Y: |8-2| = 6\n\n   - Total: 8 + 6 = 14\n\n4. To (3,4):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-3| = 2\n\n   - Delta Y: |8-4| = 4\n\n   - Total: 2 + 4 = 6\n\n5. To (4,1):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-4| = 3\n\n   - Delta Y: |8-1| = 7\n\n   - Total: 3 + 7 = 10\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,4), with a distance of 4.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense to head towards (1,4).\n\nNow, to get from (1,8) to (1,4), I need to move down 4 times.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's position and movements.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,7). If it moves up, it goes to (3,8), which isn't in my way. If it moves down, it goes to (3,6), which is also not immediately in my path.\n\nIf I move down to (1,7), then the enemy could potentially move towards me, but it's still a couple of steps away.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or get blocked.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (2,8), but that doesn't bring me closer to the apple at (1,4). In fact, it takes me further away.\n\nWait, moving right from (1,8) to (2,8) would increase my X coordinate, moving me away from the apple at (1,4).\n\nSo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, the best option is to move down to (1,7), heading towards (1,4).\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move down to (1,7), and the enemy moves down to (3,6), it's still not in my way.\n\nThen, I can continue down to (1,6), and so on, until I reach (1,4).\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (1,9), that takes me further away from the apple, which isn't ideal.\n\nSo, moving down seems to be the way to go.\n\nAnother consideration is that if I move down to (1,7), I need to ensure that there are no obstacles or other snakes in my path.\n\nLooking at the board, row 7 is empty, so it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, rows 6 and 5 are empty, except for the enemy at (3,5), which is not in my path.\n\nTherefore, moving down to (1,7) is a safe move towards the apple at (1,4).\n\nI should proceed with moving down.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left to (1,8). If I now move down to (1,7), I'm changing direction from left to down.\n\nI need to make sure that my snake can handle this change in direction.\n\nIn most snake games, snakes have a body that follows the head, so as long as I don't make a 180-degree turn, it should be fine.\n\nIn this case, moving from left to down is a 90-degree turn, which should be acceptable.\n\nTherefore, moving down is safe.\n\nAlright, I think I've made up my mind.\n\nI'll move down to (1,7) this turn, heading towards the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**"

Okay, that's consistent.\n\nAlright, so enemy snake 1 is at (3,5), which is on row 5, column 3.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible moves from my current position:\n\n- Up: (1,8) \u2014 seems valid, as it's within the board.\n\n- Down: (1,6)\n\n- Left: (0,7) \u2014 edge of the board, but in most snake games, you can go off the edge.\n\nWait, in this game, if I go off the board, do I die or does the snake wrap around? The rules say if you run into a wall, you die, so probably no wrapping. So, moving left to (0,7) is fine, but moving left again to (-1,7) would kill me.\n\n- Right: (2,7) \u2014 also valid.\n\nSo, my options are up, down, left, or right.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to go based on getting to the nearest apple while avoiding the enemy.\n\nLet's look at the apples:\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,1)\n\nI need to calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (1,7) to each apple:\n\n1. To (6,4):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-6| = 5\n\n   - Delta Y: |7-4| = 3\n\n   - Total: 5 + 3 = 8\n\n2. To (1,4):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-1| = 0\n\n   - Delta Y: |7-4| = 3\n\n   - Total: 0 + 3 = 3\n\n3. To (9,2):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-9| = 8\n\n   - Delta Y: |7-2| = 5\n\n   - Total: 8 + 5 = 13\n\n4. To (3,4):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-3| = 2\n\n   - Delta Y: |7-4| = 3\n\n   - Total: 2 + 3 = 5\n\n5. To (4,1):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-4| = 3\n\n   - Delta Y: |7-1| = 6\n\n   - Total: 3 + 6 = 9\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,4), with a distance of 3.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense to head towards (1,4).\n\nNow, to get from (1,7) to (1,4), I need to move down 3 times.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's position and movements.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,5). If it moves up, it goes to (3,6), which isn't in my way. If it moves down, it goes to (3,4), which is the same row as the apple I'm targeting.\n\nIf I move down to (1,6), and the enemy moves down to (3,4), it's not directly in my path, but I need to be cautious.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or get blocked.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left to (0,7), but that doesn't bring me closer to the apple at (1,4). In fact, it moves me away.\n\nSimilarly, moving right to (2,7) also moves me away from the apple.\n\nSo, the best option seems to be moving down to (1,6).\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move down to (1,6), the enemy is at (3,5). If it moves down to (3,4), I need to make sure that I can reach (1,4) before the enemy can potentially block my path.\n\nBut since I'm only 2 steps away from (1,4), and the enemy is 1 step away from (3,4), I should be fine, as I can reach the apple before the enemy can reach (3,4).\n\nAdditionally, there are other apples, but the one at (1,4) is the closest, so prioritizing it makes sense.\n\nAnother consideration is that after eating the apple at (1,4), I'll grow, so I need to make sure that my path is clear for my extended body.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting to (1,4) seems like the best plan.\n\nTherefore, I'll proceed with moving down to (1,6).\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**"

The apples are located at (6,4), (1,4), (9,2), (3,4), and (4,1). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (3,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . A . . A . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nWhere:\n\n- 2 is my snake's head at (1,8)\n\n- 1 is the enemy snake's head at (3,5)\n\n- A represents apples at the specified positions\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet's consider my current position: (1,8). What are my immediate options?\n\n- Up: (1,9) \u2014 but the grid only goes up to Y=9, so that's the top row. Is (1,9) occupied? Looking at the board, row 9 is all dots, so it's empty.\n\n- Down: (1,7)\n\n- Left: (0,8)\n\n- Right: (2,8)\n\nFirst, I should check if any of these positions are occupied by apples or the enemy.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- (1,9): empty\n\n- (1,7): empty\n\n- (0,8): empty\n\n- (2,8): empty\n\nSo none of my immediate moves lead directly to an apple. I need to think about which direction might lead me closer to an apple without putting me in danger.\n\nLet's look at the apples:\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,1)\n\nI'm at (1,8). The closest apple seems to be (1,4), which is directly down in the same column.\n\nLet me calculate the distance to each apple using Manhattan distance (since the snake moves grid by grid):\n\n- To (6,4): |1-6| + |8-4| = 5 + 4 = 9\n\n- To (1,4): |1-1| + |8-4| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\n- To (9,2): |1-9| + |8-2| = 8 + 6 = 14\n\n- To (3,4): |1-3| + |8-4| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- To (4,1): |1-4| + |8-1| = 3 + 7 = 10\n\nSo, (1,4) is the closest apple at a distance of 4.\n\nMaybe I should head towards (1,4). That means moving down to row 4, column 1.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that path is clear and that I won't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nFirst, let's see if the enemy is in my way.\n\nEnemy is at (3,5), which is at column 3, row 5.\n\nI'm at (1,8), and I want to go to (1,4). So, I need to move down from row 8 to row 4.\n\nLet's see what's between me and the apple:\n\n- (1,7)\n\n- (1,6)\n\n- (1,5)\n\n- (1,4)\n\nLooking at the board, these positions seem empty.\n\nBut I need to consider if the enemy might move into my path.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,5). If it moves left to (2,5), then to (1,5), it could potentially block my path to (1,5), but since I'm moving down to (1,5), and the enemy is at (3,5), it would need to move left twice to reach (1,5). But snakes can't occupy the same space, so as long as I reach (1,5) before the enemy can get there, I should be fine.\n\nBut this is getting complicated. Maybe I should consider going for a different apple that's less crowded.\n\nLet's look at the other apples:\n\n- (6,4): that's further away, at a distance of 9.\n\n- (9,2): even further, 14.\n\n- (3,4): distance 6.\n\n- (4,1): distance 10.\n\nSo, (1,4) is still the closest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can go for (3,4), which is also relatively close, and perhaps avoid the enemy.\n\nLet's think about the path to (3,4):\n\nFrom (1,8) to (3,4):\n\nOption 1: move right to (2,8), then down to (2,7), etc.\n\nBut that seems longer.\n\nOption 2: move down to (1,7), then right to (2,7), then down to (2,6), etc.\n\nThis is getting messy.\n\nMaybe I should consider the path in terms of directions.\n\nLet's think in terms of first moving right to column 3, then down to row 4.\n\nSo, from (1,8):\n\n- Right to (2,8)\n\n- Right to (3,8)\n\n- Down to (3,7)\n\n- Down to (3,6)\n\n- Down to (3,5) \u2014 but the enemy is at (3,5), so that could be problematic.\n\nAlternatively, from (1,8):\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Right to (2,7)\n\n- Right to (3,7)\n\n- Down to (3,6)\n\n- Down to (3,5) \u2014 again, enemy at (3,5).\n\nThis seems risky.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (4,1), even though it's farther.\n\nFrom (1,8):\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Right to (2,7)\n\n- Right to (3,7)\n\n- Right to (4,7)\n\n- Down to (4,6)\n\n- Down to (4,5)\n\n- Down to (4,4)\n\n- Down to (4,3)\n\n- Down to (4,2)\n\n- Down to (4,1)\n\nThat's a long path, and I might encounter the enemy along the way.\n\nThis is getting too complicated. Maybe I should just go for the closest apple, (1,4), and hope for the best.\n\nSo, from (1,8), I need to move down to (1,7), then to (1,6), then to (1,5), and finally to (1,4).\n\nLet's see: is there any risk in this path?\n\n- (1,7): empty\n\n- (1,6): empty\n\n- (1,5): empty\n\n- (1,4): apple\n\nSeems clear.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,5). If it moves left to (2,5), then to (1,5), it could block my path to (1,5).\n\nBut if I move fast enough, I can reach (1,5) before the enemy does.\n\nAlternatively, if I eat the apple at (1,4), I grow longer, which might give me an advantage.\n\nBut I'm not sure about the enemy's behavior.\n\nMaybe I should just take the risk and go for (1,4).\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move down to (1,7).\n\nWait, no: from (1,8), moving down would be to (1,7).\n\nBut looking back at the board, row 7 is all dots, so empty.\n\nYes, that's fine.\n\nSo, my move this turn should be down to (1,7).\n\nBut wait, in the board representation, row 8 has '. 2 . . . . . . . .', which is X=0 to X=9.\n\nSo, (1,8) is X=1, Y=8.\n\nMoving down to (1,7), which should be X=1, Y=7.\n\nLooking at the board, row 7 is all dots, so empty.\n\nOkay, that's safe.\n\nSo, I'll choose to move down.\n\nBut before I make that decision, let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move down to (1,7), and the enemy moves towards me, I might get cornered.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider moving left or right to avoid the enemy.\n\nBut moving left to (0,"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (0,8).

There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (3,6), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nMy last move was to the left, and my rationale was to head towards the closest apple at (1,4). But I need to think carefully because the enemy is moving too.\n\nFirst, let's assess my current position and possible moves.\n\nFrom (0,8), I can move:\n\n- Up to (0,9)\n\n- Down to (0,7)\n\n- Left is not possible because X can't be negative.\n\n- Right to (1,8)\n\nSo, my options are up, down, or right.\n\nLet's consider each option:\n\n1. **Up to (0,9):**\n\n- Looking at row 9, it's all dots, so empty.\n\n- But I need to think about where this leads me.\n\n- Moving up would take me towards the top of the board, but there are no apples in that direction immediately.\n\n- I need to see if there's a path to any apple from there.\n\n2. **Down to (0,7):**\n\n- Row 7 is empty.\n\n- Continuing down, row 6 is empty, row 5 has the enemy at (3,5).\n\n- So, moving down might bring me closer to the apple at (1,4), but I have to be careful not to run into the enemy.\n\n3. **Right to (1,8):**\n\n- Looking at (1,8), it's empty.\n\n- Moving right would put me at (1,8), and from there, I can consider moving down towards (1,4).\n\n- This seems like a possible path to the closest apple.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (1,8) might be a good starting point to head towards (1,4).\n\nBut wait, in my last move, I moved left, but now I'm considering moving right. Maybe I need to adjust my strategy.\n\nLet me think about the positions:\n\n- I'm at (0,8).\n\n- The apple at (1,4) is one unit to the right and four units down.\n\n- The enemy is at (3,6).\n\nIf I move right to (1,8), then I can start moving down towards (1,4).\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy isn't going to block my path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going down first to (0,7), then right to (1,7), and so on towards (1,4).\n\nLet me map out a path:\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Right to (1,8)\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4) \u2014 apple\n\nThat's a direct path to the apple at (1,4).\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Down to (0,7)\n\n- Right to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4) \u2014 apple\n\nBoth options lead to the apple, but Option 1 is slightly shorter because it's only four moves down compared to Option 2, which is also four moves down but starts with a right move.\n\nWait, no:\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Right to (1,8)\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\nThat's four down moves after moving right once.\n\nOption 2:\n\n- Down to (0,7)\n\n- Right to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\nThat's also four down moves plus one right move, but in a different order.\n\nSo, in terms of move count, they are similar.\n\nHowever, considering the enemy's position at (3,6), I need to see if it might interfere.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,6), and if it moves towards me, it could potentially block my path.\n\nBut if I move right to (1,8), and then down, the enemy would have to move to (1,6) to block me, but that's a few moves away.\n\nMoreover, snakes can't occupy the same space, so as long as I reach (1,4) before the enemy can get there, I should be fine.\n\nBut this is getting a bit too speculative.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for a different apple that's not directly in line with the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apple at (9,2), that's far away, and likely not worth the trouble right now.\n\nThe apple at (3,4) is at (3,4), which is a bit closer than (9,2), but still farther than (1,4).\n\nThe apple at (4,1) is at (4,1), which is also relatively far.\n\nSo, (1,4) is still the closest.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the apple at (6,4), which is at (6,4).\n\nLet me calculate the distance to (6,4):\n\nFrom (0,8):\n\n- Horizontal distance: |0-6| = 6\n\n- Vertical distance: |8-4| = 4\n\n- Total: 10 moves.\n\nWait, no:\n\nManhattan distance: 6 + 4 = 10 moves.\n\nWait, no, Manhattan distance is |delta X| + |delta Y|, so 6 + 4 = 10.\n\nBut earlier, for (1,4), it was 1 right and 4 down, total 5 moves.\n\nWait, earlier I thought it was 4 moves, but actually, from (0,8) to (1,4):\n\n- Right to (1,8)\n\n- Down to (1,7)\n\n- Down to (1,6)\n\n- Down to (1,5)\n\n- Down to (1,4)\n\nThat's 1 right and 4 down, total 5 moves.\n\nWait, but in my earlier calculation, I thought it was 4 moves, but actually, it's 5 moves.\n\nSimilarly, to (6,4):\n\n- Right to (6,8)\n\n- Down to (6,7)\n\n- Down to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\nThat's 6 rights and 4 downs, but actually, from (0,8) to (6,4):\n\n- Right 6 times\n\n- Down 4 times\n\nThat's a total of 10 moves.\n\nSo, (1,4) is much closer at 5 moves.\n\nSo, sticking with the plan to go to (1,4).\n\nTherefore, for this turn, I should move right to (1,8).\n\nBut wait, in my last move, I moved left, which would have been to (0,8) from somewhere else.\n\nWait, perhaps there's some confusion here.\n\nLooking back at the last move information, it says:\n\n\"Direction: LEFT\n\nRationale: Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (0,8). ... \"\n\nSo, I just moved to (0,8) by moving left.\n\nWait, but in the board, (0,8) is the leftmost cell in row 8.\n\nIf I move left from there, I would go out of bounds and die, so I can't move left again.\n\nSo, perhaps I need to correct my understanding.\n\nWait, in the last move, I moved left to (0,8). Now, from (0,8), I can't move left again because X can't be negative.\n\nSo, my options are up, down, or right.\n\nTherefore, I need to decide between up, down, or right.\n\nGiven that, moving right to (1,8) seems like a good idea to start heading towards the apple at (1,4).\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move right to (1,8).\n\nBut before finalizing, let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move right to (1,8), and the enemy moves"

Let me make sure.\n\nLooking back, the last move information says the enemy is at (3,7), so maybe there was a confusion earlier.\n\nAlright, so enemy snake 1 is at (3,7), which is on row 7, column 3.\n\nMy current position is (1,8), which is on row 8, column 1.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible moves from my current position:\n\n- Up: (1,9) \u2014 but the board only goes up to (9,9), so that's valid.\n\n- Down: (1,7)\n\n- Left: (0,8)\n\n- Right: (2,8)\n\nWait, in the last move, I moved left to (0,8), but looking at the board, it shows me at (1,8). Maybe there's some confusion here.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the board. Let's look again.\n\nRow 8: . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, indeed, I'm at (1,8). Maybe in the last move, I was at (2,8) and moved left to (1,8). That makes sense.\n\nSo, from (1,8), my possible moves are:\n\n- Up: (1,9) \u2014 unoccupied, seems safe.\n\n- Down: (1,7) \u2014 unoccupied.\n\n- Left: (0,8) \u2014 edge of the board, can't go beyond, so moving left would mean staying in place or dying. Wait, in most snake games, moving off the board kills you, so left is not an option.\n\n- Right: (2,8) \u2014 unoccupied.\n\nSo, my options are up, down, or right.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to go based on getting to the nearest apple while avoiding the enemy.\n\nLet's look at the apples:\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,1)\n\nI need to calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (1,8) to each apple:\n\n1. To (6,4):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-6| = 5\n\n   - Delta Y: |8-4| = 4\n\n   - Total: 5 + 4 = 9\n\n2. To (1,4):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-1| = 0\n\n   - Delta Y: |8-4| = 4\n\n   - Total: 0 + 4 = 4\n\n3. To (9,2):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-9| = 8\n\n   - Delta Y: |8-2| = 6\n\n   - Total: 8 + 6 = 14\n\n4. To (3,4):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-3| = 2\n\n   - Delta Y: |8-4| = 4\n\n   - Total: 2 + 4 = 6\n\n5. To (4,1):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-4| = 3\n\n   - Delta Y: |8-1| = 7\n\n   - Total: 3 + 7 = 10\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,4), with a distance of 4.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense to head towards (1,4).\n\nNow, to get from (1,8) to (1,4), I need to move down 4 times.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's position and movements.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,7). If it moves up, it goes to (3,8), which isn't in my way. If it moves down, it goes to (3,6), which is also not immediately in my path.\n\nIf I move down to (1,7), then the enemy could potentially move towards me, but it's still a couple of steps away.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or get blocked.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving right to (2,8), but that doesn't bring me closer to the apple at (1,4). In fact, it takes me further away.\n\nWait, moving right from (1,8) to (2,8) would increase my X coordinate, moving me away from the apple at (1,4).\n\nSo, that doesn't make sense.\n\nTherefore, the best option is to move down to (1,7), heading towards (1,4).\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move down to (1,7), and the enemy moves down to (3,6), it's still not in my way.\n\nThen, I can continue down to (1,6), and so on, until I reach (1,4).\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (1,9), that takes me further away from the apple, which isn't ideal.\n\nSo, moving down seems to be the way to go.\n\nAnother consideration is that if I move down to (1,7), I need to ensure that there are no obstacles or other snakes in my path.\n\nLooking at the board, row 7 is empty, so it should be safe.\n\nSimilarly, rows 6 and 5 are empty, except for the enemy at (3,5), which is not in my path.\n\nTherefore, moving down to (1,7) is a safe move towards the apple at (1,4).\n\nI should proceed with moving down.\n\nWait, but in the last move, I moved left to (1,8). If I now move down to (1,7), I'm changing direction from left to down.\n\nI need to make sure that my snake can handle this change in direction.\n\nIn most snake games, snakes have a body that follows the head, so as long as I don't make a 180-degree turn, it should be fine.\n\nIn this case, moving from left to down is a 90-degree turn, which should be acceptable.\n\nTherefore, moving down is safe.\n\nAlright, I think I've made up my mind.\n\nI'll move down to (1,7) this turn, heading towards the apple at (1,4).\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**"

Let's see what I've got here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nMy snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (1,7). Wait, in the last information, it said (1,7), but looking at the board, it seems like I'm at (1,7). Let me confirm.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . 2 . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . 1 . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . A . A . . A . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 1: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, I'm at (1,7), which is the second cell from the left on row 7.\n\nThere are apples at (6,4), (1,4), (9,2), (3,4), and (4,1). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (3,5), with no body parts listed, so it's probably just the head.\n\nWait, in the last information, the enemy was at (3,5), but on the board, it's shown at (3,5). Okay, that's consistent.\n\nAlright, so enemy snake 1 is at (3,5), which is on row 5, column 3.\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, let's consider the possible moves from my current position:\n\n- Up: (1,8) \u2014 seems valid, as it's within the board.\n\n- Down: (1,6)\n\n- Left: (0,7) \u2014 edge of the board, but in most snake games, you can go off the edge.\n\nWait, in this game, if I go off the board, do I die or does the snake wrap around? The rules say if you run into a wall, you die, so probably no wrapping. So, moving left to (0,7) is fine, but moving left again to (-1,7) would kill me.\n\n- Right: (2,7) \u2014 also valid.\n\nSo, my options are up, down, left, or right.\n\nNow, I need to decide which direction to go based on getting to the nearest apple while avoiding the enemy.\n\nLet's look at the apples:\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (1,4)\n\n- (9,2)\n\n- (3,4)\n\n- (4,1)\n\nI need to calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (1,7) to each apple:\n\n1. To (6,4):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-6| = 5\n\n   - Delta Y: |7-4| = 3\n\n   - Total: 5 + 3 = 8\n\n2. To (1,4):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-1| = 0\n\n   - Delta Y: |7-4| = 3\n\n   - Total: 0 + 3 = 3\n\n3. To (9,2):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-9| = 8\n\n   - Delta Y: |7-2| = 5\n\n   - Total: 8 + 5 = 13\n\n4. To (3,4):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-3| = 2\n\n   - Delta Y: |7-4| = 3\n\n   - Total: 2 + 3 = 5\n\n5. To (4,1):\n\n   - Delta X: |1-4| = 3\n\n   - Delta Y: |7-1| = 6\n\n   - Total: 3 + 6 = 9\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,4), with a distance of 3.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense to head towards (1,4).\n\nNow, to get from (1,7) to (1,4), I need to move down 3 times.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's position and movements.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,5). If it moves up, it goes to (3,6), which isn't in my way. If it moves down, it goes to (3,4), which is the same row as the apple I'm targeting.\n\nIf I move down to (1,6), and the enemy moves down to (3,4), it's not directly in my path, but I need to be cautious.\n\nMoreover, I need to make sure that I don't run into the enemy or get blocked.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving left to (0,7), but that doesn't bring me closer to the apple at (1,4). In fact, it moves me away.\n\nSimilarly, moving right to (2,7) also moves me away from the apple.\n\nSo, the best option seems to be moving down to (1,6).\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move down to (1,6), the enemy is at (3,5). If it moves down to (3,4), I need to make sure that I can reach (1,4) before the enemy can potentially block my path.\n\nBut since I'm only 2 steps away from (1,4), and the enemy is 1 step away from (3,4), I should be fine, as I can reach the apple before the enemy can reach (3,4).\n\nAdditionally, there are other apples, but the one at (1,4) is the closest, so prioritizing it makes sense.\n\nAnother consideration is that after eating the apple at (1,4), I'll grow, so I need to make sure that my path is clear for my extended body.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting to (1,4) seems like the best plan.\n\nTherefore, I'll proceed with moving down to (1,6).\n\n**Final Decision: DOWN**"

The goal is to maximize points by eating apples while avoiding collisions.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify Current Position and Apples:**\n   - Determine the snake's current position.\n   - List the positions of all apples on the board.\n\n2. **Calculate Distances:**\n   - Use Manhattan distance to calculate the distance from the snake's head to each apple.\n   - Identify the closest apple.\n\n3. **Evaluate Possible Moves:**\n   - Determine possible moves (up, down, left, right).\n   - Assess each move for safety and progress towards the closest apple.\n\n4. **Consider Enemy Snake:**\n   - Check the position of the enemy snake and predict its possible moves.\n   - Ensure the chosen move does not lead to a collision with the enemy.\n\n5. **Make a Decision:**\n   - Select the move that minimizes distance to the closest apple while avoiding danger.\n\n### Solution Code\n\n```python\n# Define the current position of the snake\ncurrent_position = (1, 6)\n\n# Define the positions of the apples\napples = [(6, 4), (1, 4), (9, 2), (3, 4), (4, 1)]\n\n# Define the position of the enemy snake\nenemy_position = (3, 5)\n\n# Function to calculate Manhattan distance\ndef manhattan_distance(pos1, pos2):\n    return abs(pos1[0] - pos2[0]) + abs(pos1[1] - pos2[1])\n\n# Find the closest apple\nclosest_apple = min(apples, key=lambda apple: manhattan_distance(current_position, apple))\n\n# Calculate the direction towards the closest apple\napple_x, apple_y = closest_apple\ncurrent_x, current_y = current_position\n\nif apple_x < current_x:\n    direction = \"LEFT\"\nelif apple_x > current_x:\n    direction = \"RIGHT\"\nelif apple_y < current_y:\n    direction = \"DOWN\"\nelse:\n    direction = \"UP\"\n\n# Check for potential collision with enemy\n# Predict enemy's possible moves\nenemy_possible_moves = [\n    (enemy_position[0], enemy_position[1] + 1),  # up\n    (enemy_position[0], enemy_position[1] - 1),  # down\n    (enemy_position[0] - 1, enemy_position[1]),  # left\n    (enemy_position[0] + 1, enemy_position[1])   # right\n]\n\n# Check if the chosen move leads to a position where the enemy might be\nnext_position = current_position\nif direction == \"UP\":\n    next_position = (current_x, current_y + 1)\nelif direction == \"DOWN\":\n    next_position = (current_x, current_y - 1)\nelif direction == \"LEFT\":\n    next_position = (current_x - 1, current_y)\nelif direction == \"RIGHT\":\n    next"
