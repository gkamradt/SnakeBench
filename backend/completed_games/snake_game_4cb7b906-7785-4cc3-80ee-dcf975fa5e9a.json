Moving LEFT or RIGHT would be safe options. However, moving DOWN for the time being as closest position slower step wise will instantly gain apple scenario.\n\nAlso, note: from head (2,9) to (5,6) - (5,5)- 4 vertical down( (3,4)- vertical down reaches apple #4 same for apple #2 sloping clearance path safety consideration.\n\n**Next Move**:\nDon't go unreasonable by risking self immediately to avoid losing crazy upu down upto the apple trails.\n\n**Direction**: DOWN"
