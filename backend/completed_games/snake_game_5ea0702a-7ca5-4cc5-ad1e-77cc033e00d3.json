Following that, I\u2019ll need to reassess my position and the positions of any enemies before determining my next action, ensuring that I'm always planning a few turns ahead.

However, as before, there is still the risk of the enemy snake getting to the apple at (4, 3) before my snake can reach it.\n\nBut, the enemy snake seems to be far enough away that it would take a few turns before it can get to that position. As such, it seems safer to try and go for these 3 apples, and ultimately a net gain of 2 points, rather than going for the nearby one and then having to travel a longer distance to get to the others.\n\nNext move: LEFT\n(*There seems to a mistake in the task description. If my starting position is (8, 3) and I aim to get to the apples at (2, 2), (2, 3) and (4, 3), the direction should be LEFT, not RIGHT.
