The closest apple is at (3, 5), which is to the right and then slightly down from our current position. However, we must be cautious not to move into the path of the enemy snake (ID: 1), which is currently at (1, 5) with its body at (2, 5).\n\nTo safely navigate towards the apple at (3, 5), we should first move left to (3, 3), which will put us in line with the apple and allow us to monitor the enemy snake's movements. If the enemy snake continues to move up or stays in its current position, we can then move down to (3, 4) and then right to collect the apple at (3, 5).\n\nIt's important to note that we should avoid moving directly towards the enemy snake's body or head-on into its path. Therefore, moving left first is the safest option to avoid potential collisions.\n\nNext move: LEFT.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: After moving left to (3, 3), we should be ready to move down on the subsequent turn to (3, 4), and then move right to collect the apple at (3, 5). We will need to continue monitoring the enemy snake's position and adjust our strategy if it moves towards us or the apples we are targeting. Our ultimate goal is to collect as many apples as possible while avoiding collisions, so flexibility in our movement plan is crucial. If the enemy snake's behavior changes, we may need to target a different apple that is safer to reach."

The closest apple is at (0, 1), and I am currently at (5, 6) after having moved down from (6, 4). My last move was downwards, and I need to continue towards the apple at (0, 1).\n\nSince I am at (5, 6), moving down to (5, 5) would be a mistake because it would take me further away from the apple at (0, 1). Instead, I should move left to (4, 6), which will bring me one step closer to the apple while keeping a safe distance from Snake #1, which is currently at (1, 8) and moving upwards.\n\nAfter moving left to (4, 6), I will be in a position to continue moving left and then up to collect the apple at (0, 1) on my next turn. Once I have collected that apple, I will need to decide whether to go for the apple at (4, 3) or the one at (9, 7). The decision will depend on the positioning of Snake #1 and any potential risks of collision.\n\nFor now, my next move is clear:\n\nNext move: LEFT.\n\nAfter this move, I will be at (4, 6), and I should be ready to move left again and then up to collect the apple at (0, 1) on my next turn. I will need to continue observing Snake #1's behavior to plan my subsequent moves accordingly and avoid any potential collisions."
