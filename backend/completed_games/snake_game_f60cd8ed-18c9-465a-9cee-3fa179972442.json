However, I need to ensure that no other snakes are targeting this cell in the next move.\n   - **Apple Proximity:** No immediate apples above at this position.\n   - **Pros:** Maintains central positioning, keeping options open for various directions in subsequent moves.\n   - **Cons:** Does not lead directly to any nearby apples, potentially delaying point collection.\n\n2. **DOWN to (6, 3):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell (6,3) appears unoccupied on the board and is within the board boundaries. There are no enemy snakes or obstacles in this direction.\n   - **Apple Proximity:** Moving down positions me closer to the apple at (6,2), which can be collected in the subsequent move.\n   - **Pros:** Shortens the path to a nearby apple, enabling quick point gain in the next turn.\n   - **Cons:** Limits immediate access to other areas of the board, but the proximity to an apple outweighs this concern.\n\n3. **LEFT to (5, 4):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell (5,4) is unoccupied and within the board limits. There's no immediate threat from enemy snakes or obstacles.\n   - **Apple Proximity:** While there's no apple directly at (5,4), this move positions me closer to the apple at (5,6), allowing for potential collection in the following moves.\n   - **Pros:** Provides a pathway to the upper-left section of the board, which has available apples.\n   - **Cons:** Requires additional moves to reach the apple, potentially giving other snakes the opportunity to intercept.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 4):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell (7,4) is unoccupied and within the board boundaries. There are no immediate threats in this direction.\n   - **Apple Proximity:** No apples are directly to the right, but moving towards (8,3) could facilitate access to that apple in subsequent moves.\n   - **Pros:** Opens a pathway toward the apple at (8,3).\n   - **Cons:** Moves away from the central area where multiple apples are located, potentially reducing flexibility in future moves.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n- **UP (6, 5):** Safe but does not lead directly to any apples.\n- **DOWN (6, 3):** Safe and brings me closer to the apple at (6, 2), which can be collected in the next move.\n- **LEFT (5, 4):** Safe and positions me towards another apple, though it requires additional moves.\n- **RIGHT (7, 4):** Safe but offers no immediate advantages.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nMoving **DOWN** to **(6, 3)** is the most strategic choice. It safely advances me closer to the apple at (6, 2), enabling quick point acquisition in the following move. Collecting this apple will enhance my position and increase my length, providing better maneuverability for future actions.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nAfter moving **DOWN** to (6, 3), I will prioritize moving **DOWN** again to collect the apple at (6, 2). Once that apple is secured, I'll evaluate the surrounding areas to decide whether to pursue other nearby apples or navigate towards less contested regions of the board. Maintaining awareness of the enemy snake at (2, 4) is crucial to avoid potential collisions. Additionally, I'll aim to keep my movements flexible, allowing for adjustments based on the evolving board state and the positions of other snakes.\n\n**Next Move:** DOWN"

However, I need to ensure that no other snakes are targeting this cell in the next move.\n   - **Apple Proximity:** No immediate apples above at this position.\n   - **Pros:** Maintains central positioning, keeping options open for various directions in subsequent moves.\n   - **Cons:** Does not lead directly to any nearby apples, potentially delaying point collection.\n\n2. **DOWN to (6, 3):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell (6,3) appears unoccupied on the board and is within the board boundaries. There are no enemy snakes or obstacles in this direction.\n   - **Apple Proximity:** Moving down positions me closer to the apple at (6,2), which can be collected in the subsequent move.\n   - **Pros:** Shortens the path to a nearby apple, enabling quick point gain in the next turn.\n   - **Cons:** Limits immediate access to other areas of the board, but the proximity to an apple outweighs this concern.\n\n3. **LEFT to (5, 4):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell (5,4) is unoccupied and within the board limits. There's no immediate threat from enemy snakes or obstacles.\n   - **Apple Proximity:** While there's no apple directly at (5,4), this move positions me closer to the apple at (5,6), allowing for potential collection in the following moves.\n   - **Pros:** Provides a pathway to the upper-left section of the board, which has available apples.\n   - **Cons:** Requires additional moves to reach the apple, potentially giving other snakes the opportunity to intercept.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 4):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell (7,4) is unoccupied and within the board boundaries.

It safely advances me closer to the apple at (6, 2), enabling quick point acquisition in the following move. Collecting this apple will enhance my position and increase my length, providing better maneuverability for future actions.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nAfter moving **DOWN** to (6, 3), I will prioritize moving **DOWN** again to collect the apple at (6, 2). Once that apple is secured, I'll evaluate the surrounding areas to decide whether to pursue other nearby apples or navigate towards less contested regions of the board. Maintaining awareness of the enemy snake at (2, 4) is crucial to avoid potential collisions. Additionally, I'll aim to keep my movements flexible, allowing for adjustments based on the evolving board state and the positions of other snakes.\n\n**Next Move:** DOWN"

Let's evaluate the possible moves:\n\n1. **UP to (8, 4):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell (8, 4) is unoccupied and within board boundaries. No immediate threats from enemy snakes or obstacles.\n   - **Apple Proximity:** There are no apples directly above. Moving up doesn't bring me closer to any immediate apple.\n   - **Pros:** \n     - **Maintains Central Position:** Keeps multiple movement options open for future turns.\n     - **Avoids Immediate Conflicts:** Keeps distance from enemy snakes.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - **No Immediate Point Gain:** Doesn't help in collecting apples.\n     - **Potential to Be Trapped:** Moving upwards might limit access to lower apples if surrounded later.\n\n2. **DOWN to (8, 2):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell (8, 2) is currently occupied by my tail ('T'). Moving into the tail's position is generally safe as the tail moves forward, provided no enemy snake targets this cell in the next move.\n   - **Apple Proximity:** Moving down doesn't position me closer to any apples. In fact, it moves me away from the nearest apple at (4, 2).\n   - **Pros:** \n     - **Safe Move:** No immediate threats.\n   - **Cons:** \n     - **No Advancement Toward Apples:** Does not contribute to score increase.\n     - **Potential Blockage:** Repeatedly moving towards the tail could restrict future movement options.\n\n3. **LEFT to (7, 3):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell (7, 3) is unoccupied and within board boundaries. Currently, no enemy snakes are near this position.\n   - **Apple Proximity:** Moving left brings me closer to the apple at (4, 2), facilitating easier access in subsequent moves.\n   - **Pros:** \n     - **Advances Toward Apples:** Positions me closer to available apples, increasing the likelihood of score gain.\n     - **Maintains Flexibility:** Keeps multiple paths open for maneuvering around the board.\n   - **Cons:** \n     - **Proximity to Own Body:** Approaching areas near my tail requires careful movement to avoid self-collision in future turns.\n     - **Potential Blockage from Enemy Snakes:** Although currently safe, future enemy movements could pose threats in this direction.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 3):**\n   - **Safety:** The cell (9, 3) is unoccupied and within board boundaries. No immediate threats from enemy snakes.\n   - **Apple Proximity:** No apples are located near this position. Moving right takes me further away from all available apples.\n   - **Pros:** \n     - **Explores New Area:** Opens up potential paths along the right edge of the board.\n   - **Cons:** \n     - **No Immediate Benefits:** Does not aid in collecting any apples.\n     - **Limited Future Mobility:** Being near the board's edge might restrict movement options in subsequent turns.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\n- **UP (8, 4):** \n  - **Pros:** Safe and maintains central positioning.\n  - **Cons:** Does not contribute to collecting apples.\n  \n- **DOWN (8, 2):** \n  - **Pros:** Safe move.\n  - **Cons:** Does not aid in score increase and moves away from apples.\n  \n- **LEFT (7, 3):** \n  - **Pros:** Advances toward the apple at (4, 2), increasing potential for score gain.\n  - **Cons:** Requires navigating closer to my own body, which necessitates careful future movements to avoid collisions.\n  \n- **RIGHT (9, 3):** \n  - **Pros:** Safe move.\n  - **Cons:** Does not aid in collecting apples and may limit future mobility.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nMoving **LEFT** to **(7, 3)** is the most strategic choice at this juncture. This move positions me closer to the apple at (4, 2), enhancing the potential for score increment in upcoming turns. While it brings me nearer to my own body, careful navigation in subsequent moves will mitigate collision risks. Additionally, this direction keeps multiple pathways open for flexibility in maneuvering around the board.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n1. **Advance Toward Apples:**\n   - After moving left to (7, 3), continue navigating towards the apple at (4, 2).\n   - Plan a path that avoids close proximity to enemy snakes and minimizes the risk of self-collision.\n\n2. **Maintain Flexibility:**\n   - Keep options open by avoiding movement patterns that could trap the snake.\n   - Monitor enemy snake movements to anticipate and avoid potential blockades or threats.\n\n3. **Prioritize Safety:**\n   - Always ensure that the next move does not lead into walls, enemy snakes, or my own body.\n   - Utilize safe zones and open areas to navigate efficiently.\n\n4. **Monitor Apple Positions:**\n   - Continuously assess the nearest apples to prioritize collection routes.\n   - Adapt strategy based on apple consumption and new apples appearing on the board.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT"
