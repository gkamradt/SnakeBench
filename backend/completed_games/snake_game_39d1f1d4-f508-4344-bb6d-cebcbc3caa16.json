Analyzing the board after the last LEFT move:\n   - My snake is now at (5, 5)\n   - No immediate threat from enemy snake\n   - Multiple apples still available\n\n2. Apple Strategy:\n   - (9, 6) apple looks promising but far\n   - (4, 7) apple is still an attractive target\n   - Want to create a path that gives me options\n\n3. Movement Considerations:\n   - UP looks good to approach (4, 7) apple\n   - Creates diagonal approach path\n   - Keeps movement options open\n   - Doesn't trap myself\n\n4. Safety Check:\n   - No walls to worry about\n   - Enemy snake not blocking direct path\n   - Enough board space to maneuver\n\nNext Turn Strategy:\n- Continue path towards (4, 7) apple\n- Keep track of enemy snake's movements\n- Maintain flexible positioning\n- Avoid getting into tight corners\n\nNext move decision rationale:\n- UP provides best strategic positioning\n- Opens path to nearest apple\n- Maintains good board control\n\nPotential Next Turn Note:\nIf enemy snake moves unexpectedly, be prepared to adjust path quickly.\n\nNext move: UP"

            "rationale": "Let\u2019s evaluate the current situation on the board:\n\n- My snake (ID: 1) is currently at (5, 7).\n- Enemy Snake #2 is at (5, 6) and has a body segment at (5, 5).\n- The apples are located at:\n  - (9, 6)\n  - (2, 0)\n  - (9, 3)\n  - (0, 8)\n  - (9, 5)\n\n### Analyzing Possible Moves from (5, 7):\n\n1. **UP (to (5, 8))**: This is a valid move and does not put me directly in danger or in contact with any apples. However, it gets me closer to the top wall.\n2. **DOWN (to (5, 6))**: This move brings me into immediate contact with the enemy snake (Snake #2) at (5, 6), which is a dangerous choice that would likely lead to death.\n3. **LEFT (to (4, 7))**: This move goes back to my previous position, which is not advantageous.\n4. **RIGHT (to (6, 7))**: This is a valid move that leads away from the enemy snake, and doesn\u2019t come into immediate contact with any apples, but could open potential paths in the future.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\nThe main priority is to avoid confrontation with the enemy snake while also keeping options available for future apple collections. Moving up captures a safe position but leads me towards the edge of the board, which could limit intentional movement in the next turns. Moving down into the enemy snake\u2019s adjacent position is absolute death. Moving left is not a move that helps progress.\n\nThe most promising move seems to be RIGHT to (6, 7). This keeps me at a distance from the enemy snake and positions me away from the potential risk of contact in the next turn.\n\n### Decided next move:\nRIGHT"

Strategic Goals:\n   - Seek closest apple\n   - Maintain maneuverability\n   - Avoid potential snake collision\n\nReasoning for Move:\n- UP keeps me moving towards potential apple targets\n- Provides flexibility in future moves\n- Doesn't immediately threaten collision\n- Maintains good board positioning\n\nStrategy for Next Turn:\n- Continue assessing apple proximity\n- Watch enemy snake's movement\n- Keep escape routes open\n\nNext move: UP"
