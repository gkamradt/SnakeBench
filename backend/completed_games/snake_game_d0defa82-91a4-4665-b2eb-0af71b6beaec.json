Nothing is immediately blocking me at my current adjacent positions.\n\n### Potential Moves:\n\n1. **UP (1, 8):**\n   - **Pros:** Keeps me on track toward the apple at (2, 9). Safely moves upward without proximity to Snake #2's current body.\n   - **Cons:** Moving up again puts me a bit closer to Snake #2\u2019s head, though there\u2019s currently no immediate threat.\n\n2. **DOWN (1, 6):**\n   - **Cons:** Moves away from the target apple, reversing last move's progress. Generally a non-beneficial move.\n\n3. **LEFT (0, 7):**\n   - **Cons:** Moves away from any current apple, bringing me closer to the edge and potentially restricting options without strategic advantage.\n\n4. **RIGHT (2, 7):**\n   - **Pros:** Directly moves me towards the apple on (2, 9) while positioning me strategically closer to a clear path upward.\n\n### Enemy Snake Consideration:\n\n- Snake #2 is presently at (3, 8). Presuming it is also heading toward either the apple at (2, 9) or navigating freely, I must maintain awareness of space availability in that vertical and horizontal line.\n- Presuming Snake #2 will act in its interest without immediate threat instincts except proximity.\n\n### Conclusion and Strategy:\n\n- **Primary Goal:** Despite proximity to Snake #2, maximizing points through the apple acquirements should lead the decision. The significant goal is reaching (2, 9) and remaining vigilant about Snake #2's possible movements.\n- Observation of spatial changes based on enemy actions is crucial post-apple acquisition.\n\n**Next Move Decision: RIGHT**\n\n- **Strategy for Next Turn:** Post-move, emphasize situational re-assessment concerning Snake #2\u2019s position to evaluate directional options leading smoothly to the apple or safe spaces. Prioritize maintaining an advantageous distance from Snake 2\u2019s trajectory while holding target apple acquisition high. \n\nNext move: RIGHT"
