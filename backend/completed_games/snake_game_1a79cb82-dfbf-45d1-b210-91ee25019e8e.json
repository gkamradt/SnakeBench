            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,5). There are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (3,6), and (7,8). Oh, and there's an enemy snake at (9,6), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . A . . . . . 1\n\nRow 5: . . . 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,0): Row 9, Column 0\n\n- (7,9): Row 7, Column 9\n\n- (6,3): Row 6, Column 3\n\n- (3,6): Row 3, Column 6\n\n- (7,8): Row 7, Column 8\n\nAnd my snake is at (3,5): Row 3, Column 5\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,6): Row 9, Column 6, with no body parts.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about which apple to go for. I should consider which one is closest and which path is safest, avoiding the walls, myself, and the enemy snake.\n\nLet's look at the distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 0 - 5 = -5 (down)\n\n- Total moves: 6 + 5 = 11 moves\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: 7 - 3 = 4 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 9 - 5 = 4 (up)\n\n- Total moves: 4 + 4 = 8 moves\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: 6 - 3 = 3 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 3 - 5 = -2 (down)\n\n- Total moves: 3 + 2 = 5 moves\n\n4. (3,6):\n\n- Delta X: 3 - 3 = 0\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 5 = 1 (up)\n\n- Total moves: 0 + 1 = 1 move\n\n5. (7,8):\n\n- Delta X: 7 - 3 = 4 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 8 - 5 = 3 (up)\n\n- Total moves: 4 + 3 = 7 moves\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,6), which is just one move up from my current position. That seems promising.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Let's see:\n\nI'm at (3,5). Moving up to (3,6). Looking at the board, row 3, column 6 is an apple, which is fine\u2014I can eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I need to plan my next moves. Since I've grown, I need to make sure that my tail doesn't block my path.\n\nWait, but in this game, does the snake grow immediately after eating the apple, or does it take a turn to grow?\n\nI think in standard snake games, the growth happens immediately after eating the apple, so my tail would extend by one block.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm at (3,5), and I move to (3,6), and eat the apple, my tail would stay at (3,5), and I would have a new head at (3,6).\n\nBut I need to confirm if the growth happens immediately or after the next move.\n\nLet's assume that growth happens immediately after eating the apple, so my tail remains in place, and my body extends by one block.\n\nBut in reality, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail stays where it is, and you don't lose the last segment; instead, you gain a new segment, effectively growing longer.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail doesn't move forward immediately; it stays put until the rest of the snake has moved past it.\n\nHmm, this could be a bit confusing.\n\nLet me think differently. For now, let's assume that after eating an apple, my snake grows, and I have to make sure that I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut in this immediate move, since I'm just moving to (3,6), and assuming that growth happens after this move, I should be safe.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,6), and it has no body parts. So, it's just the head at (9,6).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't collide with it or with any part of its body. But since it has no body parts listed, maybe it's small.\n\nBut in snake games, usually, snakes have a body of at least one segment, which is the head.\n\nSo, I need to avoid its head at (9,6).\n\nBut in this turn, I'm at (3,5), and moving to (3,6), which is far from the enemy at (9,6). So, no issue there.\n\nBut I need to think about future moves and how the enemy might move.\n\nWait, but for now, I'm just deciding my next move.\n\nMaybe I should prioritize eating the closest apple, which is at (3,6).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for a different apple that might be less contested or have a clearer path.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (3,6) is right next to me, and there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLet me consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,6). It could move up, down, left, or right, but I don't know its strategy.\n\nIf I eat the apple at (3,6), I grow, and then I need to plan my path to the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for a different apple that might be easier to reach without crossing paths with the enemy.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6,3), which is at row 6, column 3.\n\nFrom my current position at (3,5), moving to (6,3) would require moving down two rows (since delta Y is 6 - 5 = 1, but I need to go to Y=3 from Y=5, which is down 2 rows) and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, no. My Y coordinates increase upwards, so from Y=5 to Y=3, that's down by 2 rows.\n\nAnd from X=3 to X=6, that's right by 3 columns.\n\nSo, move down 2, right 3.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,3), that's down 2 rows.\n\nThen from (3,3) to (6,3), that's right 3 columns.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in between.\n\nAlso, considering that I need to make multiple moves, and the enemy might be moving as well.\n\nThis seems complicated for just one move decision.\n\nMaybe I should stick with the closest apple, which is at (3,6), just one move up from my current position.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can reassess the situation.\n\nAdditionally, since the enemy is at (9,6), which is far away from my current position, and assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe for now.\n\nBut I need to think about the long term. If I eat the apple at (3,6), I grow, and then I need to navigate to another apple without hitting anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (7,8), which is at row 7, column 8.\n\nFrom (3,5), that's down 2 rows and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, no. From (3,5) to (7,8) is up 4 rows and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, Y increases upwards, so from Y=5 to Y=8 is up 3 rows.\n\nWait, Y=5 to Y=8 is up 3 rows (since 8-5=3).\n\nAnd X from 3 to 7 is right 4 columns.\n\nSo, total moves: 3 up and 4 right, totaling 7 moves.\n\nThat seems farther than the apple at (3,6), which is just 1 move up.\n\nAlso, moving to (3,6) doesn't require navigating around any obstacles, as far as I"

My Y coordinates increase upwards, so from Y=5 to Y=3, that's down by 2 rows.\n\nAnd from X=3 to X=6, that's right by 3 columns.\n\nSo, move down 2, right 3.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,3), that's down 2 rows.\n\nThen from (3,3) to (6,3), that's right 3 columns.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in between.\n\nAlso, considering that I need to make multiple moves, and the enemy might be moving as well.\n\nThis seems complicated for just one move decision.\n\nMaybe I should stick with the closest apple, which is at (3,6), just one move up from my current position.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can reassess the situation.\n\nAdditionally, since the enemy is at (9,6), which is far away from my current position, and assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe for now.\n\nBut I need to think about the long term. If I eat the apple at (3,6), I grow, and then I need to navigate to another apple without hitting anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (7,8), which is at row 7, column 8.\n\nFrom (3,5), that's down 2 rows and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, no. From (3,5) to (7,8) is up 4 rows and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, Y increases upwards, so from Y=5 to Y=8 is up 3 rows.\n\nWait, Y=5 to Y=8 is up 3 rows (since 8-5=3).\n\nAnd X from 3 to 7 is right 4 columns.\n\nSo, total moves: 3 up and 4 right, totaling 7 moves.\n\nThat seems farther than the apple at (3,6), which is just 1 move up.\n\nAlso, moving to (3,6) doesn't require navigating around any obstacles, as far as I"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,6). There are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2). There's also an enemy snake at (8,6) with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . 2 . . . . 1 .\n\nRow 5: . . . T . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (7,9)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (1,2)\n\nMy snake is at (3,6), which is row 3, column 6.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,6), which is row 8, column 6.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. I should consider the closest apple and the path to it, making sure it's safe and doesn't lead me into the enemy or a wall.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (3,6):\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: |9-3| = 6\n\n- Delta Y: |0-6| = 6\n\n- Total moves: 12\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |9-6| = 3\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: |6-3| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |3-6| = 3\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\n4. (7,8):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |8-6| = 2\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\n5. (1,2):\n\n- Delta X: |1-3| = 2\n\n- Delta Y: |2-6| = 4\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2), all with 6 moves.\n\nNow, I need to consider the paths to these apples and see which one is the safest.\n\nLet's look at each path:\n\n1. To (6,3):\n\n- From (3,6), go down to (6,6), then left to (6,3).\n\n- But looking at the board, there's an apple at (6,3), and an enemy snake at (8,6).\n\n- I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,6), which is below me at (3,6). So, going down to (6,6) might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\n- I need to see if the enemy is moving. But since I don't know its direction, I should assume it could move towards me.\n\n- Maybe it's better to avoid going down.\n\n2. To (7,8):\n\n- From (3,6), go right to (7,6), then up to (7,8).\n\n- Looking at the board, there's an apple at (7,9), but not directly in my path.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,6), which is to the right and down from my position.\n\n- If I go right to (7,6), I'm getting closer to the enemy.\n\n- Again, potential conflict with the enemy.\n\n3. To (1,2):\n\n- From (3,6), go left to (1,6), then down to (1,2).\n\n- The enemy is at (8,6), which is to the right, so moving left away from it seems safer.\n\n- Looking at the board, there's an apple at (1,2), and no immediate obstacles.\n\n- This seems like a safer path.\n\nAlso, considering that after eating an apple, I grow, so I need to make sure that my path after eating is clear.\n\nLet me think about growing.\n\nWhen I eat an apple, my snake grows by one segment. So, my tail will stay where it was until the rest of my body moves.\n\nI need to make sure that after eating, I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for the immediate move, I just need to ensure that the next move is safe.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (1,2) is the best option, as it's away from the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (3,6), which is right at my current position. Wait, no, that's where I am now.\n\nWait, no, the apples are at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2). I'm at (3,6), which is not an apple position.\n\nWait, in the board, there's an 'A' at (3,6), but in the list, it's (6,3). Maybe a typo.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nColumn 6, row 3 is apple, which is (6,3).\n\nI'm at (3,6), which is column 3, row 6.\n\nWait, I think there's a confusion in coordinates.\n\nWait, in the board, rows are from 9 to 0, with 9 at the top.\n\nColumns are 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nSo, position (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the apple positions, (6,3) is column 6, row 3.\n\nI need to be careful with coordinates.\n\nWait, perhaps the board is represented with rows from top to bottom, with row 9 at the top.\n\nSo, position (x,y), with x increasing to the right, y increasing upwards.\n\nSo, (3,6) is column 3, row 6 (from the bottom).\n\nBut in the board grid, row 9 is at the top, row 0 at the bottom.\n\nSo, y increases upwards.\n\nTherefore, my position is row 6, column 3.\n\nBut in the board grid, it's row 6, column 3.\n\nWait, but in the board description, it's row 3, column 6.\n\nI think there's confusion in row and column labels.\n\nTo clarify: if the board is shown with row 9 at the top and row 0 at the bottom, and columns 0 to 9 from left to right, then position (x,y) is column x, row y.\n\nSo, (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, it's represented as row number followed by the cells.\n\nSo, row 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nrow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\n...\n\nrow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nand columns 0 to 9.\n\nSo, position (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, it shows 'A' at row 3, column 6, which is position (6,3).\n\nWait, no, position (x,y): x is column, y is row.\n\nSo, (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, row 3, column 6 has an 'A', which is apple at (6,3).\n\nWait, this is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the coordinates are defined as (y,x) instead of (x,y).\n\nWait, in programming, coordinates are often (row, column), which is (y,x).\n\nLooking back, in the problem statement, it says: \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n\nSo, (x,y), with x increasing to the right, y increasing upwards.\n\nTherefore, position (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, row 3, column 6 has an 'A', which would be position (6,3).\n\nThis suggests a mismatch.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the board.\n\nLet me re-examine the board:\n\n 9 . . . . . . . A . .\n\n 8 . . . . . . . A . .\n\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 6 . . . 2 . . . . 1 .\n\n 5 . . . T . . . . . .\n\n 4 . . . . . . . ."

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,5). There are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (3,6), and (7,8). Oh, and there's an enemy snake at (9,6), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . A . . . . . 1\n\nRow 5: . . . 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . .

A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,0): Row 9, Column 0\n\n- (7,9): Row 7, Column 9\n\n- (6,3): Row 6, Column 3\n\n- (3,6): Row 3, Column 6\n\n- (7,8): Row 7, Column 8\n\nAnd my snake is at (3,5): Row 3, Column 5\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,6): Row 9, Column 6, with no body parts.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about which apple to go for. I should consider which one is closest and which path is safest, avoiding the walls, myself, and the enemy snake.\n\nLet's look at the distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 0 - 5 = -5 (down)\n\n- Total moves: 6 + 5 = 11 moves\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: 7 - 3 = 4 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 9 - 5 = 4 (up)\n\n- Total moves: 4 + 4 = 8 moves\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: 6 - 3 = 3 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 3 - 5 = -2 (down)\n\n- Total moves: 3 + 2 = 5 moves\n\n4. (3,6):\n\n- Delta X: 3 - 3 = 0\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 5 = 1 (up)\n\n- Total moves: 0 + 1 = 1 move\n\n5. (7,8):\n\n- Delta X: 7 - 3 = 4 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 8 - 5 = 3 (up)\n\n- Total moves: 4 + 3 = 7 moves\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,6), which is just one move up from my current position. That seems promising.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Let's see:\n\nI'm at (3,5). Moving up to (3,6). Looking at the board, row 3, column 6 is an apple, which is fine\u2014I can eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I need to plan my next moves. Since I've grown, I need to make sure that my tail doesn't block my path.\n\nWait, but in this game, does the snake grow immediately after eating the apple, or does it take a turn to grow?\n\nI think in standard snake games, the growth happens immediately after eating the apple, so my tail would extend by one block.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm at (3,5), and I move to (3,6), and eat the apple, my tail would stay at (3,5), and I would have a new head at (3,6).\n\nBut I need to confirm if the growth happens immediately or after the next move.\n\nLet's assume that growth happens immediately after eating the apple, so my tail remains in place, and my body extends by one block.\n\nBut in reality, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail stays where it is, and you don't lose the last segment; instead, you gain a new segment, effectively growing longer.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail doesn't move forward immediately; it stays put until the rest of the snake has moved past it.\n\nHmm, this could be a bit confusing.\n\nLet me think differently. For now, let's assume that after eating an apple, my snake grows, and I have to make sure that I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut in this immediate move, since I'm just moving to (3,6), and assuming that growth happens after this move, I should be safe.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,6), and it has no body parts. So, it's just the head at (9,6).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't collide with it or with any part of its body. But since it has no body parts listed, maybe it's small.\n\nBut in snake games, usually, snakes have a body of at least one segment, which is the head.\n\nSo, I need to avoid its head at (9,6).\n\nBut in this turn, I'm at (3,5), and moving to (3,6), which is far from the enemy at (9,6). So, no issue there.\n\nBut I need to think about future moves and how the enemy might move.\n\nWait, but for now, I'm just deciding my next move.\n\nMaybe I should prioritize eating the closest apple, which is at (3,6).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for a different apple that might be less contested or have a clearer path.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (3,6) is right next to me, and there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLet me consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,6). It could move up, down, left, or right, but I don't know its strategy.\n\nIf I eat the apple at (3,6), I grow, and then I need to plan my path to the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for a different apple that might be easier to reach without crossing paths with the enemy.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6,3), which is at row 6, column 3.\n\nFrom my current position at (3,5), moving to (6,3) would require moving down two rows (since delta Y is 6 - 5 = 1, but I need to go to Y=3 from Y=5, which is down 2 rows) and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, no. My Y coordinates increase upwards, so from Y=5 to Y=3, that's down by 2 rows.\n\nAnd from X=3 to X=6, that's right by 3 columns.\n\nSo, move down 2, right 3.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,3), that's down 2 rows.\n\nThen from (3,3) to (6,3), that's right 3 columns.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in between.\n\nAlso, considering that I need to make multiple moves, and the enemy might be moving as well.\n\nThis seems complicated for just one move decision.\n\nMaybe I should stick with the closest apple, which is at (3,6), just one move up from my current position.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can reassess the situation.\n\nAdditionally, since the enemy is at (9,6), which is far away from my current position, and assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe for now.\n\nBut I need to think about the long term. If I eat the apple at (3,6), I grow, and then I need to navigate to another apple without hitting anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (7,8), which is at row 7, column 8.\n\nFrom (3,5), that's down 2 rows and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, no. From (3,5) to (7,8) is up 4 rows and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, Y increases upwards, so from Y=5 to Y=8 is up 3 rows.\n\nWait, Y=5 to Y=8 is up 3 rows (since 8-5=3).\n\nAnd X from 3 to 7 is right 4 columns.\n\nSo, total moves: 3 up and 4 right, totaling 7 moves.\n\nThat seems farther than the apple at (3,6), which is just 1 move up.\n\nAlso, moving to (3,6) doesn't require navigating around any obstacles, as far as I"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,6). There are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2). There's also an enemy snake at (8,6) with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . 2 . . . . 1 .\n\nRow 5: . . . T . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (7,9)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (1,2)\n\nMy snake is at (3,6), which is row 3, column 6.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,6), which is row 8, column 6.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. I should consider the closest apple and the path to it, making sure it's safe and doesn't lead me into the enemy or a wall.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (3,6):\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: |9-3| = 6\n\n- Delta Y: |0-6| = 6\n\n- Total moves: 12\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |9-6| = 3\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: |6-3| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |3-6| = 3\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\n4. (7,8):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |8-6| = 2\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\n5. (1,2):\n\n- Delta X: |1-3| = 2\n\n- Delta Y: |2-6| = 4\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2), all with 6 moves.\n\nNow, I need to consider the paths to these apples and see which one is the safest.\n\nLet's look at each path:\n\n1. To (6,3):\n\n- From (3,6), go down to (6,6), then left to (6,3).\n\n- But looking at the board, there's an apple at (6,3), and an enemy snake at (8,6).\n\n- I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,6), which is below me at (3,6). So, going down to (6,6) might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\n- I need to see if the enemy is moving. But since I don't know its direction, I should assume it could move towards me.\n\n- Maybe it's better to avoid going down.\n\n2. To (7,8):\n\n- From (3,6), go right to (7,6), then up to (7,8).\n\n- Looking at the board, there's an apple at (7,9), but not directly in my path.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,6), which is to the right and down from my position.\n\n- If I go right to (7,6), I'm getting closer to the enemy.\n\n- Again, potential conflict with the enemy.\n\n3. To (1,2):\n\n- From (3,6), go left to (1,6), then down to (1,2).\n\n- The enemy is at (8,6), which is to the right, so moving left away from it seems safer.\n\n- Looking at the board, there's an apple at (1,2), and no immediate obstacles.\n\n- This seems like a safer path.\n\nAlso, considering that after eating an apple, I grow, so I need to make sure that my path after eating is clear.\n\nLet me think about growing.\n\nWhen I eat an apple, my snake grows by one segment. So, my tail will stay where it was until the rest of my body moves.\n\nI need to make sure that after eating, I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for the immediate move, I just need to ensure that the next move is safe.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (1,2) is the best option, as it's away from the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (3,6), which is right at my current position. Wait, no, that's where I am now.\n\nWait, no, the apples are at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2). I'm at (3,6), which is not an apple position.\n\nWait, in the board, there's an 'A' at (3,6), but in the list, it's (6,3). Maybe a typo.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nColumn 6, row 3 is apple, which is (6,3).\n\nI'm at (3,6), which is column 3, row 6.\n\nWait, I think there's a confusion in coordinates.\n\nWait, in the board, rows are from 9 to 0, with 9 at the top.\n\nColumns are 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nSo, position (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the apple positions, (6,3) is column 6, row 3.\n\nI need to be careful with coordinates.\n\nWait, perhaps the board is represented with rows from top to bottom, with row 9 at the top.\n\nSo, position (x,y), with x increasing to the right, y increasing upwards.\n\nSo, (3,6) is column 3, row 6 (from the bottom).\n\nBut in the board grid, row 9 is at the top, row 0 at the bottom.\n\nSo, y increases upwards.\n\nTherefore, my position is row 6, column 3.\n\nBut in the board grid, it's row 6, column 3.\n\nWait, but in the board description, it's row 3, column 6.\n\nI think there's confusion in row and column labels.\n\nTo clarify: if the board is shown with row 9 at the top and row 0 at the bottom, and columns 0 to 9 from left to right, then position (x,y) is column x, row y.\n\nSo, (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, it's represented as row number followed by the cells.\n\nSo, row 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nrow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\n...\n\nrow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nand columns 0 to 9.\n\nSo, position (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, it shows 'A' at row 3, column 6, which is position (6,3).\n\nWait, no, position (x,y): x is column, y is row.\n\nSo, (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, row 3, column 6 has an 'A', which is apple at (6,3).\n\nWait, this is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the coordinates are defined as (y,x) instead of (x,y).\n\nWait, in programming, coordinates are often (row, column), which is (y,x).\n\nLooking back, in the problem statement, it says: \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n\nSo, (x,y), with x increasing to the right, y increasing upwards.\n\nTherefore, position (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, row 3, column 6 has an 'A', which would be position (6,3).\n\nThis suggests a mismatch.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the board.\n\nLet me re-examine the board:\n\n 9 . . . . . . . A . .\n\n 8 . . . . . . . A . .\n\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 6 . . . 2 . . . . 1 .\n\n 5 . . . T . . . . . .\n\n 4 . . . . . . . ."

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to make my next move. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board setup. The board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,7). There are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2). There's also an enemy snake at (8,7), with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nLet me try to visualize this board. From the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . 2 . . . . 1 .\n\nRow 6: . . . T . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: .

The enemy snake is at (8,7), which is column 8, row 7.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, so I should consider which one is closest and safest to reach.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: |9-3| = 6\n\n- Delta Y: |0-7| = 7\n\n- Total moves: 13\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |9-7| = 2\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: |6-3| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |3-7| = 4\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\n4. (7,8):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |8-7| = 1\n\n- Total moves: 5\n\n5. (1,2):\n\n- Delta X: |1-3| = 2\n\n- Delta Y: |2-7| = 5\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,8) with 5 moves, followed by (7,9) at 6 moves, and the others at 7 moves.\n\nNow, I need to think about the path to each apple and consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (7,8):\n\n- From (3,7), I need to move right to (7,7), then up to (7,8).\n\n- But the enemy snake is at (8,7), which is to the right of my target position.\n\n- I need to make sure the enemy doesn't block my path or intercept me.\n\n- The enemy is only one position away from my path, at (8,7).\n\n- If the enemy moves left, it could potentially block my path.\n\n- However, I can reach (7,7) before the enemy can reach it from (8,7), assuming it takes one move.\n\n- So, it might be safe to go for (7,8).\n\nNext, the apple at (7,9):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (7,7), then up to (7,9).\n\n- That's a total of 4 right moves and 2 up moves, totaling 6 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is adjacent to my path.\n\n- Similar to the previous apple, the enemy could potentially block my path, but I should reach (7,7) first.\n\n- Perhaps still manageable.\n\nThe apple at (6,3):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (6,7), then down to (6,3).\n\n- That's 3 right moves and 4 down moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is below and to the right.\n\n- Less likely to interfere with this path.\n\n- However, moving down exposes me to the enemy if it moves down as well.\n\nThe apple at (1,2):\n\n- From (3,7), move left to (1,7), then down to (1,2).\n\n- That's 2 left moves and 5 down moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is to the right.\n\n- Moving left seems safer, as the enemy is to the right.\n\n- But I need to ensure that there are no other obstacles or that the enemy doesn't move towards me.\n\nThe apple at (9,0):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (9,7), then down to (9,0).\n\n- That's 6 right moves and 7 down moves, totaling 13 moves.\n\n- That's a long path, and the enemy could potentially intercept me.\n\nGiven these options, the apple at (7,8) seems the closest, requiring only 5 moves. Although the enemy is nearby, I believe I can reach it before the enemy can block my path.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves to get to (7,8):\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move right to (7,7)\n\n5. Move up to (7,8)\n\nEach move takes one turn, so in 5 moves, I can reach (7,8).\n\nNow, considering the enemy is at (8,7). If it moves left, it could reach (7,7) in one move, which would be concurrent with my arrival at (7,7). But since I need to move to (7,8) from (7,7), and the enemy is at (7,7), I need to make sure I can move to (7,8) without collision.\n\nIn Snake games, if two snakes occupy the same space, the longer snake survives, or both die, depending on the rules. But in this case, since we're both head-to-head, and assuming standard Snake rules, if we both move into the same space, we both die.\n\nTherefore, I need to avoid such a collision.\n\nTo prevent this, I can try to reach (7,8) before the enemy can reach (7,7). But since we both can move there in one move, it's a race.\n\nPerhaps I should consider another path or another apple to avoid this risk.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to trick the enemy into moving away by feinting a different direction.\n\nBut since I don't have control over the enemy's movements, I need to plan based on possible scenarios.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (7,9) instead.\n\nPath to (7,9):\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move right to (7,7)\n\n5. Move up to (7,8)\n\n6. Move up to (7,9)\n\nThat's 6 moves, which is more than the 5 moves to (7,8), but it might be safer because it's higher up, away from the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,7), so if I go to (7,9), the enemy would have to move up twice to reach (8,9), which is not directly in my path.\n\nTherefore, going for (7,9) might be a safer option.\n\nAlternatively, consider the apple at (6,3), which is at (6,3):\n\nPath:\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move down to (6,6)\n\n5. Move down to (6,5)\n\n6. Move down to (6,4)\n\n7. Move down to (6,3)\n\nThat's 7 moves, which is longer, but the enemy is at (8,7), which is below me, so moving down might expose me to the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (8,7), which is below me at (3,7). So moving down brings me closer to the enemy.\n\nThat might not be a good idea.\n\nNow, consider the apple at (1,2):\n\nPath:\n\n1. Move left to (2,7)\n\n2. Move left to (1,7)\n\n3. Move down to (1,6)\n\n4. Move down to (1,5)\n\n5. Move down to (1,4)\n\n6. Move down to (1,3)\n\n7. Move down to (1,2)\n\nThat's 7 moves as well.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,7), which is to the right and below me.\n\nMoving left away from the enemy seems safer.\n\nBut I need to ensure"

A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . A . . . . . 1\n\nRow 5: . . . 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,0): Row 9, Column 0\n\n- (7,9): Row 7, Column 9\n\n- (6,3): Row 6, Column 3\n\n- (3,6): Row 3, Column 6\n\n- (7,8): Row 7, Column 8\n\nAnd my snake is at (3,5): Row 3, Column 5\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,6): Row 9, Column 6, with no body parts.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about which apple to go for. I should consider which one is closest and which path is safest, avoiding the walls, myself, and the enemy snake.\n\nLet's look at the distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 0 - 5 = -5 (down)\n\n- Total moves: 6 + 5 = 11 moves\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: 7 - 3 = 4 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 9 - 5 = 4 (up)\n\n- Total moves: 4 + 4 = 8 moves\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: 6 - 3 = 3 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 3 - 5 = -2 (down)\n\n- Total moves: 3 + 2 = 5 moves\n\n4. (3,6):\n\n- Delta X: 3 - 3 = 0\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 5 = 1 (up)\n\n- Total moves: 0 + 1 = 1 move\n\n5. (7,8):\n\n- Delta X: 7 - 3 = 4 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 8 - 5 = 3 (up)\n\n- Total moves: 4 + 3 = 7 moves\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,6), which is just one move up from my current position. That seems promising.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Let's see:\n\nI'm at (3,5). Moving up to (3,6). Looking at the board, row 3, column 6 is an apple, which is fine\u2014I can eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I need to plan my next moves. Since I've grown, I need to make sure that my tail doesn't block my path.\n\nWait, but in this game, does the snake grow immediately after eating the apple, or does it take a turn to grow?\n\nI think in standard snake games, the growth happens immediately after eating the apple, so my tail would extend by one block.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm at (3,5), and I move to (3,6), and eat the apple, my tail would stay at (3,5), and I would have a new head at (3,6).\n\nBut I need to confirm if the growth happens immediately or after the next move.\n\nLet's assume that growth happens immediately after eating the apple, so my tail remains in place, and my body extends by one block.\n\nBut in reality, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail stays where it is, and you don't lose the last segment; instead, you gain a new segment, effectively growing longer.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail doesn't move forward immediately; it stays put until the rest of the snake has moved past it.\n\nHmm, this could be a bit confusing.\n\nLet me think differently. For now, let's assume that after eating an apple, my snake grows, and I have to make sure that I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut in this immediate move, since I'm just moving to (3,6), and assuming that growth happens after this move, I should be safe.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,6), and it has no body parts. So, it's just the head at (9,6).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't collide with it or with any part of its body. But since it has no body parts listed, maybe it's small.\n\nBut in snake games, usually, snakes have a body of at least one segment, which is the head.\n\nSo, I need to avoid its head at (9,6).\n\nBut in this turn, I'm at (3,5), and moving to (3,6), which is far from the enemy at (9,6). So, no issue there.\n\nBut I need to think about future moves and how the enemy might move.\n\nWait, but for now, I'm just deciding my next move.\n\nMaybe I should prioritize eating the closest apple, which is at (3,6).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for a different apple that might be less contested or have a clearer path.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (3,6) is right next to me, and there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLet me consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,6). It could move up, down, left, or right, but I don't know its strategy.\n\nIf I eat the apple at (3,6), I grow, and then I need to plan my path to the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for a different apple that might be easier to reach without crossing paths with the enemy.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6,3), which is at row 6, column 3.\n\nFrom my current position at (3,5), moving to (6,3) would require moving down two rows (since delta Y is 6 - 5 = 1, but I need to go to Y=3 from Y=5, which is down 2 rows) and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, no. My Y coordinates increase upwards, so from Y=5 to Y=3, that's down by 2 rows.\n\nAnd from X=3 to X=6, that's right by 3 columns.\n\nSo, move down 2, right 3.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,3), that's down 2 rows.\n\nThen from (3,3) to (6,3), that's right 3 columns.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in between.\n\nAlso, considering that I need to make multiple moves, and the enemy might be moving as well.\n\nThis seems complicated for just one move decision.\n\nMaybe I should stick with the closest apple, which is at (3,6), just one move up from my current position.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can reassess the situation.\n\nAdditionally, since the enemy is at (9,6), which is far away from my current position, and assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe for now.\n\nBut I need to think about the long term. If I eat the apple at (3,6), I grow, and then I need to navigate to another apple without hitting anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (7,8), which is at row 7, column 8.\n\nFrom (3,5), that's down 2 rows and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, no. From (3,5) to (7,8) is up 4 rows and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, Y increases upwards, so from Y=5 to Y=8 is up 3 rows.\n\nWait, Y=5 to Y=8 is up 3 rows (since 8-5=3).\n\nAnd X from 3 to 7 is right 4 columns.\n\nSo, total moves: 3 up and 4 right, totaling 7 moves.\n\nThat seems farther than the apple at (3,6), which is just 1 move up.\n\nAlso, moving to (3,6) doesn't require navigating around any obstacles, as far as I"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,6). There are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2). There's also an enemy snake at (8,6) with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . 2 . . . . 1 .\n\nRow 5: . . . T . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (7,9)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (1,2)\n\nMy snake is at (3,6), which is row 3, column 6.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,6), which is row 8, column 6.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. I should consider the closest apple and the path to it, making sure it's safe and doesn't lead me into the enemy or a wall.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (3,6):\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: |9-3| = 6\n\n- Delta Y: |0-6| = 6\n\n- Total moves: 12\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |9-6| = 3\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: |6-3| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |3-6| = 3\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\n4. (7,8):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |8-6| = 2\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\n5. (1,2):\n\n- Delta X: |1-3| = 2\n\n- Delta Y: |2-6| = 4\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2), all with 6 moves.\n\nNow, I need to consider the paths to these apples and see which one is the safest.\n\nLet's look at each path:\n\n1. To (6,3):\n\n- From (3,6), go down to (6,6), then left to (6,3).\n\n- But looking at the board, there's an apple at (6,3), and an enemy snake at (8,6).\n\n- I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,6), which is below me at (3,6). So, going down to (6,6) might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\n- I need to see if the enemy is moving. But since I don't know its direction, I should assume it could move towards me.\n\n- Maybe it's better to avoid going down.\n\n2. To (7,8):\n\n- From (3,6), go right to (7,6), then up to (7,8).\n\n- Looking at the board, there's an apple at (7,9), but not directly in my path.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,6), which is to the right and down from my position.\n\n- If I go right to (7,6), I'm getting closer to the enemy.\n\n- Again, potential conflict with the enemy.\n\n3. To (1,2):\n\n- From (3,6), go left to (1,6), then down to (1,2).\n\n- The enemy is at (8,6), which is to the right, so moving left away from it seems safer.\n\n- Looking at the board, there's an apple at (1,2), and no immediate obstacles.\n\n- This seems like a safer path.\n\nAlso, considering that after eating an apple, I grow, so I need to make sure that my path after eating is clear.\n\nLet me think about growing.\n\nWhen I eat an apple, my snake grows by one segment. So, my tail will stay where it was until the rest of my body moves.\n\nI need to make sure that after eating, I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for the immediate move, I just need to ensure that the next move is safe.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (1,2) is the best option, as it's away from the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (3,6), which is right at my current position. Wait, no, that's where I am now.\n\nWait, no, the apples are at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2). I'm at (3,6), which is not an apple position.\n\nWait, in the board, there's an 'A' at (3,6), but in the list, it's (6,3). Maybe a typo.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nColumn 6, row 3 is apple, which is (6,3).\n\nI'm at (3,6), which is column 3, row 6.\n\nWait, I think there's a confusion in coordinates.\n\nWait, in the board, rows are from 9 to 0, with 9 at the top.\n\nColumns are 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nSo, position (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the apple positions, (6,3) is column 6, row 3.\n\nI need to be careful with coordinates.\n\nWait, perhaps the board is represented with rows from top to bottom, with row 9 at the top.\n\nSo, position (x,y), with x increasing to the right, y increasing upwards.\n\nSo, (3,6) is column 3, row 6 (from the bottom).\n\nBut in the board grid, row 9 is at the top, row 0 at the bottom.\n\nSo, y increases upwards.\n\nTherefore, my position is row 6, column 3.\n\nBut in the board grid, it's row 6, column 3.\n\nWait, but in the board description, it's row 3, column 6.\n\nI think there's confusion in row and column labels.\n\nTo clarify: if the board is shown with row 9 at the top and row 0 at the bottom, and columns 0 to 9 from left to right, then position (x,y) is column x, row y.\n\nSo, (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, it's represented as row number followed by the cells.\n\nSo, row 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nrow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\n...\n\nrow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nand columns 0 to 9.\n\nSo, position (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, it shows 'A' at row 3, column 6, which is position (6,3).\n\nWait, no, position (x,y): x is column, y is row.\n\nSo, (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, row 3, column 6 has an 'A', which is apple at (6,3).\n\nWait, this is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the coordinates are defined as (y,x) instead of (x,y).\n\nWait, in programming, coordinates are often (row, column), which is (y,x).\n\nLooking back, in the problem statement, it says: \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n\nSo, (x,y), with x increasing to the right, y increasing upwards.\n\nTherefore, position (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, row 3, column 6 has an 'A', which would be position (6,3).\n\nThis suggests a mismatch.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the board.\n\nLet me re-examine the board:\n\n 9 . . . . . . . A . .\n\n 8 . . . . . . . A . .\n\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 6 . . . 2 . . . . 1 .\n\n 5 . . . T . . . . . .\n\n 4 . . . . . . . ."

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to make my next move. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board setup. The board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,7). There are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2). There's also an enemy snake at (8,7), with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nLet me try to visualize this board. From the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . 2 . . . . 1 .\n\nRow 6: . . . T . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: .

The enemy snake is at (8,7), which is column 8, row 7.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, so I should consider which one is closest and safest to reach.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: |9-3| = 6\n\n- Delta Y: |0-7| = 7\n\n- Total moves: 13\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |9-7| = 2\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: |6-3| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |3-7| = 4\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\n4. (7,8):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |8-7| = 1\n\n- Total moves: 5\n\n5. (1,2):\n\n- Delta X: |1-3| = 2\n\n- Delta Y: |2-7| = 5\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,8) with 5 moves, followed by (7,9) at 6 moves, and the others at 7 moves.\n\nNow, I need to think about the path to each apple and consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (7,8):\n\n- From (3,7), I need to move right to (7,7), then up to (7,8).\n\n- But the enemy snake is at (8,7), which is to the right of my target position.\n\n- I need to make sure the enemy doesn't block my path or intercept me.\n\n- The enemy is only one position away from my path, at (8,7).\n\n- If the enemy moves left, it could potentially block my path.\n\n- However, I can reach (7,7) before the enemy can reach it from (8,7), assuming it takes one move.\n\n- So, it might be safe to go for (7,8).\n\nNext, the apple at (7,9):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (7,7), then up to (7,9).\n\n- That's a total of 4 right moves and 2 up moves, totaling 6 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is adjacent to my path.\n\n- Similar to the previous apple, the enemy could potentially block my path, but I should reach (7,7) first.\n\n- Perhaps still manageable.\n\nThe apple at (6,3):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (6,7), then down to (6,3).\n\n- That's 3 right moves and 4 down moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is below and to the right.\n\n- Less likely to interfere with this path.\n\n- However, moving down exposes me to the enemy if it moves down as well.\n\nThe apple at (1,2):\n\n- From (3,7), move left to (1,7), then down to (1,2).\n\n- That's 2 left moves and 5 down moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is to the right.\n\n- Moving left seems safer, as the enemy is to the right.\n\n- But I need to ensure that there are no other obstacles or that the enemy doesn't move towards me.\n\nThe apple at (9,0):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (9,7), then down to (9,0).\n\n- That's 6 right moves and 7 down moves, totaling 13 moves.\n\n- That's a long path, and the enemy could potentially intercept me.\n\nGiven these options, the apple at (7,8) seems the closest, requiring only 5 moves. Although the enemy is nearby, I believe I can reach it before the enemy can block my path.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves to get to (7,8):\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move right to (7,7)\n\n5. Move up to (7,8)\n\nEach move takes one turn, so in 5 moves, I can reach (7,8).\n\nNow, considering the enemy is at (8,7). If it moves left, it could reach (7,7) in one move, which would be concurrent with my arrival at (7,7). But since I need to move to (7,8) from (7,7), and the enemy is at (7,7), I need to make sure I can move to (7,8) without collision.\n\nIn Snake games, if two snakes occupy the same space, the longer snake survives, or both die, depending on the rules. But in this case, since we're both head-to-head, and assuming standard Snake rules, if we both move into the same space, we both die.\n\nTherefore, I need to avoid such a collision.\n\nTo prevent this, I can try to reach (7,8) before the enemy can reach (7,7). But since we both can move there in one move, it's a race.\n\nPerhaps I should consider another path or another apple to avoid this risk.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to trick the enemy into moving away by feinting a different direction.\n\nBut since I don't have control over the enemy's movements, I need to plan based on possible scenarios.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (7,9) instead.\n\nPath to (7,9):\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move right to (7,7)\n\n5. Move up to (7,8)\n\n6. Move up to (7,9)\n\nThat's 6 moves, which is more than the 5 moves to (7,8), but it might be safer because it's higher up, away from the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,7), so if I go to (7,9), the enemy would have to move up twice to reach (8,9), which is not directly in my path.\n\nTherefore, going for (7,9) might be a safer option.\n\nAlternatively, consider the apple at (6,3), which is at (6,3):\n\nPath:\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move down to (6,6)\n\n5. Move down to (6,5)\n\n6. Move down to (6,4)\n\n7. Move down to (6,3)\n\nThat's 7 moves, which is longer, but the enemy is at (8,7), which is below me, so moving down might expose me to the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (8,7), which is below me at (3,7). So moving down brings me closer to the enemy.\n\nThat might not be a good idea.\n\nNow, consider the apple at (1,2):\n\nPath:\n\n1. Move left to (2,7)\n\n2. Move left to (1,7)\n\n3. Move down to (1,6)\n\n4. Move down to (1,5)\n\n5. Move down to (1,4)\n\n6. Move down to (1,3)\n\n7. Move down to (1,2)\n\nThat's 7 moves as well.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,7), which is to the right and below me.\n\nMoving left away from the enemy seems safer.\n\nBut I need to ensure"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to make my next move. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board setup. The board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,7). There are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2). There's also an enemy snake at (8,7), with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nLet me try to visualize this board. From the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . 2 . . . . 1 .\n\nRow 6: . . . T . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (3,7), which is column 3, row 7. The enemy snake is at (8,7), which is column 8, row 7.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, so I should consider which one is closest and safest to reach.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: |9-3| = 6\n\n- Delta Y: |0-7| = 7\n\n- Total moves: 13\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |9-7| = 2\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: |6-3| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |3-7| = 4\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\n4. (7,8):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |8-7| = 1\n\n- Total moves: 5\n\n5. (1,2):\n\n- Delta X: |1-3| = 2\n\n- Delta Y: |2-7| = 5\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,8) with 5 moves, followed by (7,9) at 6 moves, and the others at 7 moves.\n\nNow, I need to think about the path to each apple and consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (7,8):\n\n- From (3,7), I need to move right to (7,7), then up to (7,8).\n\n- But the enemy snake is at (8,7), which is to the right of my target position.\n\n- I need to make sure the enemy doesn't block my path or intercept me.\n\n- The enemy is only one position away from my path, at (8,7).\n\n- If the enemy moves left, it could potentially block my path.\n\n- However, I can reach (7,7) before the enemy can reach it from (8,7), assuming it takes one move.\n\n- So, it might be safe to go for (7,8).\n\nNext, the apple at (7,9):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (7,7), then up to (7,9).\n\n- That's a total of 4 right moves and 2 up moves, totaling 6 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is adjacent to my path.\n\n- Similar to the previous apple, the enemy could potentially block my path, but I should reach (7,7) first.\n\n- Perhaps still manageable.\n\nThe apple at (6,3):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (6,7), then down to (6,3).\n\n- That's 3 right moves and 4 down moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is below and to the right.\n\n- Less likely to interfere with this path.\n\n- However, moving down exposes me to the enemy if it moves down as well.\n\nThe apple at (1,2):\n\n- From (3,7), move left to (1,7), then down to (1,2).\n\n- That's 2 left moves and 5 down moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is to the right.\n\n- Moving left seems safer, as the enemy is to the right.\n\n- But I need to ensure that there are no other obstacles or that the enemy doesn't move towards me.\n\nThe apple at (9,0):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (9,7), then down to (9,0).\n\n- That's 6 right moves and 7 down moves, totaling 13 moves.\n\n- That's a long path, and the enemy could potentially intercept me.\n\nGiven these options, the apple at (7,8) seems the closest, requiring only 5 moves. Although the enemy is nearby, I believe I can reach it before the enemy can block my path.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves to get to (7,8):\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move right to (7,7)\n\n5. Move up to (7,8)\n\nEach move takes one turn, so in 5 moves, I can reach (7,8).\n\nNow, considering the enemy is at (8,7). If it moves left, it could reach (7,7) in one move, which would be concurrent with my arrival at (7,7). But since I need to move to (7,8) from (7,7), and the enemy is at (7,7), I need to make sure I can move to (7,8) without collision.\n\nIn Snake games, if two snakes occupy the same space, the longer snake survives, or both die, depending on the rules.

Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move right to (7,7)\n\n5. Move up to (7,8)\n\n6. Move up to (7,9)\n\nThat's 6 moves, which is more than the 5 moves to (7,8), but it might be safer because it's higher up, away from the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,7), so if I go to (7,9), the enemy would have to move up twice to reach (8,9), which is not directly in my path.\n\nTherefore, going for (7,9) might be a safer option.\n\nAlternatively, consider the apple at (6,3), which is at (6,3):\n\nPath:\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move down to (6,6)\n\n5. Move down to (6,5)\n\n6. Move down to (6,4)\n\n7. Move down to (6,3)\n\nThat's 7 moves, which is longer, but the enemy is at (8,7), which is below me, so moving down might expose me to the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (8,7), which is below me at (3,7). So moving down brings me closer to the enemy.\n\nThat might not be a good idea.\n\nNow, consider the apple at (1,2):\n\nPath:\n\n1. Move left to (2,7)\n\n2. Move left to (1,7)\n\n3. Move down to (1,6)\n\n4. Move down to (1,5)\n\n5. Move down to (1,4)\n\n6. Move down to (1,3)\n\n7. Move down to (1,2)\n\nThat's 7 moves as well.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,7), which is to the right and below me.\n\nMoving left away from the enemy seems safer.\n\nBut I need to ensure"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,5). There are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (3,6), and (7,8). Oh, and there's an enemy snake at (9,6), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . A . . . . . 1\n\nRow 5: . . . 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,0): Row 9, Column 0\n\n- (7,9): Row 7, Column 9\n\n- (6,3): Row 6, Column 3\n\n- (3,6): Row 3, Column 6\n\n- (7,8): Row 7, Column 8\n\nAnd my snake is at (3,5): Row 3, Column 5\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,6): Row 9, Column 6, with no body parts.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about which apple to go for. I should consider which one is closest and which path is safest, avoiding the walls, myself, and the enemy snake.\n\nLet's look at the distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 0 - 5 = -5 (down)\n\n- Total moves: 6 + 5 = 11 moves\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: 7 - 3 = 4 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 9 - 5 = 4 (up)\n\n- Total moves: 4 + 4 = 8 moves\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: 6 - 3 = 3 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 3 - 5 = -2 (down)\n\n- Total moves: 3 + 2 = 5 moves\n\n4. (3,6):\n\n- Delta X: 3 - 3 = 0\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 5 = 1 (up)\n\n- Total moves: 0 + 1 = 1 move\n\n5. (7,8):\n\n- Delta X: 7 - 3 = 4 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 8 - 5 = 3 (up)\n\n- Total moves: 4 + 3 = 7 moves\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,6), which is just one move up from my current position. That seems promising.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Let's see:\n\nI'm at (3,5). Moving up to (3,6). Looking at the board, row 3, column 6 is an apple, which is fine\u2014I can eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I need to plan my next moves. Since I've grown, I need to make sure that my tail doesn't block my path.\n\nWait, but in this game, does the snake grow immediately after eating the apple, or does it take a turn to grow?\n\nI think in standard snake games, the growth happens immediately after eating the apple, so my tail would extend by one block.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm at (3,5), and I move to (3,6), and eat the apple, my tail would stay at (3,5), and I would have a new head at (3,6).\n\nBut I need to confirm if the growth happens immediately or after the next move.\n\nLet's assume that growth happens immediately after eating the apple, so my tail remains in place, and my body extends by one block.\n\nBut in reality, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail stays where it is, and you don't lose the last segment; instead, you gain a new segment, effectively growing longer.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail doesn't move forward immediately; it stays put until the rest of the snake has moved past it.\n\nHmm, this could be a bit confusing.\n\nLet me think differently. For now, let's assume that after eating an apple, my snake grows, and I have to make sure that I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut in this immediate move, since I'm just moving to (3,6), and assuming that growth happens after this move, I should be safe.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,6), and it has no body parts. So, it's just the head at (9,6).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't collide with it or with any part of its body. But since it has no body parts listed, maybe it's small.\n\nBut in snake games, usually, snakes have a body of at least one segment, which is the head.\n\nSo, I need to avoid its head at (9,6).\n\nBut in this turn, I'm at (3,5), and moving to (3,6), which is far from the enemy at (9,6). So, no issue there.\n\nBut I need to think about future moves and how the enemy might move.\n\nWait, but for now, I'm just deciding my next move.\n\nMaybe I should prioritize eating the closest apple, which is at (3,6).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for a different apple that might be less contested or have a clearer path.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (3,6) is right next to me, and there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLet me consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,6). It could move up, down, left, or right, but I don't know its strategy.\n\nIf I eat the apple at (3,6), I grow, and then I need to plan my path to the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for a different apple that might be easier to reach without crossing paths with the enemy.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6,3), which is at row 6, column 3.\n\nFrom my current position at (3,5), moving to (6,3) would require moving down two rows (since delta Y is 6 - 5 = 1, but I need to go to Y=3 from Y=5, which is down 2 rows) and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, no. My Y coordinates increase upwards, so from Y=5 to Y=3, that's down by 2 rows.\n\nAnd from X=3 to X=6, that's right by 3 columns.\n\nSo, move down 2, right 3.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,3), that's down 2 rows.\n\nThen from (3,3) to (6,3), that's right 3 columns.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in between.\n\nAlso, considering that I need to make multiple moves, and the enemy might be moving as well.\n\nThis seems complicated for just one move decision.\n\nMaybe I should stick with the closest apple, which is at (3,6), just one move up from my current position.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can reassess the situation.\n\nAdditionally, since the enemy is at (9,6), which is far away from my current position, and assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe for now.\n\nBut I need to think about the long term. If I eat the apple at (3,6), I grow, and then I need to navigate to another apple without hitting anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (7,8), which is at row 7, column 8.\n\nFrom (3,5), that's down 2 rows and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, no. From (3,5) to (7,8) is up 4 rows and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, Y increases upwards, so from Y=5 to Y=8 is up 3 rows.\n\nWait, Y=5 to Y=8 is up 3 rows (since 8-5=3).\n\nAnd X from 3 to 7 is right 4 columns.\n\nSo, total moves: 3 up and 4 right, totaling 7 moves.\n\nThat seems farther than the apple at (3,6), which is just 1 move up.\n\nAlso, moving to (3,6) doesn't require navigating around any obstacles, as far as I"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,6). There are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2). There's also an enemy snake at (8,6) with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . 2 . . . . 1 .\n\nRow 5: . . . T . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (7,9)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (1,2)\n\nMy snake is at (3,6), which is row 3, column 6.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,6), which is row 8, column 6.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. I should consider the closest apple and the path to it, making sure it's safe and doesn't lead me into the enemy or a wall.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (3,6):\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: |9-3| = 6\n\n- Delta Y: |0-6| = 6\n\n- Total moves: 12\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |9-6| = 3\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: |6-3| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |3-6| = 3\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\n4. (7,8):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |8-6| = 2\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\n5. (1,2):\n\n- Delta X: |1-3| = 2\n\n- Delta Y: |2-6| = 4\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2), all with 6 moves.\n\nNow, I need to consider the paths to these apples and see which one is the safest.\n\nLet's look at each path:\n\n1. To (6,3):\n\n- From (3,6), go down to (6,6), then left to (6,3).\n\n- But looking at the board, there's an apple at (6,3), and an enemy snake at (8,6).\n\n- I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,6), which is below me at (3,6). So, going down to (6,6) might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\n- I need to see if the enemy is moving. But since I don't know its direction, I should assume it could move towards me.\n\n- Maybe it's better to avoid going down.\n\n2. To (7,8):\n\n- From (3,6), go right to (7,6), then up to (7,8).\n\n- Looking at the board, there's an apple at (7,9), but not directly in my path.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,6), which is to the right and down from my position.\n\n- If I go right to (7,6), I'm getting closer to the enemy.\n\n- Again, potential conflict with the enemy.\n\n3. To (1,2):\n\n- From (3,6), go left to (1,6), then down to (1,2).\n\n- The enemy is at (8,6), which is to the right, so moving left away from it seems safer.\n\n- Looking at the board, there's an apple at (1,2), and no immediate obstacles.\n\n- This seems like a safer path.\n\nAlso, considering that after eating an apple, I grow, so I need to make sure that my path after eating is clear.\n\nLet me think about growing.\n\nWhen I eat an apple, my snake grows by one segment. So, my tail will stay where it was until the rest of my body moves.\n\nI need to make sure that after eating, I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for the immediate move, I just need to ensure that the next move is safe.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (1,2) is the best option, as it's away from the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (3,6), which is right at my current position. Wait, no, that's where I am now.\n\nWait, no, the apples are at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2). I'm at (3,6), which is not an apple position.\n\nWait, in the board, there's an 'A' at (3,6), but in the list, it's (6,3). Maybe a typo.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nColumn 6, row 3 is apple, which is (6,3).\n\nI'm at (3,6), which is column 3, row 6.\n\nWait, I think there's a confusion in coordinates.\n\nWait, in the board, rows are from 9 to 0, with 9 at the top.\n\nColumns are 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nSo, position (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the apple positions, (6,3) is column 6, row 3.\n\nI need to be careful with coordinates.\n\nWait, perhaps the board is represented with rows from top to bottom, with row 9 at the top.\n\nSo, position (x,y), with x increasing to the right, y increasing upwards.\n\nSo, (3,6) is column 3, row 6 (from the bottom).\n\nBut in the board grid, row 9 is at the top, row 0 at the bottom.\n\nSo, y increases upwards.\n\nTherefore, my position is row 6, column 3.\n\nBut in the board grid, it's row 6, column 3.\n\nWait, but in the board description, it's row 3, column 6.\n\nI think there's confusion in row and column labels.\n\nTo clarify: if the board is shown with row 9 at the top and row 0 at the bottom, and columns 0 to 9 from left to right, then position (x,y) is column x, row y.\n\nSo, (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, it's represented as row number followed by the cells.\n\nSo, row 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nrow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\n...\n\nrow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nand columns 0 to 9.\n\nSo, position (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, it shows 'A' at row 3, column 6, which is position (6,3).\n\nWait, no, position (x,y): x is column, y is row.\n\nSo, (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, row 3, column 6 has an 'A', which is apple at (6,3).\n\nWait, this is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the coordinates are defined as (y,x) instead of (x,y).\n\nWait, in programming, coordinates are often (row, column), which is (y,x).\n\nLooking back, in the problem statement, it says: \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n\nSo, (x,y), with x increasing to the right, y increasing upwards.\n\nTherefore, position (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, row 3, column 6 has an 'A', which would be position (6,3).\n\nThis suggests a mismatch.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the board.\n\nLet me re-examine the board:\n\n 9 . . . . . . . A . .\n\n 8 . . . . . . . A . .\n\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 6 . . . 2 . . . . 1 .\n\n 5 . . . T . . . . . .\n\n 4 . . . . . . . ."

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to make my next move. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board setup. The board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,7). There are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2). There's also an enemy snake at (8,7), with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nLet me try to visualize this board. From the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . 2 . . . . 1 .\n\nRow 6: . . . T . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: .

The enemy snake is at (8,7), which is column 8, row 7.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, so I should consider which one is closest and safest to reach.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: |9-3| = 6\n\n- Delta Y: |0-7| = 7\n\n- Total moves: 13\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |9-7| = 2\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: |6-3| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |3-7| = 4\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\n4. (7,8):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |8-7| = 1\n\n- Total moves: 5\n\n5. (1,2):\n\n- Delta X: |1-3| = 2\n\n- Delta Y: |2-7| = 5\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,8) with 5 moves, followed by (7,9) at 6 moves, and the others at 7 moves.\n\nNow, I need to think about the path to each apple and consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (7,8):\n\n- From (3,7), I need to move right to (7,7), then up to (7,8).\n\n- But the enemy snake is at (8,7), which is to the right of my target position.\n\n- I need to make sure the enemy doesn't block my path or intercept me.\n\n- The enemy is only one position away from my path, at (8,7).\n\n- If the enemy moves left, it could potentially block my path.\n\n- However, I can reach (7,7) before the enemy can reach it from (8,7), assuming it takes one move.\n\n- So, it might be safe to go for (7,8).\n\nNext, the apple at (7,9):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (7,7), then up to (7,9).\n\n- That's a total of 4 right moves and 2 up moves, totaling 6 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is adjacent to my path.\n\n- Similar to the previous apple, the enemy could potentially block my path, but I should reach (7,7) first.\n\n- Perhaps still manageable.\n\nThe apple at (6,3):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (6,7), then down to (6,3).\n\n- That's 3 right moves and 4 down moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is below and to the right.\n\n- Less likely to interfere with this path.\n\n- However, moving down exposes me to the enemy if it moves down as well.\n\nThe apple at (1,2):\n\n- From (3,7), move left to (1,7), then down to (1,2).\n\n- That's 2 left moves and 5 down moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is to the right.\n\n- Moving left seems safer, as the enemy is to the right.\n\n- But I need to ensure that there are no other obstacles or that the enemy doesn't move towards me.\n\nThe apple at (9,0):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (9,7), then down to (9,0).\n\n- That's 6 right moves and 7 down moves, totaling 13 moves.\n\n- That's a long path, and the enemy could potentially intercept me.\n\nGiven these options, the apple at (7,8) seems the closest, requiring only 5 moves. Although the enemy is nearby, I believe I can reach it before the enemy can block my path.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves to get to (7,8):\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move right to (7,7)\n\n5. Move up to (7,8)\n\nEach move takes one turn, so in 5 moves, I can reach (7,8).\n\nNow, considering the enemy is at (8,7). If it moves left, it could reach (7,7) in one move, which would be concurrent with my arrival at (7,7). But since I need to move to (7,8) from (7,7), and the enemy is at (7,7), I need to make sure I can move to (7,8) without collision.\n\nIn Snake games, if two snakes occupy the same space, the longer snake survives, or both die, depending on the rules. But in this case, since we're both head-to-head, and assuming standard Snake rules, if we both move into the same space, we both die.\n\nTherefore, I need to avoid such a collision.\n\nTo prevent this, I can try to reach (7,8) before the enemy can reach (7,7). But since we both can move there in one move, it's a race.\n\nPerhaps I should consider another path or another apple to avoid this risk.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to trick the enemy into moving away by feinting a different direction.\n\nBut since I don't have control over the enemy's movements, I need to plan based on possible scenarios.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (7,9) instead.\n\nPath to (7,9):\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move right to (7,7)\n\n5. Move up to (7,8)\n\n6. Move up to (7,9)\n\nThat's 6 moves, which is more than the 5 moves to (7,8), but it might be safer because it's higher up, away from the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,7), so if I go to (7,9), the enemy would have to move up twice to reach (8,9), which is not directly in my path.\n\nTherefore, going for (7,9) might be a safer option.\n\nAlternatively, consider the apple at (6,3), which is at (6,3):\n\nPath:\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move down to (6,6)\n\n5. Move down to (6,5)\n\n6. Move down to (6,4)\n\n7. Move down to (6,3)\n\nThat's 7 moves, which is longer, but the enemy is at (8,7), which is below me, so moving down might expose me to the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (8,7), which is below me at (3,7). So moving down brings me closer to the enemy.\n\nThat might not be a good idea.\n\nNow, consider the apple at (1,2):\n\nPath:\n\n1. Move left to (2,7)\n\n2. Move left to (1,7)\n\n3. Move down to (1,6)\n\n4. Move down to (1,5)\n\n5. Move down to (1,4)\n\n6. Move down to (1,3)\n\n7. Move down to (1,2)\n\nThat's 7 moves as well.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,7), which is to the right and below me.\n\nMoving left away from the enemy seems safer.\n\nBut I need to ensure"

(1,2):\n\n- Delta X: |1-3| = 2\n\n- Delta Y: |2-7| = 5\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,8) with 5 moves, followed by (7,9) at 6 moves, and the others at 7 moves.\n\nNow, I need to think about the path to each apple and consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (7,8):\n\n- From (3,7), I need to move right to (7,7), then up to (7,8).\n\n- But the enemy snake is at (8,7), which is to the right of my target position.\n\n- I need to make sure the enemy doesn't block my path or intercept me.\n\n- The enemy is only one position away from my path, at (8,7).\n\n- If the enemy moves left, it could potentially block my path.\n\n- However, I can reach (7,7) before the enemy can reach it from (8,7), assuming it takes one move.\n\n- So, it might be safe to go for (7,8).\n\nNext, the apple at (7,9):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (7,7), then up to (7,9).\n\n- That's a total of 4 right moves and 2 up moves, totaling 6 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is adjacent to my path.\n\n- Similar to the previous apple, the enemy could potentially block my path, but I should reach (7,7) first.\n\n- Perhaps still manageable.\n\nThe apple at (6,3):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (6,7), then down to (6,3).\n\n- That's 3 right moves and 4 down moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is below and to the right.\n\n- Less likely to interfere with this path.\n\n- However, moving down exposes me to the enemy if it moves down as well.\n\nThe apple at (1,2):\n\n- From (3,7), move left to (1,7), then down to (1,2).\n\n- That's 2 left moves and 5 down moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is to the right.\n\n- Moving left seems safer, as the enemy is to the right.\n\n- But I need to ensure that there are no other obstacles or that the enemy doesn't move towards me.\n\nThe apple at (9,0):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (9,7), then down to (9,0).\n\n- That's 6 right moves and 7 down moves, totaling 13 moves.\n\n- That's a long path, and the enemy could potentially intercept me.\n\nGiven these options, the apple at (7,8) seems the closest, requiring only 5 moves. Although the enemy is nearby, I believe I can reach it before the enemy can block my path.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves to get to (7,8):\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move right to (7,7)\n\n5. Move up to (7,8)\n\nEach move takes one turn, so in 5 moves, I can reach (7,8).\n\nNow, considering the enemy is at (8,7). If it moves left, it could reach (7,7) in one move, which would be concurrent with my arrival at (7,7). But since I need to move to (7,8) from (7,7), and the enemy is at (7,7), I need to make sure I can move to (7,8) without collision.\n\nIn Snake games, if two snakes occupy the same space, the longer snake survives, or both die, depending on the rules. But in this case, since we're both head-to-head, and assuming standard Snake rules, if we both move into the same space, we both die.\n\nTherefore, I need to avoid such a collision.\n\nTo prevent this, I can try to reach (7,8) before the enemy can reach (7,7). But since we both can move there in one move, it's a race.\n\nPerhaps I should consider another path or another apple to avoid this risk.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to trick the enemy into moving away by feinting a different direction.\n\nBut since I don't have control over the enemy's movements, I need to plan based on possible scenarios.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (7,9) instead.\n\nPath to (7,9):\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move right to (7,7)\n\n5. Move up to (7,8)\n\n6. Move up to (7,9)\n\nThat's 6 moves, which is more than the 5 moves to (7,8), but it might be safer because it's higher up, away from the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,7), so if I go to (7,9), the enemy would have to move up twice to reach (8,9), which is not directly in my path.\n\nTherefore, going for (7,9) might be a safer option.\n\nAlternatively, consider the apple at (6,3), which is at (6,3):\n\nPath:\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move down to (6,6)\n\n5. Move down to (6,5)\n\n6. Move down to (6,4)\n\n7. Move down to (6,3)\n\nThat's 7 moves, which is longer, but the enemy is at (8,7), which is below me, so moving down might expose me to the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (8,7), which is below me at (3,7). So moving down brings me closer to the enemy.\n\nThat might not be a good idea.\n\nNow, consider the apple at (1,2):\n\nPath:\n\n1. Move left to (2,7)\n\n2. Move left to (1,7)\n\n3. Move down to (1,6)\n\n4. Move down to (1,5)\n\n5. Move down to (1,4)\n\n6. Move down to (1,3)\n\n7. Move down to (1,2)\n\nThat's 7 moves as well.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,7), which is to the right and below me.\n\nMoving left away from the enemy seems safer.\n\nBut I need to ensure"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to make my next move. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board setup. The board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (1,7). Wait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (3,7), but in the initial information, it says I'm at (1,7). Maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check the board state.\n\nFrom the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . 1 . .\n\nRow 7: . . . 2 . . . . T . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (1,7), which is column 1, row 7. The enemy snake is at (7,7), which is column 7, row 7, and its body is at (7,6).\n\nWait, in the board state, '1' is at (7,7), and 'T' is at (7,6), assuming 'T' is the tail of the enemy snake.\n\nThere are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (1,2), and (4,2).\n\nWait, in the initial information, it says apples are at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (1,2), and (4,2), but looking at the board state, apples are shown at (7,9), (6,3), (1,2), and (0,9). Wait, (0,9) is the bottom right corner, but according to the coordinates, (0,0) is bottom left, so (0,9) is top left.\n\nWait, in row 9, column 7 is 'A', which is (7,9), row 3, column 6 is 'A', which is (6,3), row 2, column 1 is 'A', which is (1,2), and row 0, column 9 is 'A', which is (9,0). So that matches.\n\nAlso, there's an 'A' at (4,2), which might be another apple.\n\nSo, my position is (1,7), enemy snake is at (7,7) and (7,6).\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, so I should consider which one is closest and safest to reach.\n\nLet me calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: |9-1| = 8\n\n- Delta Y: |0-7| = 7\n\n- Total moves: 15\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: |7-1| = 6\n\n- Delta Y: |9-7| = 2\n\n- Total moves: 8\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: |6-1| = 5\n\n- Delta Y: |3-7| = 4\n\n- Total moves: 9\n\n4. (1,2):\n\n- Delta X: |1-1| = 0\n\n- Delta Y: |2-7| = 5\n\n- Total moves: 5\n\n5. (4,2):\n\n- Delta X: |4-1| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |2-7| = 5\n\n- Total moves: 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,2) with 5 moves, followed by (7,9) and (4,2) at 8 moves, and (6,3) at 9 moves, and (9,0) at 15 moves.\n\nNow, I need to think about the path to each apple and consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (1,2):\n\n- From (1,7), I need to move down to (1,2).\n\n- That's 5 moves down.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,7), which is to the right and at the same row.\n\n- The enemy would have to move left to intercept me, but it's several columns away.\n\n- It would take the enemy at least 6 moves to reach (1,7), assuming it moves left each time.\n\n- Since I can reach (1,2) in 5 moves, I should be able to get the apple before the enemy can reach me.\n\n- Also, moving down doesn't put me in the enemy's way.\n\n- This seems like a safe option.\n\nNext, the apple at (7,9):\n\n- From (1,7), move right to (7,7), then up to (7,9).\n\n- That's 6 right moves and 2 up moves, totaling 8 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,7), so it's right in my path.\n\n- If I move right to (2,7), the enemy could move to (7,7), but I still need to cover 5 more right moves to reach (7,7), and then 2 up moves.\n\n- The enemy might try to block my path, but I think I can reach (7,9) before the enemy can surround me.\n\n- However, this seems riskier compared to going for (1,2).\n\nThe apple at (4,2):\n\n- From (1,7), move right to (4,7), then down to (4,2).\n\n- That's 3 right moves and 5 down moves, totaling 8 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,7), which is to the right.\n\n- Moving right towards (4,7) might bring me closer to the enemy, but I can still move down after that.\n\n- It might be safer than going all the way right to (7,9), but still riskier than going down to (1,2).\n\nThe apple at (6,3):\n\n- From (1,7), move right to (6,7), then down to (6,3).\n\n- That's 5 right moves and 4 down moves, totaling 9 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,7), which is close to my path.\n\n- This seems longer and potentially riskier.\n\nThe apple at (9,0):\n\n- From (1,7), move right to (9,7), then down to (9,0).\n\n- That's 8 right moves and 7 down moves, totaling 15 moves.\n\n- That's a long path, and the enemy could easily intercept me.\n\nGiven these options, the apple at (1,2) seems the closest and safest to reach. I can get there in 5 moves without crossing paths with the enemy, who would take at least 6 moves to reach my current position.\n\nTherefore, I should go for the apple at (1,2).\n\nNow, to get there, I need to move down 5 times.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles or other snakes in my way.\n\nLooking at the board state, from row 7 down to row 2, column 1 is empty.\n\nSo, I can safely move down to (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and finally (1,2).\n\nNo issues there.\n\nAlso, the enemy is at (7,7), which is in a different column, so it shouldn't interfere with my path.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be down.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that moving down doesn't put me in a position where the enemy can cut me off.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible moves.\n\nIf the enemy moves left towards me, but it's at (7,7), and I'm at (1,7). The enemy would need to move left 6 times to reach (1,7), which would take 6 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, I can reach (1,2) in 5 moves.\n\nSo, even if the enemy moves left each time, it won't reach me before I get the apple.\n\nTherefore, moving down is safe.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (1,2), I will grow longer, which might give me an advantage in case the enemy tries to block me.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting this apple seems like the best strategy.\n\nSo, my next move should be down.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{DOWN}} \\]"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,5). There are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (3,6), and (7,8). Oh, and there's an enemy snake at (9,6), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . A . . . . . 1\n\nRow 5: . . . 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,0): Row 9, Column 0\n\n- (7,9): Row 7, Column 9\n\n- (6,3): Row 6, Column 3\n\n- (3,6): Row 3, Column 6\n\n- (7,8): Row 7, Column 8\n\nAnd my snake is at (3,5): Row 3, Column 5\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,6): Row 9, Column 6, with no body parts.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about which apple to go for. I should consider which one is closest and which path is safest, avoiding the walls, myself, and the enemy snake.\n\nLet's look at the distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 0 - 5 = -5 (down)\n\n- Total moves: 6 + 5 = 11 moves\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: 7 - 3 = 4 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 9 - 5 = 4 (up)\n\n- Total moves: 4 + 4 = 8 moves\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: 6 - 3 = 3 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 3 - 5 = -2 (down)\n\n- Total moves: 3 + 2 = 5 moves\n\n4. (3,6):\n\n- Delta X: 3 - 3 = 0\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 5 = 1 (up)\n\n- Total moves: 0 + 1 = 1 move\n\n5. (7,8):\n\n- Delta X: 7 - 3 = 4 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 8 - 5 = 3 (up)\n\n- Total moves: 4 + 3 = 7 moves\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,6), which is just one move up from my current position. That seems promising.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Let's see:\n\nI'm at (3,5). Moving up to (3,6). Looking at the board, row 3, column 6 is an apple, which is fine\u2014I can eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I need to plan my next moves. Since I've grown, I need to make sure that my tail doesn't block my path.\n\nWait, but in this game, does the snake grow immediately after eating the apple, or does it take a turn to grow?\n\nI think in standard snake games, the growth happens immediately after eating the apple, so my tail would extend by one block.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm at (3,5), and I move to (3,6), and eat the apple, my tail would stay at (3,5), and I would have a new head at (3,6).\n\nBut I need to confirm if the growth happens immediately or after the next move.\n\nLet's assume that growth happens immediately after eating the apple, so my tail remains in place, and my body extends by one block.\n\nBut in reality, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail stays where it is, and you don't lose the last segment; instead, you gain a new segment, effectively growing longer.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail doesn't move forward immediately; it stays put until the rest of the snake has moved past it.\n\nHmm, this could be a bit confusing.\n\nLet me think differently. For now, let's assume that after eating an apple, my snake grows, and I have to make sure that I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut in this immediate move, since I'm just moving to (3,6), and assuming that growth happens after this move, I should be safe.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,6), and it has no body parts. So, it's just the head at (9,6).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't collide with it or with any part of its body. But since it has no body parts listed, maybe it's small.\n\nBut in snake games, usually, snakes have a body of at least one segment, which is the head.\n\nSo, I need to avoid its head at (9,6).\n\nBut in this turn, I'm at (3,5), and moving to (3,6), which is far from the enemy at (9,6). So, no issue there.\n\nBut I need to think about future moves and how the enemy might move.\n\nWait, but for now, I'm just deciding my next move.\n\nMaybe I should prioritize eating the closest apple, which is at (3,6).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for a different apple that might be less contested or have a clearer path.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (3,6) is right next to me, and there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLet me consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,6). It could move up, down, left, or right, but I don't know its strategy.\n\nIf I eat the apple at (3,6), I grow, and then I need to plan my path to the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for a different apple that might be easier to reach without crossing paths with the enemy.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6,3), which is at row 6, column 3.\n\nFrom my current position at (3,5), moving to (6,3) would require moving down two rows (since delta Y is 6 - 5 = 1, but I need to go to Y=3 from Y=5, which is down 2 rows) and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, no. My Y coordinates increase upwards, so from Y=5 to Y=3, that's down by 2 rows.\n\nAnd from X=3 to X=6, that's right by 3 columns.\n\nSo, move down 2, right 3.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,3), that's down 2 rows.\n\nThen from (3,3) to (6,3), that's right 3 columns.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in between.\n\nAlso, considering that I need to make multiple moves, and the enemy might be moving as well.\n\nThis seems complicated for just one move decision.\n\nMaybe I should stick with the closest apple, which is at (3,6), just one move up from my current position.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can reassess the situation.\n\nAdditionally, since the enemy is at (9,6), which is far away from my current position, and assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe for now.\n\nBut I need to think about the long term. If I eat the apple at (3,6), I grow, and then I need to navigate to another apple without hitting anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (7,8), which is at row 7, column 8.\n\nFrom (3,5), that's down 2 rows and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, no. From (3,5) to (7,8) is up 4 rows and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, Y increases upwards, so from Y=5 to Y=8 is up 3 rows.\n\nWait, Y=5 to Y=8 is up 3 rows (since 8-5=3).\n\nAnd X from 3 to 7 is right 4 columns.\n\nSo, total moves: 3 up and 4 right, totaling 7 moves.\n\nThat seems farther than the apple at (3,6), which is just 1 move up.\n\nAlso, moving to (3,6) doesn't require navigating around any obstacles, as far as I"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,6). There are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2). There's also an enemy snake at (8,6) with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . 2 . . . . 1 .\n\nRow 5: . . . T . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (7,9)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (1,2)\n\nMy snake is at (3,6), which is row 3, column 6.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,6), which is row 8, column 6.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. I should consider the closest apple and the path to it, making sure it's safe and doesn't lead me into the enemy or a wall.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (3,6):\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: |9-3| = 6\n\n- Delta Y: |0-6| = 6\n\n- Total moves: 12\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |9-6| = 3\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: |6-3| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |3-6| = 3\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\n4. (7,8):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |8-6| = 2\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\n5. (1,2):\n\n- Delta X: |1-3| = 2\n\n- Delta Y: |2-6| = 4\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2), all with 6 moves.\n\nNow, I need to consider the paths to these apples and see which one is the safest.\n\nLet's look at each path:\n\n1. To (6,3):\n\n- From (3,6), go down to (6,6), then left to (6,3).\n\n- But looking at the board, there's an apple at (6,3), and an enemy snake at (8,6).\n\n- I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,6), which is below me at (3,6). So, going down to (6,6) might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\n- I need to see if the enemy is moving. But since I don't know its direction, I should assume it could move towards me.\n\n- Maybe it's better to avoid going down.\n\n2. To (7,8):\n\n- From (3,6), go right to (7,6), then up to (7,8).\n\n- Looking at the board, there's an apple at (7,9), but not directly in my path.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,6), which is to the right and down from my position.\n\n- If I go right to (7,6), I'm getting closer to the enemy.\n\n- Again, potential conflict with the enemy.\n\n3. To (1,2):\n\n- From (3,6), go left to (1,6), then down to (1,2).\n\n- The enemy is at (8,6), which is to the right, so moving left away from it seems safer.\n\n- Looking at the board, there's an apple at (1,2), and no immediate obstacles.\n\n- This seems like a safer path.\n\nAlso, considering that after eating an apple, I grow, so I need to make sure that my path after eating is clear.\n\nLet me think about growing.\n\nWhen I eat an apple, my snake grows by one segment. So, my tail will stay where it was until the rest of my body moves.\n\nI need to make sure that after eating, I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for the immediate move, I just need to ensure that the next move is safe.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (1,2) is the best option, as it's away from the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (3,6), which is right at my current position. Wait, no, that's where I am now.\n\nWait, no, the apples are at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2). I'm at (3,6), which is not an apple position.\n\nWait, in the board, there's an 'A' at (3,6), but in the list, it's (6,3). Maybe a typo.\n\nWait, the board shows:\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nColumn 6, row 3 is apple, which is (6,3).\n\nI'm at (3,6), which is column 3, row 6.\n\nWait, I think there's a confusion in coordinates.\n\nWait, in the board, rows are from 9 to 0, with 9 at the top.\n\nColumns are 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nSo, position (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the apple positions, (6,3) is column 6, row 3.\n\nI need to be careful with coordinates.\n\nWait, perhaps the board is represented with rows from top to bottom, with row 9 at the top.\n\nSo, position (x,y), with x increasing to the right, y increasing upwards.\n\nSo, (3,6) is column 3, row 6 (from the bottom).\n\nBut in the board grid, row 9 is at the top, row 0 at the bottom.\n\nSo, y increases upwards.\n\nTherefore, my position is row 6, column 3.\n\nBut in the board grid, it's row 6, column 3.\n\nWait, but in the board description, it's row 3, column 6.\n\nI think there's confusion in row and column labels.\n\nTo clarify: if the board is shown with row 9 at the top and row 0 at the bottom, and columns 0 to 9 from left to right, then position (x,y) is column x, row y.\n\nSo, (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, it's represented as row number followed by the cells.\n\nSo, row 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nrow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\n...\n\nrow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nand columns 0 to 9.\n\nSo, position (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, it shows 'A' at row 3, column 6, which is position (6,3).\n\nWait, no, position (x,y): x is column, y is row.\n\nSo, (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, row 3, column 6 has an 'A', which is apple at (6,3).\n\nWait, this is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the coordinates are defined as (y,x) instead of (x,y).\n\nWait, in programming, coordinates are often (row, column), which is (y,x).\n\nLooking back, in the problem statement, it says: \"Normal X,Y coordinates are used. Coordinates range from (0,0) at bottom left to (9,9) at top right.\"\n\nSo, (x,y), with x increasing to the right, y increasing upwards.\n\nTherefore, position (3,6) is column 3, row 6.\n\nBut in the board grid, row 3, column 6 has an 'A', which would be position (6,3).\n\nThis suggests a mismatch.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the board.\n\nLet me re-examine the board:\n\n 9 . . . . . . . A . .\n\n 8 . . . . . . . A . .\n\n 7 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n 6 . . . 2 . . . . 1 .\n\n 5 . . . T . . . . . .\n\n 4 . . . . . . . ."

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to make my next move. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board setup. The board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,7). There are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2). There's also an enemy snake at (8,7), with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nLet me try to visualize this board. From the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . 2 . . . . 1 .\n\nRow 6: . . . T . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: .

The enemy snake is at (8,7), which is column 8, row 7.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, so I should consider which one is closest and safest to reach.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: |9-3| = 6\n\n- Delta Y: |0-7| = 7\n\n- Total moves: 13\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |9-7| = 2\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: |6-3| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |3-7| = 4\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\n4. (7,8):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |8-7| = 1\n\n- Total moves: 5\n\n5. (1,2):\n\n- Delta X: |1-3| = 2\n\n- Delta Y: |2-7| = 5\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,8) with 5 moves, followed by (7,9) at 6 moves, and the others at 7 moves.\n\nNow, I need to think about the path to each apple and consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (7,8):\n\n- From (3,7), I need to move right to (7,7), then up to (7,8).\n\n- But the enemy snake is at (8,7), which is to the right of my target position.\n\n- I need to make sure the enemy doesn't block my path or intercept me.\n\n- The enemy is only one position away from my path, at (8,7).\n\n- If the enemy moves left, it could potentially block my path.\n\n- However, I can reach (7,7) before the enemy can reach it from (8,7), assuming it takes one move.\n\n- So, it might be safe to go for (7,8).\n\nNext, the apple at (7,9):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (7,7), then up to (7,9).\n\n- That's a total of 4 right moves and 2 up moves, totaling 6 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is adjacent to my path.\n\n- Similar to the previous apple, the enemy could potentially block my path, but I should reach (7,7) first.\n\n- Perhaps still manageable.\n\nThe apple at (6,3):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (6,7), then down to (6,3).\n\n- That's 3 right moves and 4 down moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is below and to the right.\n\n- Less likely to interfere with this path.\n\n- However, moving down exposes me to the enemy if it moves down as well.\n\nThe apple at (1,2):\n\n- From (3,7), move left to (1,7), then down to (1,2).\n\n- That's 2 left moves and 5 down moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is to the right.\n\n- Moving left seems safer, as the enemy is to the right.\n\n- But I need to ensure that there are no other obstacles or that the enemy doesn't move towards me.\n\nThe apple at (9,0):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (9,7), then down to (9,0).\n\n- That's 6 right moves and 7 down moves, totaling 13 moves.\n\n- That's a long path, and the enemy could potentially intercept me.\n\nGiven these options, the apple at (7,8) seems the closest, requiring only 5 moves. Although the enemy is nearby, I believe I can reach it before the enemy can block my path.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves to get to (7,8):\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move right to (7,7)\n\n5. Move up to (7,8)\n\nEach move takes one turn, so in 5 moves, I can reach (7,8).\n\nNow, considering the enemy is at (8,7). If it moves left, it could reach (7,7) in one move, which would be concurrent with my arrival at (7,7). But since I need to move to (7,8) from (7,7), and the enemy is at (7,7), I need to make sure I can move to (7,8) without collision.\n\nIn Snake games, if two snakes occupy the same space, the longer snake survives, or both die, depending on the rules. But in this case, since we're both head-to-head, and assuming standard Snake rules, if we both move into the same space, we both die.\n\nTherefore, I need to avoid such a collision.\n\nTo prevent this, I can try to reach (7,8) before the enemy can reach (7,7). But since we both can move there in one move, it's a race.\n\nPerhaps I should consider another path or another apple to avoid this risk.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to trick the enemy into moving away by feinting a different direction.\n\nBut since I don't have control over the enemy's movements, I need to plan based on possible scenarios.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (7,9) instead.\n\nPath to (7,9):\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move right to (7,7)\n\n5. Move up to (7,8)\n\n6. Move up to (7,9)\n\nThat's 6 moves, which is more than the 5 moves to (7,8), but it might be safer because it's higher up, away from the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,7), so if I go to (7,9), the enemy would have to move up twice to reach (8,9), which is not directly in my path.\n\nTherefore, going for (7,9) might be a safer option.\n\nAlternatively, consider the apple at (6,3), which is at (6,3):\n\nPath:\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move down to (6,6)\n\n5. Move down to (6,5)\n\n6. Move down to (6,4)\n\n7. Move down to (6,3)\n\nThat's 7 moves, which is longer, but the enemy is at (8,7), which is below me, so moving down might expose me to the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (8,7), which is below me at (3,7). So moving down brings me closer to the enemy.\n\nThat might not be a good idea.\n\nNow, consider the apple at (1,2):\n\nPath:\n\n1. Move left to (2,7)\n\n2. Move left to (1,7)\n\n3. Move down to (1,6)\n\n4. Move down to (1,5)\n\n5. Move down to (1,4)\n\n6. Move down to (1,3)\n\n7. Move down to (1,2)\n\nThat's 7 moves as well.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,7), which is to the right and below me.\n\nMoving left away from the enemy seems safer.\n\nBut I need to ensure"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to make my next move. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board setup. The board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,7). There are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2). There's also an enemy snake at (8,7), with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nLet me try to visualize this board. From the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . 2 . . . . 1 .\n\nRow 6: . . . T . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (3,7), which is column 3, row 7. The enemy snake is at (8,7), which is column 8, row 7.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, so I should consider which one is closest and safest to reach.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: |9-3| = 6\n\n- Delta Y: |0-7| = 7\n\n- Total moves: 13\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |9-7| = 2\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: |6-3| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |3-7| = 4\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\n4. (7,8):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |8-7| = 1\n\n- Total moves: 5\n\n5. (1,2):\n\n- Delta X: |1-3| = 2\n\n- Delta Y: |2-7| = 5\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,8) with 5 moves, followed by (7,9) at 6 moves, and the others at 7 moves.\n\nNow, I need to think about the path to each apple and consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (7,8):\n\n- From (3,7), I need to move right to (7,7), then up to (7,8).\n\n- But the enemy snake is at (8,7), which is to the right of my target position.\n\n- I need to make sure the enemy doesn't block my path or intercept me.\n\n- The enemy is only one position away from my path, at (8,7).\n\n- If the enemy moves left, it could potentially block my path.\n\n- However, I can reach (7,7) before the enemy can reach it from (8,7), assuming it takes one move.\n\n- So, it might be safe to go for (7,8).\n\nNext, the apple at (7,9):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (7,7), then up to (7,9).\n\n- That's a total of 4 right moves and 2 up moves, totaling 6 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is adjacent to my path.\n\n- Similar to the previous apple, the enemy could potentially block my path, but I should reach (7,7) first.\n\n- Perhaps still manageable.\n\nThe apple at (6,3):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (6,7), then down to (6,3).\n\n- That's 3 right moves and 4 down moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is below and to the right.\n\n- Less likely to interfere with this path.\n\n- However, moving down exposes me to the enemy if it moves down as well.\n\nThe apple at (1,2):\n\n- From (3,7), move left to (1,7), then down to (1,2).\n\n- That's 2 left moves and 5 down moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is to the right.\n\n- Moving left seems safer, as the enemy is to the right.\n\n- But I need to ensure that there are no other obstacles or that the enemy doesn't move towards me.\n\nThe apple at (9,0):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (9,7), then down to (9,0).\n\n- That's 6 right moves and 7 down moves, totaling 13 moves.\n\n- That's a long path, and the enemy could potentially intercept me.\n\nGiven these options, the apple at (7,8) seems the closest, requiring only 5 moves. Although the enemy is nearby, I believe I can reach it before the enemy can block my path.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves to get to (7,8):\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move right to (7,7)\n\n5. Move up to (7,8)\n\nEach move takes one turn, so in 5 moves, I can reach (7,8).\n\nNow, considering the enemy is at (8,7). If it moves left, it could reach (7,7) in one move, which would be concurrent with my arrival at (7,7). But since I need to move to (7,8) from (7,7), and the enemy is at (7,7), I need to make sure I can move to (7,8) without collision.\n\nIn Snake games, if two snakes occupy the same space, the longer snake survives, or both die, depending on the rules. But in this case, since we're both head-to-head, and assuming standard Snake rules, if we both move into the same space, we both die.\n\nTherefore, I need to avoid such a collision.\n\nTo prevent this, I can try to reach (7,8) before the enemy can reach (7,7). But since we both can move there in one move, it's a race.\n\nPerhaps I should consider another path or another apple to avoid this risk.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to trick the enemy into moving away by feinting a different direction.\n\nBut since I don't have control over the enemy's movements, I need to plan based on possible scenarios.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (7,9) instead.\n\nPath to (7,9):\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move right to (7,7)\n\n5. Move up to (7,8)\n\n6. Move up to (7,9)\n\nThat's 6 moves, which is more than the 5 moves to (7,8), but it might be safer because it's higher up, away from the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,7), so if I go to (7,9), the enemy would have to move up twice to reach (8,9), which is not directly in my path.\n\nTherefore, going for (7,9) might be a safer option.\n\nAlternatively, consider the apple at (6,3), which is at (6,3):\n\nPath:\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move down to (6,6)\n\n5. Move down to (6,5)\n\n6. Move down to (6,4)\n\n7. Move down to (6,3)\n\nThat's 7 moves, which is longer, but the enemy is at (8,7), which is below me, so moving down might expose me to the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (8,7), which is below me at (3,7). So moving down brings me closer to the enemy.\n\nThat might not be a good idea.\n\nNow, consider the apple at (1,2):\n\nPath:\n\n1. Move left to (2,7)\n\n2. Move left to (1,7)\n\n3. Move down to (1,6)\n\n4. Move down to (1,5)\n\n5. Move down to (1,4)\n\n6. Move down to (1,3)\n\n7. Move down to (1,2)\n\nThat's 7 moves as well.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,7), which is to the right and below me.\n\nMoving left away from the enemy seems safer.\n\nBut I need to ensure"

The board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (1,7). Wait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (3,7), but in the initial information, it says I'm at (1,7). Maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check the board state.\n\nFrom the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . 1 . .\n\nRow 7: . . . 2 . . . . T . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: .

The enemy snake is at (7,7), which is column 7, row 7, and its body is at (7,6).\n\nWait, in the board state, '1' is at (7,7), and 'T' is at (7,6), assuming 'T' is the tail of the enemy snake.\n\nThere are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (1,2), and (4,2).\n\nWait, in the initial information, it says apples are at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (1,2), and (4,2), but looking at the board state, apples are shown at (7,9), (6,3), (1,2), and (0,9). Wait, (0,9) is the bottom right corner, but according to the coordinates, (0,0) is bottom left, so (0,9) is top left.\n\nWait, in row 9, column 7 is 'A', which is (7,9), row 3, column 6 is 'A', which is (6,3), row 2, column 1 is 'A', which is (1,2), and row 0, column 9 is 'A', which is (9,0). So that matches.\n\nAlso, there's an 'A' at (4,2), which might be another apple.\n\nSo, my position is (1,7), enemy snake is at (7,7) and (7,6).\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, so I should consider which one is closest and safest to reach.\n\nLet me calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: |9-1| = 8\n\n- Delta Y: |0-7| = 7\n\n- Total moves: 15\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: |7-1| = 6\n\n- Delta Y: |9-7| = 2\n\n- Total moves: 8\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: |6-1| = 5\n\n- Delta Y: |3-7| = 4\n\n- Total moves: 9\n\n4. (1,2):\n\n- Delta X: |1-1| = 0\n\n- Delta Y: |2-7| = 5\n\n- Total moves: 5\n\n5. (4,2):\n\n- Delta X: |4-1| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |2-7| = 5\n\n- Total moves: 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,2) with 5 moves, followed by (7,9) and (4,2) at 8 moves, and (6,3) at 9 moves, and (9,0) at 15 moves.\n\nNow, I need to think about the path to each apple and consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (1,2):\n\n- From (1,7), I need to move down to (1,2).\n\n- That's 5 moves down.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,7), which is to the right and at the same row.\n\n- The enemy would have to move left to intercept me, but it's several columns away.\n\n- It would take the enemy at least 6 moves to reach (1,7), assuming it moves left each time.\n\n- Since I can reach (1,2) in 5 moves, I should be able to get the apple before the enemy can reach me.\n\n- Also, moving down doesn't put me in the enemy's way.\n\n- This seems like a safe option.\n\nNext, the apple at (7,9):\n\n- From (1,7), move right to (7,7), then up to (7,9).\n\n- That's 6 right moves and 2 up moves, totaling 8 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,7), so it's right in my path.\n\n- If I move right to (2,7), the enemy could move to (7,7), but I still need to cover 5 more right moves to reach (7,7), and then 2 up moves.\n\n- The enemy might try to block my path, but I think I can reach (7,9) before the enemy can surround me.\n\n- However, this seems riskier compared to going for (1,2).\n\nThe apple at (4,2):\n\n- From (1,7), move right to (4,7), then down to (4,2).\n\n- That's 3 right moves and 5 down moves, totaling 8 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,7), which is to the right.\n\n- Moving right towards (4,7) might bring me closer to the enemy, but I can still move down after that.\n\n- It might be safer than going all the way right to (7,9), but still riskier than going down to (1,2).\n\nThe apple at (6,3):\n\n- From (1,7), move right to (6,7), then down to (6,3).\n\n- That's 5 right moves and 4 down moves, totaling 9 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,7), which is close to my path.\n\n- This seems longer and potentially riskier.\n\nThe apple at (9,0):\n\n- From (1,7), move right to (9,7), then down to (9,0).\n\n- That's 8 right moves and 7 down moves, totaling 15 moves.\n\n- That's a long path, and the enemy could easily intercept me.\n\nGiven these options, the apple at (1,2) seems the closest and safest to reach. I can get there in 5 moves without crossing paths with the enemy, who would take at least 6 moves to reach my current position.\n\nTherefore, I should go for the apple at (1,2).\n\nNow, to get there, I need to move down 5 times.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles or other snakes in my way.\n\nLooking at the board state, from row 7 down to row 2, column 1 is empty.\n\nSo, I can safely move down to (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and finally (1,2).\n\nNo issues there.\n\nAlso, the enemy is at (7,7), which is in a different column, so it shouldn't interfere with my path.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be down.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that moving down doesn't put me in a position where the enemy can cut me off.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible moves.\n\nIf the enemy moves left towards me, but it's at (7,7), and I'm at (1,7). The enemy would need to move left 6 times to reach (1,7), which would take 6 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, I can reach (1,2) in 5 moves.\n\nSo, even if the enemy moves left each time, it won't reach me before I get the apple.\n\nTherefore, moving down is safe.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (1,2), I will grow longer, which might give me an advantage in case the enemy tries to block me.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting this apple seems like the best strategy.\n\nSo, my next move should be down.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{DOWN}} \\]"

(4,2):\n\n- Delta X: |4-1| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |2-6| = 4\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,2) with 4 moves, followed by (6,3) at 8 moves, (4,2) at 7 moves, (7,9) at 9 moves, and (9,0) at 14 moves.\n\nNow, I need to think about the path to each apple and consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (1,2):\n\n- From (1,6), I need to move down to (1,2).\n\n- That's 4 moves down.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,8), which is to the right and above me.\n\n- The enemy would have to move left and down to intercept me, but it's several columns away.\n\n- It would take the enemy at least 7 moves to reach (1,6), assuming it moves left and down efficiently.\n\n- Since I can reach (1,2) in 4 moves, I should be able to get the apple before the enemy can reach me.\n\n- Also, moving down doesn't put me in the enemy's way.\n\n- This seems like a safe option.\n\nNext, the apple at (6,3):\n\n- From (1,6), move right to (6,6), then down to (6,3).\n\n- That's 5 right moves and 3 down moves, totaling 8 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,8), which is above and to the right.\n\n- Moving right towards (6,6) might bring me closer to the enemy, but I can still move down after that.\n\n- The enemy might try to block my path, but I think I can reach (6,3) before the enemy can surround me.\n\n- However, this seems riskier compared to going for (1,2).\n\nThe apple at (4,2):\n\n- From (1,6), move right to (4,6), then down to (4,2).\n\n- That's 3 right moves and 4 down moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,8), which is to the right and above.\n\n- Moving right towards (4,6) might bring me closer to the enemy, but I can still move down after that.\n\n- It might be safer than going all the way right to (7,9), but still riskier than going down to (1,2).\n\nThe apple at (7,9):\n\n- From (1,6), move right to (7,6), then up to (7,9).\n\n- That's 6 right moves and 3 up moves, totaling 9 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,8), which is close to my path.\n\n- If I move right to (2,6), the enemy could move down to intercept me.\n\n- This seems longer and potentially riskier.\n\nThe apple at (9,0):\n\n- From (1,6), move right to (9,6), then down to (9,0).\n\n- That's 8 right moves and 6 down moves, totaling 14 moves.\n\n- That's a long path, and the enemy could easily intercept me.\n\nGiven these options, the apple at (1,2) seems the closest and safest to reach. I can get there in 4 moves without crossing paths with the enemy, who would take at least 7 moves to reach my current position.\n\nTherefore, I should go for the apple at (1,2).\n\nNow, to get there, I need to move down 4 times.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles or other snakes in my way.\n\nLooking at the board state, from row 6 down to row 2, column 1 is empty.\n\nSo, I can safely move down to (1,5), then (1,4), (1,3), and finally (1,2).\n\nNo issues there.\n\nAlso, the enemy is at (7,8), which is in a different column, so it shouldn't interfere with my path.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be down.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that moving down doesn't put me in a position where the enemy can cut me off.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible moves.\n\nIf the enemy moves left towards me, but it's at (7,8), and I'm at (1,6). The enemy would need to move left 6 times to reach (1,8), but that's still above me.\n\nMeanwhile, I can reach (1,2) in 4 moves.\n\nThe enemy would have to strategically move down as well to intercept me, but it would take more moves for the enemy to reach me.\n\nSo, moving down seems safe.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (1,2), I will grow longer, which might give me an advantage in case the enemy tries to block me.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting this apple seems like the best strategy.\n\nSo, my next move should be down.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{DOWN}} \\]"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,5). There are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (3,6), and (7,8). Oh, and there's an enemy snake at (9,6), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head?\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me try to visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . A . . . . . 1\n\nRow 5: . . . 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,0): Row 9, Column 0\n\n- (7,9): Row 7, Column 9\n\n- (6,3): Row 6, Column 3\n\n- (3,6): Row 3, Column 6\n\n- (7,8): Row 7, Column 8\n\nAnd my snake is at (3,5): Row 3, Column 5\n\nEnemy snake is at (9,6): Row 9, Column 6, with no body parts.\n\nOkay, so I need to think about which apple to go for. I should consider which one is closest and which path is safest, avoiding the walls, myself, and the enemy snake.\n\nLet's look at the distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: 9 - 3 = 6 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 0 - 5 = -5 (down)\n\n- Total moves: 6 + 5 = 11 moves\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: 7 - 3 = 4 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 9 - 5 = 4 (up)\n\n- Total moves: 4 + 4 = 8 moves\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: 6 - 3 = 3 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 3 - 5 = -2 (down)\n\n- Total moves: 3 + 2 = 5 moves\n\n4. (3,6):\n\n- Delta X: 3 - 3 = 0\n\n- Delta Y: 6 - 5 = 1 (up)\n\n- Total moves: 0 + 1 = 1 move\n\n5. (7,8):\n\n- Delta X: 7 - 3 = 4 (right)\n\n- Delta Y: 8 - 5 = 3 (up)\n\n- Total moves: 4 + 3 = 7 moves\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,6), which is just one move up from my current position. That seems promising.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in the way. Let's see:\n\nI'm at (3,5). Moving up to (3,6). Looking at the board, row 3, column 6 is an apple, which is fine\u2014I can eat it and grow.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I need to plan my next moves. Since I've grown, I need to make sure that my tail doesn't block my path.\n\nWait, but in this game, does the snake grow immediately after eating the apple, or does it take a turn to grow?\n\nI think in standard snake games, the growth happens immediately after eating the apple, so my tail would extend by one block.\n\nBut in this case, since I'm at (3,5), and I move to (3,6), and eat the apple, my tail would stay at (3,5), and I would have a new head at (3,6).\n\nBut I need to confirm if the growth happens immediately or after the next move.\n\nLet's assume that growth happens immediately after eating the apple, so my tail remains in place, and my body extends by one block.\n\nBut in reality, in snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail stays where it is, and you don't lose the last segment; instead, you gain a new segment, effectively growing longer.\n\nWait, no. Actually, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail doesn't move forward immediately; it stays put until the rest of the snake has moved past it.\n\nHmm, this could be a bit confusing.\n\nLet me think differently. For now, let's assume that after eating an apple, my snake grows, and I have to make sure that I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut in this immediate move, since I'm just moving to (3,6), and assuming that growth happens after this move, I should be safe.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake. It's at (9,6), and it has no body parts. So, it's just the head at (9,6).\n\nI need to make sure that I don't collide with it or with any part of its body. But since it has no body parts listed, maybe it's small.\n\nBut in snake games, usually, snakes have a body of at least one segment, which is the head.\n\nSo, I need to avoid its head at (9,6).\n\nBut in this turn, I'm at (3,5), and moving to (3,6), which is far from the enemy at (9,6). So, no issue there.\n\nBut I need to think about future moves and how the enemy might move.\n\nWait, but for now, I'm just deciding my next move.\n\nMaybe I should prioritize eating the closest apple, which is at (3,6).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for a different apple that might be less contested or have a clearer path.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (3,6) is right next to me, and there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLet me consider the enemy's possible moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,6). It could move up, down, left, or right, but I don't know its strategy.\n\nIf I eat the apple at (3,6), I grow, and then I need to plan my path to the next apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for a different apple that might be easier to reach without crossing paths with the enemy.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6,3), which is at row 6, column 3.\n\nFrom my current position at (3,5), moving to (6,3) would require moving down two rows (since delta Y is 6 - 5 = 1, but I need to go to Y=3 from Y=5, which is down 2 rows) and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, no. My Y coordinates increase upwards, so from Y=5 to Y=3, that's down by 2 rows.\n\nAnd from X=3 to X=6, that's right by 3 columns.\n\nSo, move down 2, right 3.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (3,5) to (3,3), that's down 2 rows.\n\nThen from (3,3) to (6,3), that's right 3 columns.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any obstacles in between.\n\nAlso, considering that I need to make multiple moves, and the enemy might be moving as well.\n\nThis seems complicated for just one move decision.\n\nMaybe I should stick with the closest apple, which is at (3,6), just one move up from my current position.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can reassess the situation.\n\nAdditionally, since the enemy is at (9,6), which is far away from my current position, and assuming it doesn't move towards me immediately, I should be safe for now.\n\nBut I need to think about the long term. If I eat the apple at (3,6), I grow, and then I need to navigate to another apple without hitting anything.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for the apple at (7,8), which is at row 7, column 8.\n\nFrom (3,5), that's down 2 rows and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, no. From (3,5) to (7,8) is up 4 rows and right 3 columns.\n\nWait, Y increases upwards, so from Y=5 to Y=8 is up 3 rows.\n\nWait, Y=5 to Y=8 is up 3 rows (since 8-5=3).\n\nAnd X from 3 to 7 is right 4 columns.\n\nSo, total moves: 3 up and 4 right, totaling 7 moves.\n\nThat seems farther than the apple at (3,6), which is just 1 move up.\n\nAlso, moving to (3,6) doesn't require navigating around any obstacles, as far as I"

There are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2). There's also an enemy snake at (8,6) with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . .

A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (7,9)\n\n- (6,3)\n\n- (7,8)\n\n- (1,2)\n\nMy snake is at (3,6), which is row 3, column 6.\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,6), which is row 8, column 6.\n\nFirst, I need to decide which apple to go for. I should consider the closest apple and the path to it, making sure it's safe and doesn't lead me into the enemy or a wall.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple from my current position (3,6):\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: |9-3| = 6\n\n- Delta Y: |0-6| = 6\n\n- Total moves: 12\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |9-6| = 3\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: |6-3| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |3-6| = 3\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\n4. (7,8):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |8-6| = 2\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\n5. (1,2):\n\n- Delta X: |1-3| = 2\n\n- Delta Y: |2-6| = 4\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2), all with 6 moves.\n\nNow, I need to consider the paths to these apples and see which one is the safest.\n\nLet's look at each path:\n\n1. To (6,3):\n\n- From (3,6), go down to (6,6), then left to (6,3).\n\n- But looking at the board, there's an apple at (6,3), and an enemy snake at (8,6).\n\n- I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,6), which is below me at (3,6). So, going down to (6,6) might bring me closer to the enemy.\n\n- I need to see if the enemy is moving. But since I don't know its direction, I should assume it could move towards me.\n\n- Maybe it's better to avoid going down.\n\n2. To (7,8):\n\n- From (3,6), go right to (7,6), then up to (7,8).\n\n- Looking at the board, there's an apple at (7,9), but not directly in my path.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,6), which is to the right and down from my position.\n\n- If I go right to (7,6), I'm getting closer to the enemy.\n\n- Again, potential conflict with the enemy.\n\n3. To (1,2):\n\n- From (3,6), go left to (1,6), then down to (1,2).\n\n- The enemy is at (8,6), which is to the right, so moving left away from it seems safer.\n\n- Looking at the board, there's an apple at (1,2), and no immediate obstacles.\n\n- This seems like a safer path.\n\nAlso, considering that after eating an apple, I grow, so I need to make sure that my path after eating is clear.\n\nLet me think about growing.\n\nWhen I eat an apple, my snake grows by one segment. So, my tail will stay where it was until the rest of my body moves.\n\nI need to make sure that after eating, I don't immediately turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for the immediate move, I just need to ensure that the next move is safe.\n\nGiven that, maybe going for (1,2) is the best option, as it's away from the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (3,6), which is right at my current position.

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to make my next move. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board setup. The board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (3,7). There are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (7,8), and (1,2). There's also an enemy snake at (8,7), with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nLet me try to visualize this board. From the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 7: . . . 2 . . . . 1 .\n\nRow 6: . . . T . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (3,7), which is column 3, row 7. The enemy snake is at (8,7), which is column 8, row 7.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, so I should consider which one is closest and safest to reach.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: |9-3| = 6\n\n- Delta Y: |0-7| = 7\n\n- Total moves: 13\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |9-7| = 2\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: |6-3| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |3-7| = 4\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\n4. (7,8):\n\n- Delta X: |7-3| = 4\n\n- Delta Y: |8-7| = 1\n\n- Total moves: 5\n\n5. (1,2):\n\n- Delta X: |1-3| = 2\n\n- Delta Y: |2-7| = 5\n\n- Total moves: 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,8) with 5 moves, followed by (7,9) at 6 moves, and the others at 7 moves.\n\nNow, I need to think about the path to each apple and consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (7,8):\n\n- From (3,7), I need to move right to (7,7), then up to (7,8).\n\n- But the enemy snake is at (8,7), which is to the right of my target position.\n\n- I need to make sure the enemy doesn't block my path or intercept me.\n\n- The enemy is only one position away from my path, at (8,7).\n\n- If the enemy moves left, it could potentially block my path.\n\n- However, I can reach (7,7) before the enemy can reach it from (8,7), assuming it takes one move.\n\n- So, it might be safe to go for (7,8).\n\nNext, the apple at (7,9):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (7,7), then up to (7,9).\n\n- That's a total of 4 right moves and 2 up moves, totaling 6 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is adjacent to my path.\n\n- Similar to the previous apple, the enemy could potentially block my path, but I should reach (7,7) first.\n\n- Perhaps still manageable.\n\nThe apple at (6,3):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (6,7), then down to (6,3).\n\n- That's 3 right moves and 4 down moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is below and to the right.\n\n- Less likely to interfere with this path.\n\n- However, moving down exposes me to the enemy if it moves down as well.\n\nThe apple at (1,2):\n\n- From (3,7), move left to (1,7), then down to (1,2).\n\n- That's 2 left moves and 5 down moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (8,7), which is to the right.\n\n- Moving left seems safer, as the enemy is to the right.\n\n- But I need to ensure that there are no other obstacles or that the enemy doesn't move towards me.\n\nThe apple at (9,0):\n\n- From (3,7), move right to (9,7), then down to (9,0).\n\n- That's 6 right moves and 7 down moves, totaling 13 moves.\n\n- That's a long path, and the enemy could potentially intercept me.\n\nGiven these options, the apple at (7,8) seems the closest, requiring only 5 moves. Although the enemy is nearby, I believe I can reach it before the enemy can block my path.\n\nLet me think about the sequence of moves to get to (7,8):\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move right to (7,7)\n\n5. Move up to (7,8)\n\nEach move takes one turn, so in 5 moves, I can reach (7,8).\n\nNow, considering the enemy is at (8,7). If it moves left, it could reach (7,7) in one move, which would be concurrent with my arrival at (7,7). But since I need to move to (7,8) from (7,7), and the enemy is at (7,7), I need to make sure I can move to (7,8) without collision.\n\nIn Snake games, if two snakes occupy the same space, the longer snake survives, or both die, depending on the rules. But in this case, since we're both head-to-head, and assuming standard Snake rules, if we both move into the same space, we both die.\n\nTherefore, I need to avoid such a collision.\n\nTo prevent this, I can try to reach (7,8) before the enemy can reach (7,7). But since we both can move there in one move, it's a race.\n\nPerhaps I should consider another path or another apple to avoid this risk.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to trick the enemy into moving away by feinting a different direction.\n\nBut since I don't have control over the enemy's movements, I need to plan based on possible scenarios.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (7,9) instead.\n\nPath to (7,9):\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move right to (7,7)\n\n5. Move up to (7,8)\n\n6. Move up to (7,9)\n\nThat's 6 moves, which is more than the 5 moves to (7,8), but it might be safer because it's higher up, away from the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,7), so if I go to (7,9), the enemy would have to move up twice to reach (8,9), which is not directly in my path.\n\nTherefore, going for (7,9) might be a safer option.\n\nAlternatively, consider the apple at (6,3), which is at (6,3):\n\nPath:\n\n1. Move right to (4,7)\n\n2. Move right to (5,7)\n\n3. Move right to (6,7)\n\n4. Move down to (6,6)\n\n5. Move down to (6,5)\n\n6. Move down to (6,4)\n\n7. Move down to (6,3)\n\nThat's 7 moves, which is longer, but the enemy is at (8,7), which is below me, so moving down might expose me to the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (8,7), which is below me at (3,7). So moving down brings me closer to the enemy.\n\nThat might not be a good idea.\n\nNow, consider the apple at (1,2):\n\nPath:\n\n1. Move left to (2,7)\n\n2. Move left to (1,7)\n\n3. Move down to (1,6)\n\n4. Move down to (1,5)\n\n5. Move down to (1,4)\n\n6. Move down to (1,3)\n\n7. Move down to (1,2)\n\nThat's 7 moves as well.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,7), which is to the right and below me.\n\nMoving left away from the enemy seems safer.\n\nBut I need to ensure"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to make my next move. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board setup. The board is 10x10, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. That means higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (1,7). Wait, in the last move information, it says I'm at (3,7), but in the initial information, it says I'm at (1,7). Maybe there's a confusion here. Let me check the board state.\n\nFrom the board state provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . 1 . .\n\nRow 7: . . . 2 . . . . T . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . A . . .\n\nRow 2: .

The enemy snake is at (7,7), which is column 7, row 7, and its body is at (7,6).\n\nWait, in the board state, '1' is at (7,7), and 'T' is at (7,6), assuming 'T' is the tail of the enemy snake.\n\nThere are apples at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (1,2), and (4,2).\n\nWait, in the initial information, it says apples are at (9,0), (7,9), (6,3), (1,2), and (4,2), but looking at the board state, apples are shown at (7,9), (6,3), (1,2), and (0,9). Wait, (0,9) is the bottom right corner, but according to the coordinates, (0,0) is bottom left, so (0,9) is top left.\n\nWait, in row 9, column 7 is 'A', which is (7,9), row 3, column 6 is 'A', which is (6,3), row 2, column 1 is 'A', which is (1,2), and row 0, column 9 is 'A', which is (9,0). So that matches.\n\nAlso, there's an 'A' at (4,2), which might be another apple.\n\nSo, my position is (1,7), enemy snake is at (7,7) and (7,6).\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, so I should consider which one is closest and safest to reach.\n\nLet me calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n1. (9,0):\n\n- Delta X: |9-1| = 8\n\n- Delta Y: |0-7| = 7\n\n- Total moves: 15\n\n2. (7,9):\n\n- Delta X: |7-1| = 6\n\n- Delta Y: |9-7| = 2\n\n- Total moves: 8\n\n3. (6,3):\n\n- Delta X: |6-1| = 5\n\n- Delta Y: |3-7| = 4\n\n- Total moves: 9\n\n4. (1,2):\n\n- Delta X: |1-1| = 0\n\n- Delta Y: |2-7| = 5\n\n- Total moves: 5\n\n5. (4,2):\n\n- Delta X: |4-1| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |2-7| = 5\n\n- Total moves: 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,2) with 5 moves, followed by (7,9) and (4,2) at 8 moves, and (6,3) at 9 moves, and (9,0) at 15 moves.\n\nNow, I need to think about the path to each apple and consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (1,2):\n\n- From (1,7), I need to move down to (1,2).\n\n- That's 5 moves down.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,7), which is to the right and at the same row.\n\n- The enemy would have to move left to intercept me, but it's several columns away.\n\n- It would take the enemy at least 6 moves to reach (1,7), assuming it moves left each time.\n\n- Since I can reach (1,2) in 5 moves, I should be able to get the apple before the enemy can reach me.\n\n- Also, moving down doesn't put me in the enemy's way.\n\n- This seems like a safe option.\n\nNext, the apple at (7,9):\n\n- From (1,7), move right to (7,7), then up to (7,9).\n\n- That's 6 right moves and 2 up moves, totaling 8 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,7), so it's right in my path.\n\n- If I move right to (2,7), the enemy could move to (7,7), but I still need to cover 5 more right moves to reach (7,7), and then 2 up moves.\n\n- The enemy might try to block my path, but I think I can reach (7,9) before the enemy can surround me.\n\n- However, this seems riskier compared to going for (1,2).\n\nThe apple at (4,2):\n\n- From (1,7), move right to (4,7), then down to (4,2).\n\n- That's 3 right moves and 5 down moves, totaling 8 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,7), which is to the right.\n\n- Moving right towards (4,7) might bring me closer to the enemy, but I can still move down after that.\n\n- It might be safer than going all the way right to (7,9), but still riskier than going down to (1,2).\n\nThe apple at (6,3):\n\n- From (1,7), move right to (6,7), then down to (6,3).\n\n- That's 5 right moves and 4 down moves, totaling 9 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,7), which is close to my path.\n\n- This seems longer and potentially riskier.\n\nThe apple at (9,0):\n\n- From (1,7), move right to (9,7), then down to (9,0).\n\n- That's 8 right moves and 7 down moves, totaling 15 moves.\n\n- That's a long path, and the enemy could easily intercept me.\n\nGiven these options, the apple at (1,2) seems the closest and safest to reach. I can get there in 5 moves without crossing paths with the enemy, who would take at least 6 moves to reach my current position.\n\nTherefore, I should go for the apple at (1,2).\n\nNow, to get there, I need to move down 5 times.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles or other snakes in my way.\n\nLooking at the board state, from row 7 down to row 2, column 1 is empty.\n\nSo, I can safely move down to (1,6), then (1,5), (1,4), (1,3), and finally (1,2).\n\nNo issues there.\n\nAlso, the enemy is at (7,7), which is in a different column, so it shouldn't interfere with my path.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be down.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that moving down doesn't put me in a position where the enemy can cut me off.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible moves.\n\nIf the enemy moves left towards me, but it's at (7,7), and I'm at (1,7). The enemy would need to move left 6 times to reach (1,7), which would take 6 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, I can reach (1,2) in 5 moves.\n\nSo, even if the enemy moves left each time, it won't reach me before I get the apple.\n\nTherefore, moving down is safe.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (1,2), I will grow longer, which might give me an advantage in case the enemy tries to block me.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting this apple seems like the best strategy.\n\nSo, my next move should be down.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{DOWN}} \\]"

(4,2):\n\n- Delta X: |4-1| = 3\n\n- Delta Y: |2-5| = 3\n\n- Total moves: 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (1,2) with 3 moves, followed by (4,2) at 6 moves, (6,3) at 7 moves, (7,9) at 10 moves, and (9,0) at 13 moves.\n\nNow, I need to think about the path to each apple and consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nFirst, let's consider the apple at (1,2):\n\n- From (1,5), I need to move down to (1,2).\n\n- That's 3 moves down.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,8), which is to the right and above me.\n\n- The enemy would have to move left and down to intercept me, but it's several columns away.\n\n- It would take the enemy at least 7 moves to reach (1,5), assuming it moves left and down efficiently.\n\n- Since I can reach (1,2) in 3 moves, I should be able to get the apple before the enemy can reach me.\n\n- Also, moving down doesn't put me in the enemy's way.\n\n- This seems like a safe option.\n\nNext, the apple at (4,2):\n\n- From (1,5), move right to (4,5), then down to (4,2).\n\n- That's 3 right moves and 3 down moves, totaling 6 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,8), which is to the right and above.\n\n- Moving right towards (4,5) might bring me closer to the enemy, but I can still move down after that.\n\n- The enemy might try to block my path, but I think I can reach (4,2) before the enemy can surround me.\n\n- However, this seems riskier compared to going for (1,2).\n\nThe apple at (6,3):\n\n- From (1,5), move right to (6,5), then down to (6,3).\n\n- That's 5 right moves and 2 down moves, totaling 7 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,8), which is to the right and above.\n\n- Moving right towards (6,5) might bring me closer to the enemy, but I can still move down after that.\n\n- The enemy might try to block my path, but I think I can reach (6,3) before the enemy can surround me.\n\n- This seems riskier than going for (1,2).\n\nThe apple at (7,9):\n\n- From (1,5), move right to (7,5), then up to (7,9).\n\n- That's 6 right moves and 4 up moves, totaling 10 moves.\n\n- The enemy is at (7,8), which is close to my path.\n\n- If I move right to (2,5), the enemy could move down to intercept me.\n\n- This seems longer and potentially riskier.\n\nThe apple at (9,0):\n\n- From (1,5), move right to (9,5), then down to (9,0).\n\n- That's 8 right moves and 5 down moves, totaling 13 moves.\n\n- That's a long path, and the enemy could easily intercept me.\n\nGiven these options, the apple at (1,2) seems the closest and safest to reach. I can get there in 3 moves without crossing paths with the enemy, who would take at least 7 moves to reach my current position.\n\nTherefore, I should go for the apple at (1,2).\n\nNow, to get there, I need to move down 3 times.\n\nBut I need to make sure there are no obstacles or other snakes in my way.\n\nLooking at the board state, from row 5 down to row 2, column 1 is empty.\n\nSo, I can safely move down to (1,4), then (1,3), and finally (1,2).\n\nNo issues there.\n\nAlso, the enemy is at (7,8), which is in a different column, so it shouldn't interfere with my path.\n\nTherefore, my next move should be down.\n\nWait, but I need to make sure that moving down doesn't put me in a position where the enemy can cut me off.\n\nLet me think about the enemy's possible moves.\n\nIf the enemy moves left towards me, but it's at (7,8), and I'm at (1,5). The enemy would need to move left 6 times to reach (1,8), but that's still above me.\n\nMeanwhile, I can reach (1,2) in 3 moves.\n\nThe enemy would have to strategically move down as well to intercept me, but it would take more moves for the enemy to reach me.\n\nSo, moving down seems safe.\n\nAdditionally, after eating the apple at (1,2), I will grow longer, which might give me an advantage in case the enemy tries to block me.\n\nBut for now, focusing on getting this apple seems like the best strategy.\n\nSo, my next move should be down.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{DOWN}} \\]"
