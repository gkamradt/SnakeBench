This could also be a good move to gain a point.\n\n3. I could stay put at (0, 9) and wait for a better opportunity to move.\n\nHowever, I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake at (7, 4). I don't want to collide with it and die.\n\nConsidering the risks and potential rewards, I think my best move for now is to go UP to (0, 8). This will get me closer to the apple at (7, 0) without directly approaching the enemy snake.\n\nFor my next turn, I will consider moving left to (0, 9) to get closer to the apple at (0, 1), or continuing up to (0, 7) to try and eat the apple at (7, 0). I'll need to keep an eye on the enemy snake's position and adjust my strategy accordingly.\n\nMy next move: UP."
