Since I'm currently at (4, 9), I can move up (DOWN would take me outside the board), left (LEFT would collide with snake #2), and right (RIGHT is a potential move).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples. Moving right would bring me closer to the apple at (5, 8), but it doesn't guarantee that I'll be able to eat it without encountering snake #2 or running into a wall. Moving up would take me away from the apples, but it's a safe move for now.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to move towards the apples while avoiding collisions.\n\nNext move: UP."

Move towards the nearest apple that is safest to reach.\n2. Avoid collision with walls and other snakes.\n\n### Evaluating Apples:\n- Closest apple: (1, 3) at a distance of 2 units vertically and 1 unit horizontally.\n- (6, 5) is far away.\n- (1, 7) is slightly out of the way but closer in terms of vertical distance.\n- (7, 7) and (5, 8) are too far and not directly accessible without probable danger from walls or colliding with the enemy.\n\n### Direction Choices:\n- To go towards (6, 5), need to move RIGHT then UP. But this is far.\n- To go towards (1, 3), can move either UP or RIGHT but UP is faster route.\n- To go towards (1, 7), need to come down then left (frisker it's dangerous).\n\nConsidering the immediate safety and closeness to an apple, the best immediate move seems to be to move towards (1, 3). The apple (1,3) is down and to left of my position. To do so safely, I need to move DOWN first, then future moves will nourish.\n\n### Next Move:\nDOWN."
