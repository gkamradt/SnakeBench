The nearest apple that I can safely approach without the risk of running into a wall or another snake seems to be located at (5, 4), but this would require multiple moves crossing through (5, 7) and downward.\n\nHere is my thought process for this move:\n\n1. **Safety Concerns**: Although there is another snake (#2) on the board currently at (4, 1), it doesn't pose an immediate threat to my snake, as it's quite far. However, observing its movements would be crucial.\n\n2. **Pathfinding to Apple**: The closest apples on the same row (horizontal path) are located at y=6, x=9 and y=2, x=9, but moving directly right towards x=9 from my current position has two problems:\n   - The distance is longer.\n   - Moving directly towards (9,6) from (2,7) itself takes multiple turns.\n\n3. **Immediate Risk and Movement**: Since I need to eventually turn right, making the shortest route towards any apple, either I move up or continue staying on the same row for now. Since moving upwards to y=8 presents no immediate advantage and moving down decreases the vertical proximity to the nearest apple, staying on the same latitude while moving horizontally should be prioritized.\n\nGiven these insights, the best immediate strategy involves moving RIGHT. This direction will start encroaching towards the central region of the board, thus providing more flexibility in responding to future apple spawns and enemy movements, while conservatively steering clear of the walls and maintaining current y-position which is advantageous at the moment.\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT.**"

Instead, moving up towards the apple at (5, 4) would be a better strategy, as it keeps the snake in a more central position and closer to multiple apples.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\n- Continue moving up to approach the apple at (5, 4).\n- Keep an eye on the enemy snake's movements to avoid any potential collisions.\n\n**Next move: UP**"
