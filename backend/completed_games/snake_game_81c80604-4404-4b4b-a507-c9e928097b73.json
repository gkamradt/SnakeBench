Going for this apple would keep me more central on the board and away from the edges, giving me better maneuverability.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (8, 7), which is two steps to the right and three steps up from my current position. This would also keep me relatively central on the board, but it might put me closer to the enemy snake at (0, 9).\n\nI think the best move for now is to head towards the apple at (4, 8) by going UP. This will keep me away from the edges and the enemy snake while also giving me a chance to grab an apple.\n\nDecided next move: UP\n\nStrategy for the next turn: Reassess the board state and the positions of the apples and enemy snakes. Continue to prioritize staying central on the board, avoiding edges and corners, and maintaining a safe distance from potential threats."
