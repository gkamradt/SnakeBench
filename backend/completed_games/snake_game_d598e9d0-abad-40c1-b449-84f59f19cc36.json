Since there are apples at (9, 8) and (4, 8), it might be beneficial to move towards the upper part of the board to reach those apples in the future.\n\nGiven these considerations, I will move towards the apple at (5, 6) for now, but I will keep an eye on the upper part of the board for future moves.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Keep an eye on the upper part of the board and try to move towards the apples there when the opportunity arises.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
