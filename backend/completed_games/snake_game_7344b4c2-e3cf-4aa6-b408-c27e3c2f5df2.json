However, this move means taking a longer route and risks the enemy snake getting bigger if it consumes the apple at (7, 2) meanwhile.\n\nMoving RIGHT will take me in a straight line to the apple at (5, 2) if I move DOWN afterwards. But it's riskier as it brings me closer to the position of the enemy snake, especially if it decides to move up.\n\nMoving UP will keep me safe but will not bring me any closer to the apples. However, it gives me time to observe the enemy snake's move, which could be vital in deciding my next path and can allow me to avoid it in the upcoming moves.\n\nConsidering these facts, I believe moving LEFT toward the wall is a safer option right now. After making the move, I can consider moving downwards towards the apple at (3, 1), once enemy snake's move is observed.\n\nNext move: LEFT."

Additionally, after this move, I still have access to further options in subsequent turns.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\nAfter moving to (5, 2) and collecting the apple, I should maintain focus on moving towards the remaining apples while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements to avoid any potential conflict.\n\n### Decided Next Move:\n- Move **LEFT** to (5, 2), collecting the apple there."
