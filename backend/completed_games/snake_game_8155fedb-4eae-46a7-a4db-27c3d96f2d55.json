            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (7,2). There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (6,4), (8,1), and (4,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,8), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: A (at 8,9), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 0,9)\n\nRow 8: dot, dot, dot, dot, 1 (snake 1 at 4,8), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 7: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 6: dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 4,6), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 5: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 4: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 6,4), dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 3: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 2: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, 2 (my snake at 7,2), dot, dot\n\nRow 1: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 8,1), dot\n\nRow 0: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nOkay, so I'm at (7,2), which is in row 2, column 7. I need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me list the apples:\n\n1. (8,9)\n\n2. (0,9)\n\n3. (6,4)\n\n4. (8,1)\n\n5. (4,6)\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Maybe the closest one to minimize the moves.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n1. To (8,9): |8-7| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n2. To (0,9): |0-7| + |9-2| = 7 + 7 = 14\n\n3. To (6,4): |6-7| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n4. To (8,1): |8-7| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n5. To (4,6): |4-7| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,1) with a distance of 2, followed by (6,4) at 3, then (4,6) at 7, (8,9) at 8, and (0,9) at 14.\n\nMaybe I should go for the closest apple at (8,1). But I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLet's see: from (7,2), I can move right to (8,2), then down to (8,1), which is the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any snakes or walls in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, at (8,2), it's dot, and at (8,1), it's apple. So, it's clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the other snake at (4,8). It's pretty far away, and it doesn't have any body parts, so it's less of a concern for now.\n\nSo, my plan is to move right to (8,2), then down to (8,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that moving right to (8,2) is safe. Let's check the surroundings.\n\nAt (8,2), it's dot, which is fine. Then moving down to (8,1), which is the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I will grow, so my tail will extend. But since it's just one move, I don't need to worry about hitting my own tail yet.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move right to (8,2).\n\nBut, I should also think about the next move. After moving right to (8,2), I will need to move down to (8,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that moving down from (8,2) is safe. Let's see:\n\nAt (8,1), it's the apple, which is fine. After eating it, I grow, so my tail extends.\n\nBut, I need to plan further ahead. After eating the apple at (8,1), what's my next target?\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (6,4), (4,6), (8,9), (0,9).\n\nThe closest one from (8,1) would be (8,9), which is up 8 units. But there might be better options.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (6,4), which is left 2 and up 3 from (8,1).\n\nLet me calculate the distances from (8,1):\n\n- (6,4): |6-8| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-8| + |6-1| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n- (8,9): |8-8| + |9-1| = 0 + 8 = 8\n\n- (0,9): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16\n\nSo, the closest is (6,4) at 5 units.\n\nSo, after eating (8,1), I should head towards (6,4).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake or create a situation where I box myself in.\n\nLooking at the board, from (8,1), moving left to (7,1), then (6,1), then up to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to ensure that the path is clear.\n\nAt (7,1): dot\n\nAt (6,1): dot\n\nAt (6,2): dot\n\nAt (6,3): dot\n\nAt (6,4): apple\n\nSo, it seems clear.\n\nBut, I need to consider the growth of my snake. After eating the first apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail later on.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated for just one move.\n\nMaybe I should simplify and just focus on getting to the closest apple, which is (8,1), and worry about the rest later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for a different apple that might be easier or safer.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6,4), which is another close one with a distance of 3 from my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then up to (6,4).\n\nBut that's 2 moves away, whereas the apple at (8,1) is only 2 moves away as well.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider which path is less likely to encounter the other snake.\n\nThe other snake is at (4,8), and it's not moving yet, as per the information provided.\n\nBut in reality, snakes can move, so I need to anticipate possible movements.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the other snake's direction or intelligence, I'll assume it moves randomly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps sticking to the path towards (8,1) is safer, as it's on the edge of the board, and I can avoid the center where the other snake might be.\n\nBut, after eating (8,1), I need to be careful not to get boxed in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (6,4) first.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nOption 1: Go to (8,1)\n\n- Move right to (8,2)\n\n- Move down to (8,1)\n\n- Eat apple, grow\n\n- Move left to (7,1)\n\n- Move left to (6,1)\n\n- Move up to (6,2)\n\n- Move up to (6,3)\n\n- Move up to (6,4)\n\nThat's 8 moves in total.\n\nOption 2: Go directly to (6,4)\n\n- Move left to (6,2)\n\n- Move up to (6,3)\n\n- Move up to (6,4)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nBut, in Option 1, I eat one apple"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to make a move. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, my snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (7,3). The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (6,4), (8,1), and (4,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,9), but it doesn't have any body parts yet, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right. My goal is to eat apples and get points, while avoiding walls, other snakes, and myself.\n\nLet me visualize the board. Row 9 is the top row, and row 0 is the bottom row. Column 0 is the leftmost column, and column 9 is the rightmost.\n\nSo, I'm at (7,3), which is row 3, column 7.\n\nLet me list the apples and their distances from my current position using Manhattan distance.\n\n1. (8,9): |8-7| + |9-3| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n2. (0,9): |0-7| + |9-3| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n3. (6,4): |6-7| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n4. (8,1): |8-7| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n5. (4,6): |4-7| + |6-3| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,4) with a distance of 2, followed by (8,1) at distance 3.\n\nHmm, I need to decide which one to go for first. The closest one is (6,4), but (8,1) is also pretty close.\n\nLet me think about the paths.\n\nTo (6,4):\n\nFrom (7,3), I can move left to (6,3), then up to (6,4). That's two moves.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\nFrom (7,3), I can move right to (8,3), then down to (8,2), then down to (8,1). That's three moves.\n\nWait, is (8,1) really three moves away? Let's see:\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\nYes, that's three moves.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated the Manhattan distance to (8,1) as 3, but in terms of moves, it's actually three moves.\n\nWait, no. Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences in x and y coordinates, which corresponds directly to the number of moves if you can move in the four cardinal directions.\n\nSo, to (6,4), it's 1 left and 1 up, total 2 moves.\n\nTo (8,1), it's 1 right and 2 down, total 3 moves.\n\nSo, (6,4) is closer in terms of moves.\n\nBut, I should also consider the position of the other snake.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,9), and it's possible it will move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to make sure that the path to the apple doesn't lead me into the path of the other snake.\n\nLet me see where the other snake is.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,9), and there are no body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to anticipate where it might go.\n\nLooking at the apples, from its position at (4,9), the closest apple is at (0,9), which is 4 units away (Manhattan distance 4), or (8,9), which is 4 units away as well.\n\nAlternatively, (4,6) is 3 units down.\n\nSo, it might go towards (4,6) first.\n\nBut, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for (6,4), which is closer and not directly in the path of the other snake.\n\nLet me plan the path to (6,4):\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n- Left to (6,3)\n\n- Up to (6,4)\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), I will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (6,4) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest is (4,6) at 4 units.\n\nFrom (6,4), to (4,6):\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\n- Up to (4,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (8,1), which is 5 units away:\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nSo, (4,6) is closer.\n\nBut, I need to consider the position of the other snake.\n\nIf snake 1 goes towards (4,6), I might run into it.\n\nAlternatively, if I go towards (8,1), it's farther, but perhaps safer.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just focus on the closest apple, which is (6,4), and worry about the next one later.\n\nLet me proceed with that plan.\n\nSo, first move: left to (6,3).\n\nThen, up to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for now, just planning the first move.\n\nSo, moving left to (6,3).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, at (6,3), it's empty, as per the board state provided.\n\nSo, it's safe to move there.\n\nThen, next move would be up to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow, so my tail will be at (7,3), where I was previously.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto (7,3).\n\nBut, since I'm moving left to (6,3), and then up to (6,4), and then planning to move towards (4,6), I should be fine.\n\nWait, no. After eating the apple at (6,4), my tail is at (6,3), because that's where I came from.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, the tail extends in the direction you came from.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,3) to (6,3), then to (6,4), my tail will still be at (7,3).\n\nWait, no, in some Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows by one segment, so the tail stays where it was before you moved.\n\nWait, I need to clarify how the tail works in this game.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, your snake grows, meaning that your tail stays in place until the rest of your snake moves.\n\nSo, in this case, when I eat the apple at (6,4), my tail remains at (6,3), and as I continue moving, the tail stays there until the rest of the snake moves forward.\n\nWait, actually, in classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail stays in place until the rest of the snake moves past it.\n\nBut in this game, since it's turn-based, and we're making one move at a time, I need to understand how the tail moves.\n\nAssuming that the tail follows the head's movements, but with a delay equal to the length of the snake.\n\nSince I just ate an apple, my snake has grown by one unit, so the tail remains where it was in the previous turn.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me simplify it.\n\nSuppose I'm at (7,3). I move left to (6,3). Then, I move up to (6,4) and eat the apple.\n\nNow, my snake has grown, so my tail is still at (7,3).\n\nIf I move again, say to (6,5), my tail will stay at (7,3) until the entire snake has moved past it.\n\nBut perhaps in this game, it's simpler: when you eat an apple, your snake grows, and your tail remains in place until the rest of the snake moves.\n\nBut for now, since I'm only planning one move ahead, I just need to make sure that I don't move back"

There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (6,4), (8,1), and (4,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,8), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: A (at 8,9), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 0,9)\n\nRow 8: dot, dot, dot, dot, 1 (snake 1 at 4,8), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 7: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 6: dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 4,6), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 5: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 4: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 6,4), dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 3: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 2: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, 2 (my snake at 7,2), dot, dot\n\nRow 1: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 8,1), dot\n\nRow 0: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nOkay, so I'm at (7,2), which is in row 2, column 7. I need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me list the apples:\n\n1. (8,9)\n\n2. (0,9)\n\n3. (6,4)\n\n4. (8,1)\n\n5. (4,6)\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Maybe the closest one to minimize the moves.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n1. To (8,9): |8-7| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n2. To (0,9): |0-7| + |9-2| = 7 + 7 = 14\n\n3. To (6,4): |6-7| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n4. To (8,1): |8-7| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n5. To (4,6): |4-7| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,1) with a distance of 2, followed by (6,4) at 3, then (4,6) at 7, (8,9) at 8, and (0,9) at 14.\n\nMaybe I should go for the closest apple at (8,1). But I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLet's see: from (7,2), I can move right to (8,2), then down to (8,1), which is the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any snakes or walls in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, at (8,2), it's dot, and at (8,1), it's apple. So, it's clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the other snake at (4,8). It's pretty far away, and it doesn't have any body parts, so it's less of a concern for now.\n\nSo, my plan is to move right to (8,2), then down to (8,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that moving right to (8,2) is safe. Let's check the surroundings.\n\nAt (8,2), it's dot, which is fine. Then moving down to (8,1), which is the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I will grow, so my tail will extend. But since it's just one move, I don't need to worry about hitting my own tail yet.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move right to (8,2).\n\nBut, I should also think about the next move. After moving right to (8,2), I will need to move down to (8,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that moving down from (8,2) is safe. Let's see:\n\nAt (8,1), it's the apple, which is fine. After eating it, I grow, so my tail extends.\n\nBut, I need to plan further ahead. After eating the apple at (8,1), what's my next target?\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (6,4), (4,6), (8,9), (0,9).\n\nThe closest one from (8,1) would be (8,9), which is up 8 units. But there might be better options.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (6,4), which is left 2 and up 3 from (8,1).\n\nLet me calculate the distances from (8,1):\n\n- (6,4): |6-8| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-8| + |6-1| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n- (8,9): |8-8| + |9-1| = 0 + 8 = 8\n\n- (0,9): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16\n\nSo, the closest is (6,4) at 5 units.\n\nSo, after eating (8,1), I should head towards (6,4).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake or create a situation where I box myself in.\n\nLooking at the board, from (8,1), moving left to (7,1), then (6,1), then up to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to ensure that the path is clear.\n\nAt (7,1): dot\n\nAt (6,1): dot\n\nAt (6,2): dot\n\nAt (6,3): dot\n\nAt (6,4): apple\n\nSo, it seems clear.\n\nBut, I need to consider the growth of my snake. After eating the first apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail later on.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated for just one move.\n\nMaybe I should simplify and just focus on getting to the closest apple, which is (8,1), and worry about the rest later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for a different apple that might be easier or safer.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6,4), which is another close one with a distance of 3 from my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then up to (6,4).\n\nBut that's 2 moves away, whereas the apple at (8,1) is only 2 moves away as well.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider which path is less likely to encounter the other snake.\n\nThe other snake is at (4,8), and it's not moving yet, as per the information provided.\n\nBut in reality, snakes can move, so I need to anticipate possible movements.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the other snake's direction or intelligence, I'll assume it moves randomly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps sticking to the path towards (8,1) is safer, as it's on the edge of the board, and I can avoid the center where the other snake might be.\n\nBut, after eating (8,1), I need to be careful not to get boxed in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (6,4) first.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nOption 1: Go to (8,1)\n\n- Move right to (8,2)\n\n- Move down to (8,1)\n\n- Eat apple, grow\n\n- Move left to (7,1)\n\n- Move left to (6,1)\n\n- Move up to (6,2)\n\n- Move up to (6,3)\n\n- Move up to (6,4)\n\nThat's 8 moves in total.\n\nOption 2: Go directly to (6,4)\n\n- Move left to (6,2)\n\n- Move up to (6,3)\n\n- Move up to (6,4)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nBut, in Option 1, I eat one apple"

Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences in x and y coordinates, which corresponds directly to the number of moves if you can move in the four cardinal directions.\n\nSo, to (6,4), it's 1 left and 1 up, total 2 moves.\n\nTo (8,1), it's 1 right and 2 down, total 3 moves.\n\nSo, (6,4) is closer in terms of moves.\n\nBut, I should also consider the position of the other snake.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,9), and it's possible it will move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to make sure that the path to the apple doesn't lead me into the path of the other snake.\n\nLet me see where the other snake is.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,9), and there are no body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to anticipate where it might go.\n\nLooking at the apples, from its position at (4,9), the closest apple is at (0,9), which is 4 units away (Manhattan distance 4), or (8,9), which is 4 units away as well.\n\nAlternatively, (4,6) is 3 units down.\n\nSo, it might go towards (4,6) first.\n\nBut, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for (6,4), which is closer and not directly in the path of the other snake.\n\nLet me plan the path to (6,4):\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n- Left to (6,3)\n\n- Up to (6,4)\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), I will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (6,4) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest is (4,6) at 4 units.\n\nFrom (6,4), to (4,6):\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\n- Up to (4,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (8,1), which is 5 units away:\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nSo, (4,6) is closer.\n\nBut, I need to consider the position of the other snake.\n\nIf snake 1 goes towards (4,6), I might run into it.\n\nAlternatively, if I go towards (8,1), it's farther, but perhaps safer.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just focus on the closest apple, which is (6,4), and worry about the next one later.\n\nLet me proceed with that plan.\n\nSo, first move: left to (6,3).\n\nThen, up to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for now, just planning the first move.\n\nSo, moving left to (6,3).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, at (6,3), it's empty, as per the board state provided.\n\nSo, it's safe to move there.\n\nThen, next move would be up to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow, so my tail will be at (7,3), where I was previously.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto (7,3).\n\nBut, since I'm moving left to (6,3), and then up to (6,4), and then planning to move towards (4,6), I should be fine.\n\nWait, no. After eating the apple at (6,4), my tail is at (6,3), because that's where I came from.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, the tail extends in the direction you came from.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,3) to (6,3), then to (6,4), my tail will still be at (7,3).\n\nWait, no, in some Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows by one segment, so the tail stays where it was before you moved.\n\nWait, I need to clarify how the tail works in this game.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, your snake grows, meaning that your tail stays in place until the rest of your snake moves.\n\nSo, in this case, when I eat the apple at (6,4), my tail remains at (6,3), and as I continue moving, the tail stays there until the rest of the snake moves forward.\n\nWait, actually, in classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail stays in place until the rest of the snake moves past it.\n\nBut in this game, since it's turn-based, and we're making one move at a time, I need to understand how the tail moves.\n\nAssuming that the tail follows the head's movements, but with a delay equal to the length of the snake.\n\nSince I just ate an apple, my snake has grown by one unit, so the tail remains where it was in the previous turn.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me simplify it.\n\nSuppose I'm at (7,3). I move left to (6,3). Then, I move up to (6,4) and eat the apple.\n\nNow, my snake has grown, so my tail is still at (7,3).\n\nIf I move again, say to (6,5), my tail will stay at (7,3) until the entire snake has moved past it.\n\nBut perhaps in this game, it's simpler: when you eat an apple, your snake grows, and your tail remains in place until the rest of the snake moves.\n\nBut for now, since I'm only planning one move ahead, I just need to make sure that I don't move back"

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (6,4), (8,1), and (4,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,8), but it doesn't have any body parts yet, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right. My goal is to eat apples and get points, while avoiding walls, other snakes, and myself.\n\nLet me visualize the board. Row 9 is the top row, and row 0 is the bottom row. Column 0 is the leftmost column, and column 9 is the rightmost.\n\nSo, I'm at (7,4), which is row 4, column 7.\n\nLet me list the apples and their distances from my current position using Manhattan distance.\n\n1. (8,9): |8-7| + |9-4| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n2. (0,9): |0-7| + |9-4| = 7 + 5 = 12\n\n3. (6,4): |6-7| + |4-4| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n4. (8,1): |8-7| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n5. (4,6): |4-7| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,4) with a distance of 1, which is directly to my left.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. The apple is right next to me at (6,4). I can reach it by moving left.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe. Let's check if there's any obstacle there.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, at (6,4), there's an apple, and at (7,4), there's my head.\n\nMoving left to (6,4) should be safe because there's no other snake there, and it's within the board boundaries.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), my snake will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nI need to plan my next moves after eating this apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), I can consider which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (6,4) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apple from (6,4) is (4,6) with a distance of 4.\n\nAlternatively, (8,1) is at distance 5.\n\nI should consider which one to go for next.\n\nBut perhaps I should focus on just getting the closest apple first, which is (6,4), and then decide afterwards.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the other snake's position and potential movements.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,8), and it's possible it will move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to make sure that my path to the apple doesn't lead me into the path of the other snake.\n\nLooking at the board, snake 1 is at (4,8), and the apple at (4,6) is directly below it.\n\nSo, snake 1 might go down to eat the apple at (4,6).\n\nIf that's the case, and I go to (6,4), then I need to make sure that I don't cross paths with snake 1.\n\nBut right now, snake 1 is at (4,8), and I'm at (7,4). There's some distance between us.\n\nI think the immediate priority is to eat the closest apple at (6,4).\n\nAfter eating that, I can consider moving towards (4,6), but I need to be cautious of snake 1.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (8,1), which is farther but might be safer.\n\nBut, since (4,6) is closer, maybe I can get there before snake 1.\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,8), and the apple at (4,6) is two steps down.\n\nIf snake 1 moves down twice, it can reach (4,6).\n\nI'm at (7,4), and after eating (6,4), I can move towards (4,6) in four steps.\n\nSo, snake 1 might reach (4,6) before me if it moves directly there.\n\nTherefore, perhaps going for (8,1) would be a better choice in the long run.\n\nBut, for now, I'll stick with going for the closest apple at (6,4).\n\nAfter eating that, I'll have to decide whether to go for (4,6) or (8,1).\n\nPerhaps I'll cross that bridge when I get there.\n\nFor now, my immediate move is to go left to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nI need to make sure that after eating the apple, my tail extends, so I have to ensure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut since I'm only moving left once to eat the apple, and then planning to move up or down afterwards, I should be fine.\n\nSo, my decision for this turn is to move left to (6,4).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,8), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: A (at 8,9), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 0,9)\n\nRow 8: dot, dot, dot, dot, 1 (snake 1 at 4,8), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 7: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 6: dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 4,6), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 5: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 4: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 6,4), dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 3: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 2: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, 2 (my snake at 7,2), dot, dot\n\nRow 1: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 8,1), dot\n\nRow 0: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nOkay, so I'm at (7,2), which is in row 2, column 7. I need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me list the apples:\n\n1. (8,9)\n\n2. (0,9)\n\n3. (6,4)\n\n4. (8,1)\n\n5. (4,6)\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Maybe the closest one to minimize the moves.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n1. To (8,9): |8-7| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n2. To (0,9): |0-7| + |9-2| = 7 + 7 = 14\n\n3. To (6,4): |6-7| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n4. To (8,1): |8-7| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n5. To (4,6): |4-7| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,1) with a distance of 2, followed by (6,4) at 3, then (4,6) at 7, (8,9) at 8, and (0,9) at 14.\n\nMaybe I should go for the closest apple at (8,1). But I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLet's see: from (7,2), I can move right to (8,2), then down to (8,1), which is the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any snakes or walls in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, at (8,2), it's dot, and at (8,1), it's apple. So, it's clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the other snake at (4,8). It's pretty far away, and it doesn't have any body parts, so it's less of a concern for now.\n\nSo, my plan is to move right to (8,2), then down to (8,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that moving right to (8,2) is safe. Let's check the surroundings.\n\nAt (8,2), it's dot, which is fine. Then moving down to (8,1), which is the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I will grow, so my tail will extend. But since it's just one move, I don't need to worry about hitting my own tail yet.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move right to (8,2).\n\nBut, I should also think about the next move. After moving right to (8,2), I will need to move down to (8,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that moving down from (8,2) is safe. Let's see:\n\nAt (8,1), it's the apple, which is fine. After eating it, I grow, so my tail extends.\n\nBut, I need to plan further ahead. After eating the apple at (8,1), what's my next target?\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (6,4), (4,6), (8,9), (0,9).\n\nThe closest one from (8,1) would be (8,9), which is up 8 units. But there might be better options.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (6,4), which is left 2 and up 3 from (8,1).\n\nLet me calculate the distances from (8,1):\n\n- (6,4): |6-8| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-8| + |6-1| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n- (8,9): |8-8| + |9-1| = 0 + 8 = 8\n\n- (0,9): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16\n\nSo, the closest is (6,4) at 5 units.\n\nSo, after eating (8,1), I should head towards (6,4).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake or create a situation where I box myself in.\n\nLooking at the board, from (8,1), moving left to (7,1), then (6,1), then up to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to ensure that the path is clear.\n\nAt (7,1): dot\n\nAt (6,1): dot\n\nAt (6,2): dot\n\nAt (6,3): dot\n\nAt (6,4): apple\n\nSo, it seems clear.\n\nBut, I need to consider the growth of my snake. After eating the first apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail later on.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated for just one move.\n\nMaybe I should simplify and just focus on getting to the closest apple, which is (8,1), and worry about the rest later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for a different apple that might be easier or safer.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6,4), which is another close one with a distance of 3 from my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then up to (6,4).\n\nBut that's 2 moves away, whereas the apple at (8,1) is only 2 moves away as well.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider which path is less likely to encounter the other snake.\n\nThe other snake is at (4,8), and it's not moving yet, as per the information provided.\n\nBut in reality, snakes can move, so I need to anticipate possible movements.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the other snake's direction or intelligence, I'll assume it moves randomly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps sticking to the path towards (8,1) is safer, as it's on the edge of the board, and I can avoid the center where the other snake might be.\n\nBut, after eating (8,1), I need to be careful not to get boxed in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (6,4) first.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nOption 1: Go to (8,1)\n\n- Move right to (8,2)\n\n- Move down to (8,1)\n\n- Eat apple, grow\n\n- Move left to (7,1)\n\n- Move left to (6,1)\n\n- Move up to (6,2)\n\n- Move up to (6,3)\n\n- Move up to (6,4)\n\nThat's 8 moves in total.\n\nOption 2: Go directly to (6,4)\n\n- Move left to (6,2)\n\n- Move up to (6,3)\n\n- Move up to (6,4)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nBut, in Option 1, I eat one apple"

(4,6): |4-7| + |6-3| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,4) with a distance of 2, followed by (8,1) at distance 3.\n\nHmm, I need to decide which one to go for first. The closest one is (6,4), but (8,1) is also pretty close.\n\nLet me think about the paths.\n\nTo (6,4):\n\nFrom (7,3), I can move left to (6,3), then up to (6,4). That's two moves.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\nFrom (7,3), I can move right to (8,3), then down to (8,2), then down to (8,1). That's three moves.\n\nWait, is (8,1) really three moves away? Let's see:\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\nYes, that's three moves.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated the Manhattan distance to (8,1) as 3, but in terms of moves, it's actually three moves.\n\nWait, no. Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences in x and y coordinates, which corresponds directly to the number of moves if you can move in the four cardinal directions.\n\nSo, to (6,4), it's 1 left and 1 up, total 2 moves.\n\nTo (8,1), it's 1 right and 2 down, total 3 moves.\n\nSo, (6,4) is closer in terms of moves.\n\nBut, I should also consider the position of the other snake.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,9), and it's possible it will move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to make sure that the path to the apple doesn't lead me into the path of the other snake.\n\nLet me see where the other snake is.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,9), and there are no body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to anticipate where it might go.\n\nLooking at the apples, from its position at (4,9), the closest apple is at (0,9), which is 4 units away (Manhattan distance 4), or (8,9), which is 4 units away as well.\n\nAlternatively, (4,6) is 3 units down.\n\nSo, it might go towards (4,6) first.\n\nBut, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for (6,4), which is closer and not directly in the path of the other snake.\n\nLet me plan the path to (6,4):\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n- Left to (6,3)\n\n- Up to (6,4)\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), I will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (6,4) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest is (4,6) at 4 units.\n\nFrom (6,4), to (4,6):\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\n- Up to (4,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (8,1), which is 5 units away:\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nSo, (4,6) is closer.\n\nBut, I need to consider the position of the other snake.\n\nIf snake 1 goes towards (4,6), I might run into it.\n\nAlternatively, if I go towards (8,1), it's farther, but perhaps safer.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just focus on the closest apple, which is (6,4), and worry about the next one later.\n\nLet me proceed with that plan.\n\nSo, first move: left to (6,3).\n\nThen, up to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for now, just planning the first move.\n\nSo, moving left to (6,3).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, at (6,3), it's empty, as per the board state provided.\n\nSo, it's safe to move there.\n\nThen, next move would be up to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow, so my tail will be at (7,3), where I was previously.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto (7,3).\n\nBut, since I'm moving left to (6,3), and then up to (6,4), and then planning to move towards (4,6), I should be fine.\n\nWait, no. After eating the apple at (6,4), my tail is at (6,3), because that's where I came from.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, the tail extends in the direction you came from.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,3) to (6,3), then to (6,4), my tail will still be at (7,3).\n\nWait, no, in some Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows by one segment, so the tail stays where it was before you moved.\n\nWait, I need to clarify how the tail works in this game.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, your snake grows, meaning that your tail stays in place until the rest of your snake moves.\n\nSo, in this case, when I eat the apple at (6,4), my tail remains at (6,3), and as I continue moving, the tail stays there until the rest of the snake moves forward.\n\nWait, actually, in classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail stays in place until the rest of the snake moves past it.\n\nBut in this game, since it's turn-based, and we're making one move at a time, I need to understand how the tail moves.\n\nAssuming that the tail follows the head's movements, but with a delay equal to the length of the snake.\n\nSince I just ate an apple, my snake has grown by one unit, so the tail remains where it was in the previous turn.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me simplify it.\n\nSuppose I'm at (7,3). I move left to (6,3). Then, I move up to (6,4) and eat the apple.\n\nNow, my snake has grown, so my tail is still at (7,3).\n\nIf I move again, say to (6,5), my tail will stay at (7,3) until the entire snake has moved past it.\n\nBut perhaps in this game, it's simpler: when you eat an apple, your snake grows, and your tail remains in place until the rest of the snake moves.\n\nBut for now, since I'm only planning one move ahead, I just need to make sure that I don't move back"

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (6,4), (8,1), and (4,6).

(4,6): |4-7| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,4) with a distance of 1, which is directly to my left.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. The apple is right next to me at (6,4). I can reach it by moving left.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe. Let's check if there's any obstacle there.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, at (6,4), there's an apple, and at (7,4), there's my head.\n\nMoving left to (6,4) should be safe because there's no other snake there, and it's within the board boundaries.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), my snake will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nI need to plan my next moves after eating this apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), I can consider which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (6,4) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apple from (6,4) is (4,6) with a distance of 4.\n\nAlternatively, (8,1) is at distance 5.\n\nI should consider which one to go for next.\n\nBut perhaps I should focus on just getting the closest apple first, which is (6,4), and then decide afterwards.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the other snake's position and potential movements.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,8), and it's possible it will move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to make sure that my path to the apple doesn't lead me into the path of the other snake.\n\nLooking at the board, snake 1 is at (4,8), and the apple at (4,6) is directly below it.\n\nSo, snake 1 might go down to eat the apple at (4,6).\n\nIf that's the case, and I go to (6,4), then I need to make sure that I don't cross paths with snake 1.\n\nBut right now, snake 1 is at (4,8), and I'm at (7,4). There's some distance between us.\n\nI think the immediate priority is to eat the closest apple at (6,4).\n\nAfter eating that, I can consider moving towards (4,6), but I need to be cautious of snake 1.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (8,1), which is farther but might be safer.\n\nBut, since (4,6) is closer, maybe I can get there before snake 1.\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,8), and the apple at (4,6) is two steps down.\n\nIf snake 1 moves down twice, it can reach (4,6).\n\nI'm at (7,4), and after eating (6,4), I can move towards (4,6) in four steps.\n\nSo, snake 1 might reach (4,6) before me if it moves directly there.\n\nTherefore, perhaps going for (8,1) would be a better choice in the long run.\n\nBut, for now, I'll stick with going for the closest apple at (6,4).\n\nAfter eating that, I'll have to decide whether to go for (4,6) or (8,1).\n\nPerhaps I'll cross that bridge when I get there.\n\nFor now, my immediate move is to go left to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nI need to make sure that after eating the apple, my tail extends, so I have to ensure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut since I'm only moving left once to eat the apple, and then planning to move up or down afterwards, I should be fine.\n\nSo, my decision for this turn is to move left to (6,4).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

(2,8): |2-6| + |8-4| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6) with a distance of 4.\n\nBut wait, in my previous move, I thought the apple at (6,4) was the closest, but looking at the current positions, I see that there is an apple at (6,4), but in the board state you provided, it's actually at (7,4), which is where I am now. Wait, no, the board state shows:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, the apple is at (6,4), and I'm at (7,4). So, to eat that apple, I need to move left to (6,4).\n\nWait, but in the board state, it's shown as (7,4) for my position, but in the initial information, it's (6,4). There's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me double-check the initial information:\n\n\"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (6,4)\"\n\nBut in the board state, it shows:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, perhaps there's a mistake in the board state or the initial position.\n\nAssuming the initial position is correct, I'm at (6,4), and there's an apple at (6,4). Wait, that can't be, because if I'm at (6,4) and there's an apple there, I should have already eaten it.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (6,4), and I need to move to (6,4) to eat it.\n\nBut if I'm already at (6,4), then moving to (6,4) wouldn't make sense. Maybe the apple is at (7,4), where I am now.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify the positions.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\n- Row 4: positions (0,4) to (9,4)\n\n- Column 4: positions (0,4) to (0,9)\n\nWait, actually, the board is displayed with rows and columns, but I need to make sure I'm interpreting the coordinates correctly.\n\nIn the board state:\n\n- Row 9: positions (0,9) to (9,9)\n\n- Row 8: positions (0,8) to (9,8)\n\n...\n\n- Row 0: positions (0,0) to (9,0)\n\nAnd columns are from 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my position at (6,4) means column 6, row 4.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (8,9) is column 8, row 9.\n\nGiven that, in the board state, it shows:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, at (6,4), there's an apple, and at (7,4), there's my head.\n\nTherefore, to eat the apple at (6,4), I need to move left to (6,4).\n\nWait, but I'm already at (7,4), and the apple is at (6,4). So, moving left to (6,4) should be safe, as there's an apple there and no other snake.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe and that I don't collide with anything.\n\nLooking at the board, moving left from (7,4) to (6,4) is fine, as there's only the apple there.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I need to plan my next moves.\n\nLooking at the distances to other apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- (2,8): |2-6| + |8-4| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6) with a distance of 4.\n\nBut considering that snake 1 is at (4,7), which is close to (4,6), I need to be cautious.\n\nSnake 1 might move towards (4,6) as well.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider going for (8,1), which is at a distance of 5.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (4,6), but I need to see if I can get there before snake 1.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,7), and (4,6) is directly below it.\n\nIf snake 1 moves down, it can reach (4,6) before I can get there from (6,4).\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (8,1) would be a safer choice.\n\nBut (8,1) is at a distance of 5, while (4,6) is at 4.\n\nWait, but after eating the apple at (6,4), I can calculate the path.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, move left to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, from (6,4), I can consider moving towards (4,6) or (8,1).\n\nLet's calculate the steps:\n\nTo (4,6):\n\n- From (6,4) to (4,6): move left twice and up twice.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\n- From (6,4) to (8,1): move right twice and down three times.\n\nSo, to (4,6):\n\n1. Left to (5,4)\n\n2. Left to (4,4)\n\n3. Up to (4,5)\n\n4. Up to (4,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\n1. Right to (7,4)\n\n2. Right to (8,4)\n\n3. Down to (8,3)\n\n4. Down to (8,2)\n\n5. Down to (8,1)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nSo, going to (4,6) is faster.\n\nBut, as I mentioned earlier, snake 1 is at (4,7), and it can reach (4,6) in two moves:\n\n1. Down to (4,6)\n\nSo, if I go to (4,6) in four moves, snake 1 can reach there in two moves.\n\nTherefore, snake 1 will get to (4,6) before me.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for (8,1) instead.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to block snake 1's path to (4,6), but that might not be feasible given the distances.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (8,9), which is farther, but perhaps safer.\n\nBut it's at a distance of 7, which is quite far, and there might be other snakes moving towards it.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (8,1) is a better choice.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,4), I should head towards (8,1).\n\nBut first things first, I need to move left to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, from (6,4), I'll plan to go to (8,1).\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path is clear and that I don't run into snake 1 or any walls.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake.

There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,8), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: A (at 8,9), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 0,9)\n\nRow 8: dot, dot, dot, dot, 1 (snake 1 at 4,8), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 7: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 6: dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 4,6), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 5: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 4: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 6,4), dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 3: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 2: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, 2 (my snake at 7,2), dot, dot\n\nRow 1: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 8,1), dot\n\nRow 0: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nOkay, so I'm at (7,2), which is in row 2, column 7. I need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me list the apples:\n\n1. (8,9)\n\n2. (0,9)\n\n3. (6,4)\n\n4. (8,1)\n\n5. (4,6)\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Maybe the closest one to minimize the moves.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n1. To (8,9): |8-7| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n2. To (0,9): |0-7| + |9-2| = 7 + 7 = 14\n\n3. To (6,4): |6-7| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n4. To (8,1): |8-7| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n5. To (4,6): |4-7| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,1) with a distance of 2, followed by (6,4) at 3, then (4,6) at 7, (8,9) at 8, and (0,9) at 14.\n\nMaybe I should go for the closest apple at (8,1). But I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLet's see: from (7,2), I can move right to (8,2), then down to (8,1), which is the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any snakes or walls in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, at (8,2), it's dot, and at (8,1), it's apple. So, it's clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the other snake at (4,8). It's pretty far away, and it doesn't have any body parts, so it's less of a concern for now.\n\nSo, my plan is to move right to (8,2), then down to (8,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that moving right to (8,2) is safe. Let's check the surroundings.\n\nAt (8,2), it's dot, which is fine. Then moving down to (8,1), which is the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I will grow, so my tail will extend. But since it's just one move, I don't need to worry about hitting my own tail yet.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move right to (8,2).\n\nBut, I should also think about the next move. After moving right to (8,2), I will need to move down to (8,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that moving down from (8,2) is safe. Let's see:\n\nAt (8,1), it's the apple, which is fine. After eating it, I grow, so my tail extends.\n\nBut, I need to plan further ahead. After eating the apple at (8,1), what's my next target?\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (6,4), (4,6), (8,9), (0,9).\n\nThe closest one from (8,1) would be (8,9), which is up 8 units. But there might be better options.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (6,4), which is left 2 and up 3 from (8,1).\n\nLet me calculate the distances from (8,1):\n\n- (6,4): |6-8| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-8| + |6-1| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n- (8,9): |8-8| + |9-1| = 0 + 8 = 8\n\n- (0,9): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16\n\nSo, the closest is (6,4) at 5 units.\n\nSo, after eating (8,1), I should head towards (6,4).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake or create a situation where I box myself in.\n\nLooking at the board, from (8,1), moving left to (7,1), then (6,1), then up to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to ensure that the path is clear.\n\nAt (7,1): dot\n\nAt (6,1): dot\n\nAt (6,2): dot\n\nAt (6,3): dot\n\nAt (6,4): apple\n\nSo, it seems clear.\n\nBut, I need to consider the growth of my snake. After eating the first apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail later on.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated for just one move.\n\nMaybe I should simplify and just focus on getting to the closest apple, which is (8,1), and worry about the rest later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for a different apple that might be easier or safer.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6,4), which is another close one with a distance of 3 from my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then up to (6,4).\n\nBut that's 2 moves away, whereas the apple at (8,1) is only 2 moves away as well.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider which path is less likely to encounter the other snake.\n\nThe other snake is at (4,8), and it's not moving yet, as per the information provided.\n\nBut in reality, snakes can move, so I need to anticipate possible movements.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the other snake's direction or intelligence, I'll assume it moves randomly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps sticking to the path towards (8,1) is safer, as it's on the edge of the board, and I can avoid the center where the other snake might be.\n\nBut, after eating (8,1), I need to be careful not to get boxed in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (6,4) first.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nOption 1: Go to (8,1)\n\n- Move right to (8,2)\n\n- Move down to (8,1)\n\n- Eat apple, grow\n\n- Move left to (7,1)\n\n- Move left to (6,1)\n\n- Move up to (6,2)\n\n- Move up to (6,3)\n\n- Move up to (6,4)\n\nThat's 8 moves in total.\n\nOption 2: Go directly to (6,4)\n\n- Move left to (6,2)\n\n- Move up to (6,3)\n\n- Move up to (6,4)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nBut, in Option 1, I eat one apple"

However, it's quite far away, and I don't want to risk the enemy snake reaching it first.\n\nThe apple at (4, 6) is still the closest one, just 3 spaces directly below me.

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (6,4), (8,1), and (4,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,9), but it doesn't have any body parts yet, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right. My goal is to eat apples and get points, while avoiding walls, other snakes, and myself.\n\nLet me visualize the board. Row 9 is the top row, and row 0 is the bottom row. Column 0 is the leftmost column, and column 9 is the rightmost.\n\nSo, I'm at (7,3), which is row 3, column 7.\n\nLet me list the apples and their distances from my current position using Manhattan distance.\n\n1. (8,9): |8-7| + |9-3| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n2. (0,9): |0-7| + |9-3| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n3. (6,4): |6-7| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n4. (8,1): |8-7| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n5. (4,6): |4-7| + |6-3| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,4) with a distance of 2, followed by (8,1) at distance 3.\n\nHmm, I need to decide which one to go for first. The closest one is (6,4), but (8,1) is also pretty close.\n\nLet me think about the paths.\n\nTo (6,4):\n\nFrom (7,3), I can move left to (6,3), then up to (6,4). That's two moves.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\nFrom (7,3), I can move right to (8,3), then down to (8,2), then down to (8,1). That's three moves.\n\nWait, is (8,1) really three moves away? Let's see:\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\nYes, that's three moves.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated the Manhattan distance to (8,1) as 3, but in terms of moves, it's actually three moves.\n\nWait, no. Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences in x and y coordinates, which corresponds directly to the number of moves if you can move in the four cardinal directions.\n\nSo, to (6,4), it's 1 left and 1 up, total 2 moves.\n\nTo (8,1), it's 1 right and 2 down, total 3 moves.\n\nSo, (6,4) is closer in terms of moves.\n\nBut, I should also consider the position of the other snake.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,9), and it's possible it will move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to make sure that the path to the apple doesn't lead me into the path of the other snake.\n\nLet me see where the other snake is.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,9), and there are no body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to anticipate where it might go.\n\nLooking at the apples, from its position at (4,9), the closest apple is at (0,9), which is 4 units away (Manhattan distance 4), or (8,9), which is 4 units away as well.\n\nAlternatively, (4,6) is 3 units down.\n\nSo, it might go towards (4,6) first.\n\nBut, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for (6,4), which is closer and not directly in the path of the other snake.\n\nLet me plan the path to (6,4):\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n- Left to (6,3)\n\n- Up to (6,4)\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), I will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (6,4) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest is (4,6) at 4 units.\n\nFrom (6,4), to (4,6):\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\n- Up to (4,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (8,1), which is 5 units away:\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nSo, (4,6) is closer.\n\nBut, I need to consider the position of the other snake.\n\nIf snake 1 goes towards (4,6), I might run into it.\n\nAlternatively, if I go towards (8,1), it's farther, but perhaps safer.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just focus on the closest apple, which is (6,4), and worry about the next one later.\n\nLet me proceed with that plan.\n\nSo, first move: left to (6,3).\n\nThen, up to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for now, just planning the first move.\n\nSo, moving left to (6,3).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, at (6,3), it's empty, as per the board state provided.\n\nSo, it's safe to move there.\n\nThen, next move would be up to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow, so my tail will be at (7,3), where I was previously.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto (7,3).\n\nBut, since I'm moving left to (6,3), and then up to (6,4), and then planning to move towards (4,6), I should be fine.\n\nWait, no. After eating the apple at (6,4), my tail is at (6,3), because that's where I came from.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, the tail extends in the direction you came from.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,3) to (6,3), then to (6,4), my tail will still be at (7,3).\n\nWait, no, in some Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows by one segment, so the tail stays where it was before you moved.\n\nWait, I need to clarify how the tail works in this game.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, your snake grows, meaning that your tail stays in place until the rest of your snake moves.\n\nSo, in this case, when I eat the apple at (6,4), my tail remains at (6,3), and as I continue moving, the tail stays there until the rest of the snake moves forward.\n\nWait, actually, in classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail stays in place until the rest of the snake moves past it.\n\nBut in this game, since it's turn-based, and we're making one move at a time, I need to understand how the tail moves.\n\nAssuming that the tail follows the head's movements, but with a delay equal to the length of the snake.\n\nSince I just ate an apple, my snake has grown by one unit, so the tail remains where it was in the previous turn.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me simplify it.\n\nSuppose I'm at (7,3). I move left to (6,3). Then, I move up to (6,4) and eat the apple.\n\nNow, my snake has grown, so my tail is still at (7,3).\n\nIf I move again, say to (6,5), my tail will stay at (7,3) until the entire snake has moved past it.\n\nBut perhaps in this game, it's simpler: when you eat an apple, your snake grows, and your tail remains in place until the rest of the snake moves.\n\nBut for now, since I'm only planning one move ahead, I just need to make sure that I don't move back"

(2,8): |2-6| + |8-4| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6) with a distance of 4.\n\nBut wait, in my previous move, I thought the apple at (6,4) was the closest, but looking at the current positions, I see that there is an apple at (6,4), but in the board state you provided, it's actually at (7,4), which is where I am now. Wait, no, the board state shows:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, the apple is at (6,4), and I'm at (7,4). So, to eat that apple, I need to move left to (6,4).\n\nWait, but in the board state, it's shown as (7,4) for my position, but in the initial information, it's (6,4). There's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me double-check the initial information:\n\n\"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (6,4)\"\n\nBut in the board state, it shows:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, perhaps there's a mistake in the board state or the initial position.\n\nAssuming the initial position is correct, I'm at (6,4), and there's an apple at (6,4). Wait, that can't be, because if I'm at (6,4) and there's an apple there, I should have already eaten it.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (6,4), and I need to move to (6,4) to eat it.\n\nBut if I'm already at (6,4), then moving to (6,4) wouldn't make sense. Maybe the apple is at (7,4), where I am now.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify the positions.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\n- Row 4: positions (0,4) to (9,4)\n\n- Column 4: positions (0,4) to (0,9)\n\nWait, actually, the board is displayed with rows and columns, but I need to make sure I'm interpreting the coordinates correctly.\n\nIn the board state:\n\n- Row 9: positions (0,9) to (9,9)\n\n- Row 8: positions (0,8) to (9,8)\n\n...\n\n- Row 0: positions (0,0) to (9,0)\n\nAnd columns are from 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my position at (6,4) means column 6, row 4.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (8,9) is column 8, row 9.\n\nGiven that, in the board state, it shows:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, at (6,4), there's an apple, and at (7,4), there's my head.\n\nTherefore, to eat the apple at (6,4), I need to move left to (6,4).\n\nWait, but I'm already at (7,4), and the apple is at (6,4). So, moving left to (6,4) should be safe, as there's an apple there and no other snake.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe and that I don't collide with anything.\n\nLooking at the board, moving left from (7,4) to (6,4) is fine, as there's only the apple there.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I need to plan my next moves.\n\nLooking at the distances to other apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- (2,8): |2-6| + |8-4| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6) with a distance of 4.\n\nBut considering that snake 1 is at (4,7), which is close to (4,6), I need to be cautious.\n\nSnake 1 might move towards (4,6) as well.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider going for (8,1), which is at a distance of 5.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (4,6), but I need to see if I can get there before snake 1.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,7), and (4,6) is directly below it.\n\nIf snake 1 moves down, it can reach (4,6) before I can get there from (6,4).\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (8,1) would be a safer choice.\n\nBut (8,1) is at a distance of 5, while (4,6) is at 4.\n\nWait, but after eating the apple at (6,4), I can calculate the path.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, move left to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, from (6,4), I can consider moving towards (4,6) or (8,1).\n\nLet's calculate the steps:\n\nTo (4,6):\n\n- From (6,4) to (4,6): move left twice and up twice.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\n- From (6,4) to (8,1): move right twice and down three times.\n\nSo, to (4,6):\n\n1. Left to (5,4)\n\n2. Left to (4,4)\n\n3. Up to (4,5)\n\n4. Up to (4,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\n1. Right to (7,4)\n\n2. Right to (8,4)\n\n3. Down to (8,3)\n\n4. Down to (8,2)\n\n5. Down to (8,1)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nSo, going to (4,6) is faster.\n\nBut, as I mentioned earlier, snake 1 is at (4,7), and it can reach (4,6) in two moves:\n\n1. Down to (4,6)\n\nSo, if I go to (4,6) in four moves, snake 1 can reach there in two moves.\n\nTherefore, snake 1 will get to (4,6) before me.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for (8,1) instead.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to block snake 1's path to (4,6), but that might not be feasible given the distances.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (8,9), which is farther, but perhaps safer.\n\nBut it's at a distance of 7, which is quite far, and there might be other snakes moving towards it.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (8,1) is a better choice.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,4), I should head towards (8,1).\n\nBut first things first, I need to move left to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, from (6,4), I'll plan to go to (8,1).\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path is clear and that I don't run into snake 1 or any walls.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake.

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (8,1), (4,6), and (2,8). There's also another snake, number 1, at (3,7), but it doesn't have any body parts yet, so it's just the head.\n\nMy goal is to eat apples to gain points while avoiding walls, other snakes, and myself. I need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet me visualize the board. Row 9 is the top row, and row 0 is the bottom row. Column 0 is the leftmost column, and column 9 is the rightmost.\n\nSo, I'm at (5,4), which is row 4, column 5.\n\nLet me list the apples and their distances from my current position using Manhattan distance.\n\n1. (8,9): |8-5| + |9-4| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\n2. (0,9): |0-5| + |9-4| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n3. (8,1): |8-5| + |1-4| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n4. (4,6): |4-5| + |6-4| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n5. (2,8): |2-5| + |8-4| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6) with a distance of 3.\n\nBut I need to consider the position of the other snake. Snake 1 is at (3,7). If I go towards (4,6), I might cross paths with snake 1.\n\nLet me think about the path to (4,6):\n\nFrom (5,4):\n\n- Up to (5,5)\n\n- Left to (4,5)\n\n- Down to (4,6)\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nMeanwhile, snake 1 is at (3,7). If it moves down to (3,6), then to (3,5), and then to (4,5) or (4,6), it might reach the apple first.\n\nI need to consider if it's worth risking going for (4,6) or choosing a different apple that's less contested.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (8,1), which is at a distance of 6.\n\nPath to (8,1):\n\nFrom (5,4):\n\n- Right to (6,4)\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\nThat's six moves.\n\nSnake 1 would have to make its way down from (3,7) to (8,1), which would take more than six moves, so I might be safer going for (8,1).\n\nBut it's farther, and I might miss out on closer apples.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,8) is at a distance of 7, which is even farther.\n\nThe apple at (8,9) is at a distance of 8, which is the farthest.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider going for (4,6), despite the competition from snake 1, because it's closer.\n\nBut I need to make sure I can get there before snake 1.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves of snake 1.\n\nSnake 1 is at (3,7). If it moves down to (3,6), then (3,5), then (4,5), and then (4,6), it would take four moves to reach (4,6).\n\nMeanwhile, I can reach (4,6) in three moves, as I planned earlier.\n\nSo, if I move faster, I can reach (4,6) before snake 1.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path is clear and that I don't run into any walls or myself.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating the apple at (4,6), I will grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver afterward.\n\nLet me think about my next move.\n\nFirst, I need to move towards (4,6).\n\nFrom (5,4), the best direction is left to (4,4), then up to (4,5), and then up to (4,6).\n\nSo, for my immediate next move, I should move left to (4,4).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that at (4,4), there shouldn't be any obstacles.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I don't turn back into my own body.\n\nSince this is the first move, my body is just the head at (5,4), so no risk there.\n\nTherefore, moving left to (4,4) seems safe.\n\nAfter that, I can plan to move up to (4,5), and then to (4,6).\n\nBut I need to make sure that snake 1 doesn't block my path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (8,1), which is less contested, even though it's farther.\n\nBut considering the distances, going for (4,6) is quicker, and I have a higher chance of getting it before snake 1.\n\nSo, I think I'll go for (4,6).\n\nTherefore, my immediate move should be left to (4,4).\n\nAlright, I decide to move left.\n\n**Final Move: LEFT**"

There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (6,4), (8,1), and (4,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,8), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: A (at 8,9), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 0,9)\n\nRow 8: dot, dot, dot, dot, 1 (snake 1 at 4,8), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 7: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 6: dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 4,6), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 5: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 4: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 6,4), dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 3: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 2: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, 2 (my snake at 7,2), dot, dot\n\nRow 1: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 8,1), dot\n\nRow 0: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nOkay, so I'm at (7,2), which is in row 2, column 7. I need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me list the apples:\n\n1. (8,9)\n\n2. (0,9)\n\n3. (6,4)\n\n4. (8,1)\n\n5. (4,6)\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Maybe the closest one to minimize the moves.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n1. To (8,9): |8-7| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n2. To (0,9): |0-7| + |9-2| = 7 + 7 = 14\n\n3. To (6,4): |6-7| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n4. To (8,1): |8-7| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n5. To (4,6): |4-7| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,1) with a distance of 2, followed by (6,4) at 3, then (4,6) at 7, (8,9) at 8, and (0,9) at 14.\n\nMaybe I should go for the closest apple at (8,1). But I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLet's see: from (7,2), I can move right to (8,2), then down to (8,1), which is the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any snakes or walls in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, at (8,2), it's dot, and at (8,1), it's apple. So, it's clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the other snake at (4,8). It's pretty far away, and it doesn't have any body parts, so it's less of a concern for now.\n\nSo, my plan is to move right to (8,2), then down to (8,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that moving right to (8,2) is safe. Let's check the surroundings.\n\nAt (8,2), it's dot, which is fine. Then moving down to (8,1), which is the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I will grow, so my tail will extend. But since it's just one move, I don't need to worry about hitting my own tail yet.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move right to (8,2).\n\nBut, I should also think about the next move. After moving right to (8,2), I will need to move down to (8,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that moving down from (8,2) is safe. Let's see:\n\nAt (8,1), it's the apple, which is fine. After eating it, I grow, so my tail extends.\n\nBut, I need to plan further ahead. After eating the apple at (8,1), what's my next target?\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (6,4), (4,6), (8,9), (0,9).\n\nThe closest one from (8,1) would be (8,9), which is up 8 units. But there might be better options.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (6,4), which is left 2 and up 3 from (8,1).\n\nLet me calculate the distances from (8,1):\n\n- (6,4): |6-8| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-8| + |6-1| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n- (8,9): |8-8| + |9-1| = 0 + 8 = 8\n\n- (0,9): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16\n\nSo, the closest is (6,4) at 5 units.\n\nSo, after eating (8,1), I should head towards (6,4).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake or create a situation where I box myself in.\n\nLooking at the board, from (8,1), moving left to (7,1), then (6,1), then up to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to ensure that the path is clear.\n\nAt (7,1): dot\n\nAt (6,1): dot\n\nAt (6,2): dot\n\nAt (6,3): dot\n\nAt (6,4): apple\n\nSo, it seems clear.\n\nBut, I need to consider the growth of my snake. After eating the first apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail later on.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated for just one move.\n\nMaybe I should simplify and just focus on getting to the closest apple, which is (8,1), and worry about the rest later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for a different apple that might be easier or safer.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6,4), which is another close one with a distance of 3 from my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then up to (6,4).\n\nBut that's 2 moves away, whereas the apple at (8,1) is only 2 moves away as well.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider which path is less likely to encounter the other snake.\n\nThe other snake is at (4,8), and it's not moving yet, as per the information provided.\n\nBut in reality, snakes can move, so I need to anticipate possible movements.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the other snake's direction or intelligence, I'll assume it moves randomly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps sticking to the path towards (8,1) is safer, as it's on the edge of the board, and I can avoid the center where the other snake might be.\n\nBut, after eating (8,1), I need to be careful not to get boxed in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (6,4) first.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nOption 1: Go to (8,1)\n\n- Move right to (8,2)\n\n- Move down to (8,1)\n\n- Eat apple, grow\n\n- Move left to (7,1)\n\n- Move left to (6,1)\n\n- Move up to (6,2)\n\n- Move up to (6,3)\n\n- Move up to (6,4)\n\nThat's 8 moves in total.\n\nOption 2: Go directly to (6,4)\n\n- Move left to (6,2)\n\n- Move up to (6,3)\n\n- Move up to (6,4)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nBut, in Option 1, I eat one apple"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to make a move. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, my snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (7,3). The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (6,4), (8,1), and (4,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,9), but it doesn't have any body parts yet, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right. My goal is to eat apples and get points, while avoiding walls, other snakes, and myself.\n\nLet me visualize the board. Row 9 is the top row, and row 0 is the bottom row. Column 0 is the leftmost column, and column 9 is the rightmost.\n\nSo, I'm at (7,3), which is row 3, column 7.\n\nLet me list the apples and their distances from my current position using Manhattan distance.\n\n1. (8,9): |8-7| + |9-3| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n2. (0,9): |0-7| + |9-3| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n3. (6,4): |6-7| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n4. (8,1): |8-7| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n5. (4,6): |4-7| + |6-3| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,4) with a distance of 2, followed by (8,1) at distance 3.\n\nHmm, I need to decide which one to go for first. The closest one is (6,4), but (8,1) is also pretty close.\n\nLet me think about the paths.\n\nTo (6,4):\n\nFrom (7,3), I can move left to (6,3), then up to (6,4). That's two moves.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\nFrom (7,3), I can move right to (8,3), then down to (8,2), then down to (8,1). That's three moves.\n\nWait, is (8,1) really three moves away? Let's see:\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\nYes, that's three moves.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated the Manhattan distance to (8,1) as 3, but in terms of moves, it's actually three moves.\n\nWait, no. Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences in x and y coordinates, which corresponds directly to the number of moves if you can move in the four cardinal directions.\n\nSo, to (6,4), it's 1 left and 1 up, total 2 moves.\n\nTo (8,1), it's 1 right and 2 down, total 3 moves.\n\nSo, (6,4) is closer in terms of moves.\n\nBut, I should also consider the position of the other snake.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,9), and it's possible it will move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to make sure that the path to the apple doesn't lead me into the path of the other snake.\n\nLet me see where the other snake is.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,9), and there are no body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to anticipate where it might go.\n\nLooking at the apples, from its position at (4,9), the closest apple is at (0,9), which is 4 units away (Manhattan distance 4), or (8,9), which is 4 units away as well.\n\nAlternatively, (4,6) is 3 units down.\n\nSo, it might go towards (4,6) first.\n\nBut, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for (6,4), which is closer and not directly in the path of the other snake.\n\nLet me plan the path to (6,4):\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n- Left to (6,3)\n\n- Up to (6,4)\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), I will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (6,4) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest is (4,6) at 4 units.\n\nFrom (6,4), to (4,6):\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\n- Up to (4,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (8,1), which is 5 units away:\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nSo, (4,6) is closer.\n\nBut, I need to consider the position of the other snake.\n\nIf snake 1 goes towards (4,6), I might run into it.\n\nAlternatively, if I go towards (8,1), it's farther, but perhaps safer.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just focus on the closest apple, which is (6,4), and worry about the next one later.\n\nLet me proceed with that plan.\n\nSo, first move: left to (6,3).\n\nThen, up to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for now, just planning the first move.\n\nSo, moving left to (6,3).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, at (6,3), it's empty, as per the board state provided.\n\nSo, it's safe to move there.\n\nThen, next move would be up to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow, so my tail will be at (7,3), where I was previously.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto (7,3).\n\nBut, since I'm moving left to (6,3), and then up to (6,4), and then planning to move towards (4,6), I should be fine.\n\nWait, no. After eating the apple at (6,4), my tail is at (6,3), because that's where I came from.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, the tail extends in the direction you came from.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,3) to (6,3), then to (6,4), my tail will still be at (7,3).\n\nWait, no, in some Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows by one segment, so the tail stays where it was before you moved.\n\nWait, I need to clarify how the tail works in this game.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, your snake grows, meaning that your tail stays in place until the rest of your snake moves.\n\nSo, in this case, when I eat the apple at (6,4), my tail remains at (6,3), and as I continue moving, the tail stays there until the rest of the snake moves forward.\n\nWait, actually, in classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail stays in place until the rest of the snake moves past it.\n\nBut in this game, since it's turn-based, and we're making one move at a time, I need to understand how the tail moves.\n\nAssuming that the tail follows the head's movements, but with a delay equal to the length of the snake.\n\nSince I just ate an apple, my snake has grown by one unit, so the tail remains where it was in the previous turn.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me simplify it.\n\nSuppose I'm at (7,3). I move left to (6,3). Then, I move up to (6,4) and eat the apple.\n\nNow, my snake has grown, so my tail is still at (7,3).\n\nIf I move again, say to (6,5), my tail will stay at (7,3) until the entire snake has moved past it.\n\nBut perhaps in this game, it's simpler: when you eat an apple, your snake grows, and your tail remains in place until the rest of the snake moves.\n\nBut for now, since I'm only planning one move ahead, I just need to make sure that I don't move back"

(4,6): |4-7| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,4) with a distance of 1, which is directly to my left.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. The apple is right next to me at (6,4). I can reach it by moving left.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe. Let's check if there's any obstacle there.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, at (6,4), there's an apple, and at (7,4), there's my head.\n\nMoving left to (6,4) should be safe because there's no other snake there, and it's within the board boundaries.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), my snake will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nI need to plan my next moves after eating this apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), I can consider which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (6,4) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apple from (6,4) is (4,6) with a distance of 4.\n\nAlternatively, (8,1) is at distance 5.\n\nI should consider which one to go for next.\n\nBut perhaps I should focus on just getting the closest apple first, which is (6,4), and then decide afterwards.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the other snake's position and potential movements.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,8), and it's possible it will move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to make sure that my path to the apple doesn't lead me into the path of the other snake.\n\nLooking at the board, snake 1 is at (4,8), and the apple at (4,6) is directly below it.\n\nSo, snake 1 might go down to eat the apple at (4,6).\n\nIf that's the case, and I go to (6,4), then I need to make sure that I don't cross paths with snake 1.\n\nBut right now, snake 1 is at (4,8), and I'm at (7,4). There's some distance between us.\n\nI think the immediate priority is to eat the closest apple at (6,4).\n\nAfter eating that, I can consider moving towards (4,6), but I need to be cautious of snake 1.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (8,1), which is farther but might be safer.\n\nBut, since (4,6) is closer, maybe I can get there before snake 1.\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,8), and the apple at (4,6) is two steps down.\n\nIf snake 1 moves down twice, it can reach (4,6).\n\nI'm at (7,4), and after eating (6,4), I can move towards (4,6) in four steps.\n\nSo, snake 1 might reach (4,6) before me if it moves directly there.\n\nTherefore, perhaps going for (8,1) would be a better choice in the long run.\n\nBut, for now, I'll stick with going for the closest apple at (6,4).\n\nAfter eating that, I'll have to decide whether to go for (4,6) or (8,1).\n\nPerhaps I'll cross that bridge when I get there.\n\nFor now, my immediate move is to go left to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nI need to make sure that after eating the apple, my tail extends, so I have to ensure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut since I'm only moving left once to eat the apple, and then planning to move up or down afterwards, I should be fine.\n\nSo, my decision for this turn is to move left to (6,4).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

Wait, no, the board state shows:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, the apple is at (6,4), and I'm at (7,4). So, to eat that apple, I need to move left to (6,4).\n\nWait, but in the board state, it's shown as (7,4) for my position, but in the initial information, it's (6,4). There's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me double-check the initial information:\n\n\"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (6,4)\"\n\nBut in the board state, it shows:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, perhaps there's a mistake in the board state or the initial position.\n\nAssuming the initial position is correct, I'm at (6,4), and there's an apple at (6,4). Wait, that can't be, because if I'm at (6,4) and there's an apple there, I should have already eaten it.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (6,4), and I need to move to (6,4) to eat it.\n\nBut if I'm already at (6,4), then moving to (6,4) wouldn't make sense. Maybe the apple is at (7,4), where I am now.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify the positions.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\n- Row 4: positions (0,4) to (9,4)\n\n- Column 4: positions (0,4) to (0,9)\n\nWait, actually, the board is displayed with rows and columns, but I need to make sure I'm interpreting the coordinates correctly.\n\nIn the board state:\n\n- Row 9: positions (0,9) to (9,9)\n\n- Row 8: positions (0,8) to (9,8)\n\n...\n\n- Row 0: positions (0,0) to (9,0)\n\nAnd columns are from 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my position at (6,4) means column 6, row 4.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (8,9) is column 8, row 9.\n\nGiven that, in the board state, it shows:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, at (6,4), there's an apple, and at (7,4), there's my head.\n\nTherefore, to eat the apple at (6,4), I need to move left to (6,4).\n\nWait, but I'm already at (7,4), and the apple is at (6,4). So, moving left to (6,4) should be safe, as there's an apple there and no other snake.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe and that I don't collide with anything.\n\nLooking at the board, moving left from (7,4) to (6,4) is fine, as there's only the apple there.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I need to plan my next moves.\n\nLooking at the distances to other apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- (2,8): |2-6| + |8-4| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6) with a distance of 4.\n\nBut considering that snake 1 is at (4,7), which is close to (4,6), I need to be cautious.\n\nSnake 1 might move towards (4,6) as well.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider going for (8,1), which is at a distance of 5.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (4,6), but I need to see if I can get there before snake 1.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,7), and (4,6) is directly below it.\n\nIf snake 1 moves down, it can reach (4,6) before I can get there from (6,4).\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (8,1) would be a safer choice.\n\nBut (8,1) is at a distance of 5, while (4,6) is at 4.\n\nWait, but after eating the apple at (6,4), I can calculate the path.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, move left to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, from (6,4), I can consider moving towards (4,6) or (8,1).\n\nLet's calculate the steps:\n\nTo (4,6):\n\n- From (6,4) to (4,6): move left twice and up twice.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\n- From (6,4) to (8,1): move right twice and down three times.\n\nSo, to (4,6):\n\n1. Left to (5,4)\n\n2. Left to (4,4)\n\n3. Up to (4,5)\n\n4. Up to (4,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\n1. Right to (7,4)\n\n2. Right to (8,4)\n\n3. Down to (8,3)\n\n4. Down to (8,2)\n\n5. Down to (8,1)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nSo, going to (4,6) is faster.\n\nBut, as I mentioned earlier, snake 1 is at (4,7), and it can reach (4,6) in two moves:\n\n1. Down to (4,6)\n\nSo, if I go to (4,6) in four moves, snake 1 can reach there in two moves.\n\nTherefore, snake 1 will get to (4,6) before me.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for (8,1) instead.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to block snake 1's path to (4,6), but that might not be feasible given the distances.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (8,9), which is farther, but perhaps safer.\n\nBut it's at a distance of 7, which is quite far, and there might be other snakes moving towards it.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (8,1) is a better choice.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,4), I should head towards (8,1).\n\nBut first things first, I need to move left to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, from (6,4), I'll plan to go to (8,1).\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path is clear and that I don't run into snake 1 or any walls.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake.

(2,8): |2-5| + |8-4| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6) with a distance of 3.\n\nBut I need to consider the position of the other snake. Snake 1 is at (3,7). If I go towards (4,6), I might cross paths with snake 1.\n\nLet me think about the path to (4,6):\n\nFrom (5,4):\n\n- Up to (5,5)\n\n- Left to (4,5)\n\n- Down to (4,6)\n\nThat's three moves.\n\nMeanwhile, snake 1 is at (3,7). If it moves down to (3,6), then to (3,5), and then to (4,5) or (4,6), it might reach the apple first.\n\nI need to consider if it's worth risking going for (4,6) or choosing a different apple that's less contested.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (8,1), which is at a distance of 6.\n\nPath to (8,1):\n\nFrom (5,4):\n\n- Right to (6,4)\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\nThat's six moves.\n\nSnake 1 would have to make its way down from (3,7) to (8,1), which would take more than six moves, so I might be safer going for (8,1).\n\nBut it's farther, and I might miss out on closer apples.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,8) is at a distance of 7, which is even farther.\n\nThe apple at (8,9) is at a distance of 8, which is the farthest.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider going for (4,6), despite the competition from snake 1, because it's closer.\n\nBut I need to make sure I can get there before snake 1.\n\nLet me think about the possible moves of snake 1.\n\nSnake 1 is at (3,7). If it moves down to (3,6), then (3,5), then (4,5), and then (4,6), it would take four moves to reach (4,6).\n\nMeanwhile, I can reach (4,6) in three moves, as I planned earlier.\n\nSo, if I move faster, I can reach (4,6) before snake 1.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path is clear and that I don't run into any walls or myself.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating the apple at (4,6), I will grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver afterward.\n\nLet me think about my next move.\n\nFirst, I need to move towards (4,6).\n\nFrom (5,4), the best direction is left to (4,4), then up to (4,5), and then up to (4,6).\n\nSo, for my immediate next move, I should move left to (4,4).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that at (4,4), there shouldn't be any obstacles.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I don't turn back into my own body.\n\nSince this is the first move, my body is just the head at (5,4), so no risk there.\n\nTherefore, moving left to (4,4) seems safe.\n\nAfter that, I can plan to move up to (4,5), and then to (4,6).\n\nBut I need to make sure that snake 1 doesn't block my path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (8,1), which is less contested, even though it's farther.\n\nBut considering the distances, going for (4,6) is quicker, and I have a higher chance of getting it before snake 1.\n\nSo, I think I'll go for (4,6).\n\nTherefore, my immediate move should be left to (4,4).\n\nAlright, I decide to move left.\n\n**Final Move: LEFT**"

There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (6,4), (8,1), and (4,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,8), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: A (at 8,9), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 0,9)\n\nRow 8: dot, dot, dot, dot, 1 (snake 1 at 4,8), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 7: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 6: dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 4,6), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 5: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 4: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 6,4), dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 3: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 2: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, 2 (my snake at 7,2), dot, dot\n\nRow 1: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 8,1), dot\n\nRow 0: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nOkay, so I'm at (7,2), which is in row 2, column 7. I need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me list the apples:\n\n1. (8,9)\n\n2. (0,9)\n\n3. (6,4)\n\n4. (8,1)\n\n5. (4,6)\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Maybe the closest one to minimize the moves.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n1. To (8,9): |8-7| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n2. To (0,9): |0-7| + |9-2| = 7 + 7 = 14\n\n3. To (6,4): |6-7| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n4. To (8,1): |8-7| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n5. To (4,6): |4-7| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,1) with a distance of 2, followed by (6,4) at 3, then (4,6) at 7, (8,9) at 8, and (0,9) at 14.\n\nMaybe I should go for the closest apple at (8,1). But I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLet's see: from (7,2), I can move right to (8,2), then down to (8,1), which is the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any snakes or walls in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, at (8,2), it's dot, and at (8,1), it's apple. So, it's clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the other snake at (4,8). It's pretty far away, and it doesn't have any body parts, so it's less of a concern for now.\n\nSo, my plan is to move right to (8,2), then down to (8,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that moving right to (8,2) is safe. Let's check the surroundings.\n\nAt (8,2), it's dot, which is fine. Then moving down to (8,1), which is the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I will grow, so my tail will extend. But since it's just one move, I don't need to worry about hitting my own tail yet.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move right to (8,2).\n\nBut, I should also think about the next move. After moving right to (8,2), I will need to move down to (8,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that moving down from (8,2) is safe. Let's see:\n\nAt (8,1), it's the apple, which is fine. After eating it, I grow, so my tail extends.\n\nBut, I need to plan further ahead. After eating the apple at (8,1), what's my next target?\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (6,4), (4,6), (8,9), (0,9).\n\nThe closest one from (8,1) would be (8,9), which is up 8 units. But there might be better options.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (6,4), which is left 2 and up 3 from (8,1).\n\nLet me calculate the distances from (8,1):\n\n- (6,4): |6-8| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-8| + |6-1| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n- (8,9): |8-8| + |9-1| = 0 + 8 = 8\n\n- (0,9): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16\n\nSo, the closest is (6,4) at 5 units.\n\nSo, after eating (8,1), I should head towards (6,4).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake or create a situation where I box myself in.\n\nLooking at the board, from (8,1), moving left to (7,1), then (6,1), then up to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to ensure that the path is clear.\n\nAt (7,1): dot\n\nAt (6,1): dot\n\nAt (6,2): dot\n\nAt (6,3): dot\n\nAt (6,4): apple\n\nSo, it seems clear.\n\nBut, I need to consider the growth of my snake. After eating the first apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail later on.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated for just one move.\n\nMaybe I should simplify and just focus on getting to the closest apple, which is (8,1), and worry about the rest later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for a different apple that might be easier or safer.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6,4), which is another close one with a distance of 3 from my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then up to (6,4).\n\nBut that's 2 moves away, whereas the apple at (8,1) is only 2 moves away as well.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider which path is less likely to encounter the other snake.\n\nThe other snake is at (4,8), and it's not moving yet, as per the information provided.\n\nBut in reality, snakes can move, so I need to anticipate possible movements.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the other snake's direction or intelligence, I'll assume it moves randomly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps sticking to the path towards (8,1) is safer, as it's on the edge of the board, and I can avoid the center where the other snake might be.\n\nBut, after eating (8,1), I need to be careful not to get boxed in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (6,4) first.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nOption 1: Go to (8,1)\n\n- Move right to (8,2)\n\n- Move down to (8,1)\n\n- Eat apple, grow\n\n- Move left to (7,1)\n\n- Move left to (6,1)\n\n- Move up to (6,2)\n\n- Move up to (6,3)\n\n- Move up to (6,4)\n\nThat's 8 moves in total.\n\nOption 2: Go directly to (6,4)\n\n- Move left to (6,2)\n\n- Move up to (6,3)\n\n- Move up to (6,4)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nBut, in Option 1, I eat one apple"

Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences in x and y coordinates, which corresponds directly to the number of moves if you can move in the four cardinal directions.\n\nSo, to (6,4), it's 1 left and 1 up, total 2 moves.\n\nTo (8,1), it's 1 right and 2 down, total 3 moves.\n\nSo, (6,4) is closer in terms of moves.\n\nBut, I should also consider the position of the other snake.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,9), and it's possible it will move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to make sure that the path to the apple doesn't lead me into the path of the other snake.\n\nLet me see where the other snake is.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,9), and there are no body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to anticipate where it might go.\n\nLooking at the apples, from its position at (4,9), the closest apple is at (0,9), which is 4 units away (Manhattan distance 4), or (8,9), which is 4 units away as well.\n\nAlternatively, (4,6) is 3 units down.\n\nSo, it might go towards (4,6) first.\n\nBut, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for (6,4), which is closer and not directly in the path of the other snake.\n\nLet me plan the path to (6,4):\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n- Left to (6,3)\n\n- Up to (6,4)\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), I will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (6,4) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest is (4,6) at 4 units.\n\nFrom (6,4), to (4,6):\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\n- Up to (4,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (8,1), which is 5 units away:\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nSo, (4,6) is closer.\n\nBut, I need to consider the position of the other snake.\n\nIf snake 1 goes towards (4,6), I might run into it.\n\nAlternatively, if I go towards (8,1), it's farther, but perhaps safer.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just focus on the closest apple, which is (6,4), and worry about the next one later.\n\nLet me proceed with that plan.\n\nSo, first move: left to (6,3).\n\nThen, up to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for now, just planning the first move.\n\nSo, moving left to (6,3).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, at (6,3), it's empty, as per the board state provided.\n\nSo, it's safe to move there.\n\nThen, next move would be up to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow, so my tail will be at (7,3), where I was previously.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto (7,3).\n\nBut, since I'm moving left to (6,3), and then up to (6,4), and then planning to move towards (4,6), I should be fine.\n\nWait, no. After eating the apple at (6,4), my tail is at (6,3), because that's where I came from.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, the tail extends in the direction you came from.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,3) to (6,3), then to (6,4), my tail will still be at (7,3).\n\nWait, no, in some Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows by one segment, so the tail stays where it was before you moved.\n\nWait, I need to clarify how the tail works in this game.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, your snake grows, meaning that your tail stays in place until the rest of your snake moves.\n\nSo, in this case, when I eat the apple at (6,4), my tail remains at (6,3), and as I continue moving, the tail stays there until the rest of the snake moves forward.\n\nWait, actually, in classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail stays in place until the rest of the snake moves past it.\n\nBut in this game, since it's turn-based, and we're making one move at a time, I need to understand how the tail moves.\n\nAssuming that the tail follows the head's movements, but with a delay equal to the length of the snake.\n\nSince I just ate an apple, my snake has grown by one unit, so the tail remains where it was in the previous turn.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me simplify it.\n\nSuppose I'm at (7,3). I move left to (6,3). Then, I move up to (6,4) and eat the apple.\n\nNow, my snake has grown, so my tail is still at (7,3).\n\nIf I move again, say to (6,5), my tail will stay at (7,3) until the entire snake has moved past it.\n\nBut perhaps in this game, it's simpler: when you eat an apple, your snake grows, and your tail remains in place until the rest of the snake moves.\n\nBut for now, since I'm only planning one move ahead, I just need to make sure that I don't move back"

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (6,4), (8,1), and (4,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,8), but it doesn't have any body parts yet, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right. My goal is to eat apples and get points, while avoiding walls, other snakes, and myself.\n\nLet me visualize the board. Row 9 is the top row, and row 0 is the bottom row. Column 0 is the leftmost column, and column 9 is the rightmost.\n\nSo, I'm at (7,4), which is row 4, column 7.\n\nLet me list the apples and their distances from my current position using Manhattan distance.\n\n1. (8,9): |8-7| + |9-4| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n2. (0,9): |0-7| + |9-4| = 7 + 5 = 12\n\n3. (6,4): |6-7| + |4-4| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n4. (8,1): |8-7| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n5. (4,6): |4-7| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,4) with a distance of 1, which is directly to my left.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. The apple is right next to me at (6,4). I can reach it by moving left.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe. Let's check if there's any obstacle there.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, at (6,4), there's an apple, and at (7,4), there's my head.\n\nMoving left to (6,4) should be safe because there's no other snake there, and it's within the board boundaries.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), my snake will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nI need to plan my next moves after eating this apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), I can consider which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (6,4) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apple from (6,4) is (4,6) with a distance of 4.\n\nAlternatively, (8,1) is at distance 5.\n\nI should consider which one to go for next.\n\nBut perhaps I should focus on just getting the closest apple first, which is (6,4), and then decide afterwards.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the other snake's position and potential movements.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,8), and it's possible it will move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to make sure that my path to the apple doesn't lead me into the path of the other snake.\n\nLooking at the board, snake 1 is at (4,8), and the apple at (4,6) is directly below it.\n\nSo, snake 1 might go down to eat the apple at (4,6).\n\nIf that's the case, and I go to (6,4), then I need to make sure that I don't cross paths with snake 1.\n\nBut right now, snake 1 is at (4,8), and I'm at (7,4). There's some distance between us.\n\nI think the immediate priority is to eat the closest apple at (6,4).\n\nAfter eating that, I can consider moving towards (4,6), but I need to be cautious of snake 1.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (8,1), which is farther but might be safer.\n\nBut, since (4,6) is closer, maybe I can get there before snake 1.\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,8), and the apple at (4,6) is two steps down.\n\nIf snake 1 moves down twice, it can reach (4,6).\n\nI'm at (7,4), and after eating (6,4), I can move towards (4,6) in four steps.\n\nSo, snake 1 might reach (4,6) before me if it moves directly there.\n\nTherefore, perhaps going for (8,1) would be a better choice in the long run.\n\nBut, for now, I'll stick with going for the closest apple at (6,4).\n\nAfter eating that, I'll have to decide whether to go for (4,6) or (8,1).\n\nPerhaps I'll cross that bridge when I get there.\n\nFor now, my immediate move is to go left to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nI need to make sure that after eating the apple, my tail extends, so I have to ensure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut since I'm only moving left once to eat the apple, and then planning to move up or down afterwards, I should be fine.\n\nSo, my decision for this turn is to move left to (6,4).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

Wait, no, the board state shows:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, the apple is at (6,4), and I'm at (7,4). So, to eat that apple, I need to move left to (6,4).\n\nWait, but in the board state, it's shown as (7,4) for my position, but in the initial information, it's (6,4). There's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me double-check the initial information:\n\n\"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (6,4)\"\n\nBut in the board state, it shows:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, perhaps there's a mistake in the board state or the initial position.\n\nAssuming the initial position is correct, I'm at (6,4), and there's an apple at (6,4). Wait, that can't be, because if I'm at (6,4) and there's an apple there, I should have already eaten it.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (6,4), and I need to move to (6,4) to eat it.\n\nBut if I'm already at (6,4), then moving to (6,4) wouldn't make sense. Maybe the apple is at (7,4), where I am now.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify the positions.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\n- Row 4: positions (0,4) to (9,4)\n\n- Column 4: positions (0,4) to (0,9)\n\nWait, actually, the board is displayed with rows and columns, but I need to make sure I'm interpreting the coordinates correctly.\n\nIn the board state:\n\n- Row 9: positions (0,9) to (9,9)\n\n- Row 8: positions (0,8) to (9,8)\n\n...\n\n- Row 0: positions (0,0) to (9,0)\n\nAnd columns are from 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my position at (6,4) means column 6, row 4.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (8,9) is column 8, row 9.\n\nGiven that, in the board state, it shows:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, at (6,4), there's an apple, and at (7,4), there's my head.\n\nTherefore, to eat the apple at (6,4), I need to move left to (6,4).\n\nWait, but I'm already at (7,4), and the apple is at (6,4). So, moving left to (6,4) should be safe, as there's an apple there and no other snake.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe and that I don't collide with anything.\n\nLooking at the board, moving left from (7,4) to (6,4) is fine, as there's only the apple there.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I need to plan my next moves.\n\nLooking at the distances to other apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- (2,8): |2-6| + |8-4| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6) with a distance of 4.\n\nBut considering that snake 1 is at (4,7), which is close to (4,6), I need to be cautious.\n\nSnake 1 might move towards (4,6) as well.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider going for (8,1), which is at a distance of 5.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (4,6), but I need to see if I can get there before snake 1.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,7), and (4,6) is directly below it.\n\nIf snake 1 moves down, it can reach (4,6) before I can get there from (6,4).\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (8,1) would be a safer choice.\n\nBut (8,1) is at a distance of 5, while (4,6) is at 4.\n\nWait, but after eating the apple at (6,4), I can calculate the path.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, move left to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, from (6,4), I can consider moving towards (4,6) or (8,1).\n\nLet's calculate the steps:\n\nTo (4,6):\n\n- From (6,4) to (4,6): move left twice and up twice.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\n- From (6,4) to (8,1): move right twice and down three times.\n\nSo, to (4,6):\n\n1. Left to (5,4)\n\n2. Left to (4,4)\n\n3. Up to (4,5)\n\n4. Up to (4,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\n1. Right to (7,4)\n\n2. Right to (8,4)\n\n3. Down to (8,3)\n\n4. Down to (8,2)\n\n5. Down to (8,1)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nSo, going to (4,6) is faster.\n\nBut, as I mentioned earlier, snake 1 is at (4,7), and it can reach (4,6) in two moves:\n\n1. Down to (4,6)\n\nSo, if I go to (4,6) in four moves, snake 1 can reach there in two moves.\n\nTherefore, snake 1 will get to (4,6) before me.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for (8,1) instead.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to block snake 1's path to (4,6), but that might not be feasible given the distances.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (8,9), which is farther, but perhaps safer.\n\nBut it's at a distance of 7, which is quite far, and there might be other snakes moving towards it.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (8,1) is a better choice.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,4), I should head towards (8,1).\n\nBut first things first, I need to move left to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, from (6,4), I'll plan to go to (8,1).\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path is clear and that I don't run into snake 1 or any walls.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake.

If it moves down to (3,6), then (3,5), then (4,5), and then (4,6), it would take four moves to reach (4,6).\n\nMeanwhile, I can reach (4,6) in three moves, as I planned earlier.\n\nSo, if I move faster, I can reach (4,6) before snake 1.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path is clear and that I don't run into any walls or myself.\n\nAlso, I need to consider that after eating the apple at (4,6), I will grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to maneuver afterward.\n\nLet me think about my next move.\n\nFirst, I need to move towards (4,6).\n\nFrom (5,4), the best direction is left to (4,4), then up to (4,5), and then up to (4,6).\n\nSo, for my immediate next move, I should move left to (4,4).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, I see that at (4,4), there shouldn't be any obstacles.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that I don't turn back into my own body.\n\nSince this is the first move, my body is just the head at (5,4), so no risk there.\n\nTherefore, moving left to (4,4) seems safe.\n\nAfter that, I can plan to move up to (4,5), and then to (4,6).\n\nBut I need to make sure that snake 1 doesn't block my path.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apple at (8,1), which is less contested, even though it's farther.\n\nBut considering the distances, going for (4,6) is quicker, and I have a higher chance of getting it before snake 1.\n\nSo, I think I'll go for (4,6).\n\nTherefore, my immediate move should be left to (4,4).\n\nAlright, I decide to move left.\n\n**Final Move: LEFT**"

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (8,1), (4,6), and (2,8).

I need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right.\n\nLet me visualize the board. Row 9 is the top row, and row 0 is the bottom row. Column 0 is the leftmost column, and column 9 is the rightmost.\n\nSo, I'm at (4,4), which is row 4, column 4.\n\nLet me list the apples and their distances from my current position using Manhattan distance.\n\n1. (8,9): |8-4| + |9-4| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n2. (0,9): |0-4| + |9-4| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n3. (8,1): |8-4| + |1-4| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n4. (4,6): |4-4| + |6-4| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\n5. (2,8): |2-4| + |8-4| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6) with a distance of 2.\n\nBut I need to consider the position of the other snake. Snake 1 is at (3,8).

There don't seem to be any obstacles there.\n\nAlso, after eating the apple at (4,6), I will grow, so I need to ensure that I have space to continue moving without hitting myself.\n\nSince it's a small distance, and snake 1 is farther away, I think it's safe to go for (4,6).\n\nTherefore, my immediate move should be up to (4,5).\n\nAlright, I decide to move up.\n\n**Final Move: UP**"

Wait, in the last move information, it said I was at (4,5), but in the board state, it shows snake 2 at (4,5). So, I need to confirm my current position. Looking back, in the last move, I moved up from (4,4) to (4,5). So, now I'm at (4,5).\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (8,1), (4,6), and (5,7). There's also another snake, number 1, at (2,8), with its body at (3,8).\n\nLet me first list out all the positions:\n\n- My head: (4,5)\n\n- Enemy snake head: (2,8), body: (3,8)\n\n- Apples: (8,9), (0,9), (8,1), (4,6), (5,7)\n\nI need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions around me and see which moves are safe.\n\nLet's look at each possible move:\n\n1. Up: from (4,5) to (4,6)\n\n2. Down: from (4,5) to (4,4)\n\n3. Left: from (4,5) to (3,5)\n\n4. Right: from (4,5) to (5,5)\n\nI need to check for each direction:\n\n- Is the new position within bounds? (0 <= x < 10, 0 <= y < 10)\n\n- Is the new position not occupied by another snake (including myself) or a wall?\n\n- Is there an apple there? If yes, moving there will make me grow.\n\nAlso, I need to think about future moves to avoid trapping myself.\n\nLet's evaluate each direction:\n\n1. Up: (4,6)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? No, according to the board state.\n\n- Is there an apple there? Yes, at (4,6).\n\nSo, moving up would mean I eat the apple and grow longer.\n\n2. Down: (4,4)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? No.\n\n- Is there an apple there? No.\n\nMoving down is safe for now, but there's no apple there.\n\n3. Left: (3,5)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? Let's see. Enemy snake is at (2,8) and (3,8), so its head and body. Position (3,5) is empty.\n\n- Is there an apple there? No.\n\nSo, moving left is safe.\n\n4. Right: (5,5)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? No.\n\n- Is there an apple there? No.\n\nMoving right is also safe.\n\nNow, among the safe moves, moving up would get me an apple, which is beneficial.\n\nBut I should consider the position after eating the apple.\n\nIf I move up to (4,6), I eat the apple and grow. My tail will stay where it is unless I don't move it, but in Snake, typically, moving to a new position shifts the entire body forward, and the tail moves accordingly.\n\nWait, in this game, when you move, your entire body shifts forward, and the tail moves to where the second-to-last segment was, and so on, provided you don't eat an apple. If you eat an apple, your tail stays in place, effectively making your snake longer.\n\nBut I need to confirm the mechanics. From the rules:\n\n1. If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\n2. If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\n3. The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nSo, when I eat an apple, I grow, meaning my length increases by one, and I gain a point.\n\nTherefore, moving to (4,6) would make me eat the apple, and my tail would not move back, effectively extending my snake.\n\nBut I need to plan my next moves to ensure I don't immediately run into my own body.\n\nWait, but in Snake, typically, when you eat an apple, your tail stays where it is for that move, and then on the next move, it moves as usual, but since you've grown, the tail remains extended.\n\nBut I need to think carefully.\n\nLet's assume that after eating the apple, my snake becomes longer by one segment.\n\nSo, if I'm currently at (4,5), and I move up to (4,6), eating the apple, my tail remains where it was, but since this is the first move, I don't have a body yet, so my tail is just my previous head position, (4,5).\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, you have a body that follows the head. So, if I'm just the head at (4,5), and I move to (4,6), eating an apple, my body doesn't immediately follow; instead, my tail remains at (4,5), and my head is now at (4,6), with the apple consumed.\n\nBut in the next move, if I move again, my tail would move forward.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of a body list.\n\nLet's simplify: suppose I'm currently just a head at (4,5). After eating the apple at (4,6), my snake becomes longer by one segment.\n\nSo, my body would now be:\n\n- Head: (4,6)\n\n- Tail: (4,5)\n\nThen, in the next move, if I move up to (4,7), my body becomes:\n\n- Head: (4,7)\n\n- Body: (4,6)\n\n- Tail: (4,5)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, after eating the apple, my snake has two segments: head and tail.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that in my future moves, I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut for the immediate move, moving up to (4,6) is safe, as it's an apple, and I'll grow.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after that.\n\nIf I move up to (4,6), then in the next move, I can choose to move up to (4,7), down to (4,5), left to (3,6), or right to (5,6).\n\nI need to ensure that whichever direction I choose next doesn't lead me to collide with my own tail or other snakes.\n\nGiven that, moving up to (4,7) seems safe, as long as there are no obstacles there.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (3,6) or right to (5,6) might also be safe, depending on what's there.\n\nBut I need to plan ahead.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down to (4,5), which is where my tail is after eating the apple.\n\nBut in Snake, moving back to where your tail is typically doesn't cause a collision, because by the time you move there, your tail has moved forward.\n\nWait, no. In Snake, if you move back to where your tail was, by the time you get there, your tail has moved, so you don't collide with it.\n\nBut in this game, since it's turn-based, and moves are simultaneous, I need to be careful.\n\nWait, actually, in most Snake games, moves are based on a queue: your head moves first, and then the body follows in the next turns.\n\nBut to simplify, perhaps I should consider that after eating the apple, my snake is now two segments: head at (4,6), tail at (4,5).\n\nThen, if I move up to (4,7), my tail moves to (4,6).\n\nIf I then move up again to (4,8), my tail moves to (4,7), and so on.\n\nSo, as long as I don't make a U-turn and go back to (4,5) before my tail has moved out of that position, I should be safe.\n\nBut in this case, since my tail is at (4,5) after eating the apple, and if I move up to (4,7) next, my tail moves to (4,6).\n\nThen, if I move up to (4,8), my tail moves to (4,7).\n\nSo, I'm safe.\n\nTherefore, moving up to (4,6) seems like a good idea, as it gets me an apple and allows me to continue moving up without immediately colliding with my own tail.\n\nBut I should also consider the position of the other snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,8), with body at (3,8).\n\nIf I move up to (4,6), and then continue moving up to (4,7), (4,8), and so on, I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't moving towards me.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake's position, it's at (2,8), with body at (3,8).\n\nIf it moves right to (4,8), then to (5,8), and so on, it might not immediately pose a threat to me.\n\nBut I need to consider its possible moves.\n\nAlternatively, if it moves"

There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (6,4), (8,1), and (4,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,8), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: A (at 8,9), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 0,9)\n\nRow 8: dot, dot, dot, dot, 1 (snake 1 at 4,8), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 7: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 6: dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 4,6), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 5: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 4: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 6,4), dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 3: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 2: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, 2 (my snake at 7,2), dot, dot\n\nRow 1: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 8,1), dot\n\nRow 0: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nOkay, so I'm at (7,2), which is in row 2, column 7. I need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me list the apples:\n\n1. (8,9)\n\n2. (0,9)\n\n3. (6,4)\n\n4. (8,1)\n\n5. (4,6)\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Maybe the closest one to minimize the moves.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n1. To (8,9): |8-7| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n2. To (0,9): |0-7| + |9-2| = 7 + 7 = 14\n\n3. To (6,4): |6-7| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n4. To (8,1): |8-7| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n5. To (4,6): |4-7| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,1) with a distance of 2, followed by (6,4) at 3, then (4,6) at 7, (8,9) at 8, and (0,9) at 14.\n\nMaybe I should go for the closest apple at (8,1). But I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLet's see: from (7,2), I can move right to (8,2), then down to (8,1), which is the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any snakes or walls in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, at (8,2), it's dot, and at (8,1), it's apple. So, it's clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the other snake at (4,8). It's pretty far away, and it doesn't have any body parts, so it's less of a concern for now.\n\nSo, my plan is to move right to (8,2), then down to (8,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that moving right to (8,2) is safe. Let's check the surroundings.\n\nAt (8,2), it's dot, which is fine. Then moving down to (8,1), which is the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I will grow, so my tail will extend. But since it's just one move, I don't need to worry about hitting my own tail yet.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move right to (8,2).\n\nBut, I should also think about the next move. After moving right to (8,2), I will need to move down to (8,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that moving down from (8,2) is safe. Let's see:\n\nAt (8,1), it's the apple, which is fine. After eating it, I grow, so my tail extends.\n\nBut, I need to plan further ahead. After eating the apple at (8,1), what's my next target?\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (6,4), (4,6), (8,9), (0,9).\n\nThe closest one from (8,1) would be (8,9), which is up 8 units. But there might be better options.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (6,4), which is left 2 and up 3 from (8,1).\n\nLet me calculate the distances from (8,1):\n\n- (6,4): |6-8| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-8| + |6-1| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n- (8,9): |8-8| + |9-1| = 0 + 8 = 8\n\n- (0,9): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16\n\nSo, the closest is (6,4) at 5 units.\n\nSo, after eating (8,1), I should head towards (6,4).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake or create a situation where I box myself in.\n\nLooking at the board, from (8,1), moving left to (7,1), then (6,1), then up to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to ensure that the path is clear.\n\nAt (7,1): dot\n\nAt (6,1): dot\n\nAt (6,2): dot\n\nAt (6,3): dot\n\nAt (6,4): apple\n\nSo, it seems clear.\n\nBut, I need to consider the growth of my snake. After eating the first apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail later on.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated for just one move.\n\nMaybe I should simplify and just focus on getting to the closest apple, which is (8,1), and worry about the rest later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for a different apple that might be easier or safer.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6,4), which is another close one with a distance of 3 from my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then up to (6,4).\n\nBut that's 2 moves away, whereas the apple at (8,1) is only 2 moves away as well.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider which path is less likely to encounter the other snake.\n\nThe other snake is at (4,8), and it's not moving yet, as per the information provided.\n\nBut in reality, snakes can move, so I need to anticipate possible movements.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the other snake's direction or intelligence, I'll assume it moves randomly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps sticking to the path towards (8,1) is safer, as it's on the edge of the board, and I can avoid the center where the other snake might be.\n\nBut, after eating (8,1), I need to be careful not to get boxed in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (6,4) first.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nOption 1: Go to (8,1)\n\n- Move right to (8,2)\n\n- Move down to (8,1)\n\n- Eat apple, grow\n\n- Move left to (7,1)\n\n- Move left to (6,1)\n\n- Move up to (6,2)\n\n- Move up to (6,3)\n\n- Move up to (6,4)\n\nThat's 8 moves in total.\n\nOption 2: Go directly to (6,4)\n\n- Move left to (6,2)\n\n- Move up to (6,3)\n\n- Move up to (6,4)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nBut, in Option 1, I eat one apple"

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (6,4), (8,1), and (4,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,9), but it doesn't have any body parts yet, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right. My goal is to eat apples and get points, while avoiding walls, other snakes, and myself.\n\nLet me visualize the board. Row 9 is the top row, and row 0 is the bottom row. Column 0 is the leftmost column, and column 9 is the rightmost.\n\nSo, I'm at (7,3), which is row 3, column 7.\n\nLet me list the apples and their distances from my current position using Manhattan distance.\n\n1. (8,9): |8-7| + |9-3| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n2. (0,9): |0-7| + |9-3| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n3. (6,4): |6-7| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n4. (8,1): |8-7| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n5. (4,6): |4-7| + |6-3| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,4) with a distance of 2, followed by (8,1) at distance 3.\n\nHmm, I need to decide which one to go for first. The closest one is (6,4), but (8,1) is also pretty close.\n\nLet me think about the paths.\n\nTo (6,4):\n\nFrom (7,3), I can move left to (6,3), then up to (6,4). That's two moves.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\nFrom (7,3), I can move right to (8,3), then down to (8,2), then down to (8,1). That's three moves.\n\nWait, is (8,1) really three moves away? Let's see:\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\nYes, that's three moves.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated the Manhattan distance to (8,1) as 3, but in terms of moves, it's actually three moves.\n\nWait, no. Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences in x and y coordinates, which corresponds directly to the number of moves if you can move in the four cardinal directions.\n\nSo, to (6,4), it's 1 left and 1 up, total 2 moves.\n\nTo (8,1), it's 1 right and 2 down, total 3 moves.\n\nSo, (6,4) is closer in terms of moves.\n\nBut, I should also consider the position of the other snake.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,9), and it's possible it will move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to make sure that the path to the apple doesn't lead me into the path of the other snake.\n\nLet me see where the other snake is.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,9), and there are no body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to anticipate where it might go.\n\nLooking at the apples, from its position at (4,9), the closest apple is at (0,9), which is 4 units away (Manhattan distance 4), or (8,9), which is 4 units away as well.\n\nAlternatively, (4,6) is 3 units down.\n\nSo, it might go towards (4,6) first.\n\nBut, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for (6,4), which is closer and not directly in the path of the other snake.\n\nLet me plan the path to (6,4):\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n- Left to (6,3)\n\n- Up to (6,4)\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), I will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (6,4) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest is (4,6) at 4 units.\n\nFrom (6,4), to (4,6):\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\n- Up to (4,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (8,1), which is 5 units away:\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nSo, (4,6) is closer.\n\nBut, I need to consider the position of the other snake.\n\nIf snake 1 goes towards (4,6), I might run into it.\n\nAlternatively, if I go towards (8,1), it's farther, but perhaps safer.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just focus on the closest apple, which is (6,4), and worry about the next one later.\n\nLet me proceed with that plan.\n\nSo, first move: left to (6,3).\n\nThen, up to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for now, just planning the first move.\n\nSo, moving left to (6,3).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, at (6,3), it's empty, as per the board state provided.\n\nSo, it's safe to move there.\n\nThen, next move would be up to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow, so my tail will be at (7,3), where I was previously.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto (7,3).\n\nBut, since I'm moving left to (6,3), and then up to (6,4), and then planning to move towards (4,6), I should be fine.\n\nWait, no. After eating the apple at (6,4), my tail is at (6,3), because that's where I came from.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, the tail extends in the direction you came from.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,3) to (6,3), then to (6,4), my tail will still be at (7,3).\n\nWait, no, in some Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows by one segment, so the tail stays where it was before you moved.\n\nWait, I need to clarify how the tail works in this game.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, your snake grows, meaning that your tail stays in place until the rest of your snake moves.\n\nSo, in this case, when I eat the apple at (6,4), my tail remains at (6,3), and as I continue moving, the tail stays there until the rest of the snake moves forward.\n\nWait, actually, in classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail stays in place until the rest of the snake moves past it.\n\nBut in this game, since it's turn-based, and we're making one move at a time, I need to understand how the tail moves.\n\nAssuming that the tail follows the head's movements, but with a delay equal to the length of the snake.\n\nSince I just ate an apple, my snake has grown by one unit, so the tail remains where it was in the previous turn.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me simplify it.\n\nSuppose I'm at (7,3). I move left to (6,3). Then, I move up to (6,4) and eat the apple.\n\nNow, my snake has grown, so my tail is still at (7,3).\n\nIf I move again, say to (6,5), my tail will stay at (7,3) until the entire snake has moved past it.\n\nBut perhaps in this game, it's simpler: when you eat an apple, your snake grows, and your tail remains in place until the rest of the snake moves.\n\nBut for now, since I'm only planning one move ahead, I just need to make sure that I don't move back"

So, moving left to (6,4) should be safe, as there's an apple there and no other snake.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe and that I don't collide with anything.\n\nLooking at the board, moving left from (7,4) to (6,4) is fine, as there's only the apple there.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I need to plan my next moves.\n\nLooking at the distances to other apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- (2,8): |2-6| + |8-4| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6) with a distance of 4.\n\nBut considering that snake 1 is at (4,7), which is close to (4,6), I need to be cautious.\n\nSnake 1 might move towards (4,6) as well.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider going for (8,1), which is at a distance of 5.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (4,6), but I need to see if I can get there before snake 1.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,7), and (4,6) is directly below it.\n\nIf snake 1 moves down, it can reach (4,6) before I can get there from (6,4).\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (8,1) would be a safer choice.\n\nBut (8,1) is at a distance of 5, while (4,6) is at 4.\n\nWait, but after eating the apple at (6,4), I can calculate the path.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, move left to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, from (6,4), I can consider moving towards (4,6) or (8,1).\n\nLet's calculate the steps:\n\nTo (4,6):\n\n- From (6,4) to (4,6): move left twice and up twice.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\n- From (6,4) to (8,1): move right twice and down three times.\n\nSo, to (4,6):\n\n1. Left to (5,4)\n\n2. Left to (4,4)\n\n3. Up to (4,5)\n\n4. Up to (4,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\n1. Right to (7,4)\n\n2. Right to (8,4)\n\n3. Down to (8,3)\n\n4. Down to (8,2)\n\n5. Down to (8,1)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nSo, going to (4,6) is faster.\n\nBut, as I mentioned earlier, snake 1 is at (4,7), and it can reach (4,6) in two moves:\n\n1. Down to (4,6)\n\nSo, if I go to (4,6) in four moves, snake 1 can reach there in two moves.\n\nTherefore, snake 1 will get to (4,6) before me.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for (8,1) instead.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to block snake 1's path to (4,6), but that might not be feasible given the distances.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (8,9), which is farther, but perhaps safer.\n\nBut it's at a distance of 7, which is quite far, and there might be other snakes moving towards it.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (8,1) is a better choice.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,4), I should head towards (8,1).\n\nBut first things first, I need to move left to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, from (6,4), I'll plan to go to (8,1).\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path is clear and that I don't run into snake 1 or any walls.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake.

Wait, in the last move information, it said I was at (4,5), but in the board state, it shows snake 2 at (4,5). So, I need to confirm my current position. Looking back, in the last move, I moved up from (4,4) to (4,5). So, now I'm at (4,5).\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (8,1), (4,6), and (5,7). There's also another snake, number 1, at (2,8), with its body at (3,8).\n\nLet me first list out all the positions:\n\n- My head: (4,5)\n\n- Enemy snake head: (2,8), body: (3,8)\n\n- Apples: (8,9), (0,9), (8,1), (4,6), (5,7)\n\nI need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions around me and see which moves are safe.\n\nLet's look at each possible move:\n\n1. Up: from (4,5) to (4,6)\n\n2. Down: from (4,5) to (4,4)\n\n3. Left: from (4,5) to (3,5)\n\n4. Right: from (4,5) to (5,5)\n\nI need to check for each direction:\n\n- Is the new position within bounds? (0 <= x < 10, 0 <= y < 10)\n\n- Is the new position not occupied by another snake (including myself) or a wall?\n\n- Is there an apple there? If yes, moving there will make me grow.\n\nAlso, I need to think about future moves to avoid trapping myself.\n\nLet's evaluate each direction:\n\n1. Up: (4,6)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? No, according to the board state.\n\n- Is there an apple there? Yes, at (4,6).\n\nSo, moving up would mean I eat the apple and grow longer.\n\n2. Down: (4,4)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? No.\n\n- Is there an apple there? No.\n\nMoving down is safe for now, but there's no apple there.\n\n3. Left: (3,5)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? Let's see. Enemy snake is at (2,8) and (3,8), so its head and body. Position (3,5) is empty.\n\n- Is there an apple there? No.\n\nSo, moving left is safe.\n\n4. Right: (5,5)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? No.\n\n- Is there an apple there? No.\n\nMoving right is also safe.\n\nNow, among the safe moves, moving up would get me an apple, which is beneficial.\n\nBut I should consider the position after eating the apple.\n\nIf I move up to (4,6), I eat the apple and grow. My tail will stay where it is unless I don't move it, but in Snake, typically, moving to a new position shifts the entire body forward, and the tail moves accordingly.\n\nWait, in this game, when you move, your entire body shifts forward, and the tail moves to where the second-to-last segment was, and so on, provided you don't eat an apple. If you eat an apple, your tail stays in place, effectively making your snake longer.\n\nBut I need to confirm the mechanics. From the rules:\n\n1. If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\n2. If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\n3. The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nSo, when I eat an apple, I grow, meaning my length increases by one, and I gain a point.\n\nTherefore, moving to (4,6) would make me eat the apple, and my tail would not move back, effectively extending my snake.\n\nBut I need to plan my next moves to ensure I don't immediately run into my own body.\n\nWait, but in Snake, typically, when you eat an apple, your tail stays where it is for that move, and then on the next move, it moves as usual, but since you've grown, the tail remains extended.\n\nBut I need to think carefully.\n\nLet's assume that after eating the apple, my snake becomes longer by one segment.\n\nSo, if I'm currently at (4,5), and I move up to (4,6), eating the apple, my tail remains where it was, but since this is the first move, I don't have a body yet, so my tail is just my previous head position, (4,5).\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, you have a body that follows the head. So, if I'm just the head at (4,5), and I move to (4,6), eating an apple, my body doesn't immediately follow; instead, my tail remains at (4,5), and my head is now at (4,6), with the apple consumed.\n\nBut in the next move, if I move again, my tail would move forward.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of a body list.\n\nLet's simplify: suppose I'm currently just a head at (4,5). After eating the apple at (4,6), my snake becomes longer by one segment.\n\nSo, my body would now be:\n\n- Head: (4,6)\n\n- Tail: (4,5)\n\nThen, in the next move, if I move up to (4,7), my body becomes:\n\n- Head: (4,7)\n\n- Body: (4,6)\n\n- Tail: (4,5)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, after eating the apple, my snake has two segments: head and tail.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that in my future moves, I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut for the immediate move, moving up to (4,6) is safe, as it's an apple, and I'll grow.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after that.\n\nIf I move up to (4,6), then in the next move, I can choose to move up to (4,7), down to (4,5), left to (3,6), or right to (5,6).\n\nI need to ensure that whichever direction I choose next doesn't lead me to collide with my own tail or other snakes.\n\nGiven that, moving up to (4,7) seems safe, as long as there are no obstacles there.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (3,6) or right to (5,6) might also be safe, depending on what's there.\n\nBut I need to plan ahead.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down to (4,5), which is where my tail is after eating the apple.\n\nBut in Snake, moving back to where your tail is typically doesn't cause a collision, because by the time you move there, your tail has moved forward.\n\nWait, no. In Snake, if you move back to where your tail was, by the time you get there, your tail has moved, so you don't collide with it.\n\nBut in this game, since it's turn-based, and moves are simultaneous, I need to be careful.\n\nWait, actually, in most Snake games, moves are based on a queue: your head moves first, and then the body follows in the next turns.\n\nBut to simplify, perhaps I should consider that after eating the apple, my snake is now two segments: head at (4,6), tail at (4,5).\n\nThen, if I move up to (4,7), my tail moves to (4,6).\n\nIf I then move up again to (4,8), my tail moves to (4,7), and so on.\n\nSo, as long as I don't make a U-turn and go back to (4,5) before my tail has moved out of that position, I should be safe.\n\nBut in this case, since my tail is at (4,5) after eating the apple, and if I move up to (4,7) next, my tail moves to (4,6).\n\nThen, if I move up to (4,8), my tail moves to (4,7).\n\nSo, I'm safe.\n\nTherefore, moving up to (4,6) seems like a good idea, as it gets me an apple and allows me to continue moving up without immediately colliding with my own tail.\n\nBut I should also consider the position of the other snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,8), with body at (3,8).\n\nIf I move up to (4,6), and then continue moving up to (4,7), (4,8), and so on, I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't moving towards me.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake's position, it's at (2,8), with body at (3,8).\n\nIf it moves right to (4,8), then to (5,8), and so on, it might not immediately pose a threat to me.\n\nBut I need to consider its possible moves.\n\nAlternatively, if it moves"

There's also another snake, number 1, at (2,9), with its body at (2,8).\n\nLet me first list out all the positions:\n\n- My head: (5,5)\n\n- Enemy snake head: (2,9), body: (2,8)\n\n- Apples: (8,9), (0,9), (8,1), (4,6), (5,7)\n\nI need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions around me and see which moves are safe.\n\nLet's look at each possible move:\n\n1. Up: from (5,5) to (5,6)\n\n2. Down: from (5,5) to (5,4)\n\n3. Left: from (5,5) to (4,5)\n\n4. Right: from (5,5) to (6,5)\n\nI need to check for each direction:\n\n- Is the new position within bounds? (0 <= x < 10, 0 <= y < 10)\n\n- Is the new position not occupied by another snake (including myself) or a wall?\n\n- Is there an apple there? If yes, moving there will make me grow.\n\nAlso, I need to think about future moves to avoid trapping myself.\n\nLet's evaluate each direction:\n\n1. Up: (5,6)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? No, according to the board state.\n\n- Is there an apple there? No.\n\nSo, moving up is safe, but there's no apple there.\n\n2. Down: (5,4)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? No.\n\n- Is there an apple there? No.\n\nMoving down is safe, but there's no apple there.\n\n3. Left: (4,5)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? Let's see. Enemy snake is at (2,9) and (2,8), so its head and body. Position (4,5) is empty.\n\n- Is there an apple there? No.\n\nSo, moving left is safe.\n\n4. Right: (6,5)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? No.\n\n- Is there an apple there? No.\n\nMoving right is also safe.\n\nNow, since none of the immediate moves lead to an apple, I need to think about which direction could potentially lead me to an apple soon.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (8,9): that's up and to the right.\n\n- (0,9): that's up and to the left.\n\n- (8,1): that's down and to the right.\n\n- (4,6): that's up a bit.\n\n- (5,7): that's up.\n\nAmong these, (5,7) is the closest, only two steps up from my current position.\n\nSo, perhaps I should consider moving up towards (5,7).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving up is safe in the short term.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 5: ... 2 ...\n\nRow 6: .....\n\nRow 7: ....A...\n\nSo, moving up to (5,6), then to (5,7) to eat the apple.\n\nI need to ensure that after eating the apple, I don't immediately run into a problem.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that the next move after that is also safe.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake's movement.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,9), with body at (2,8). It might move towards the apples or towards me, depending on its strategy.\n\nI should try to predict its movement.\n\nIf it moves down towards me, I need to avoid it.\n\nBut for now, it's relatively far away.\n\nSo, focusing on getting the apple at (5,7), I think moving up to (5,6) is a good first step.\n\nThen, next turn, I can move up again to (5,7) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will be longer, so I need to be careful not to collide with my own tail.\n\nBut for now, since I'm just the head, moving up to (5,6) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards another apple, but (5,7) is the closest.\n\nLet me think about the path to (5,7):\n\n- Current: (5,5)\n\n- Up: (5,6)\n\n- Up: (5,7) - apple\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will be:\n\n- Head: (5,7)\n\n- Tail: (5,6)\n\nThen, next move, if I move up to (5,8), my tail moves to (5,7).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't immediately surround myself.\n\nLooking at the board, there don't seem to be any immediate dangers in moving up to (5,6) and then to (5,7).\n\nSo, I think moving up is a safe and strategic move for now.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's movement and adjust my path if necessary.\n\nBut for this turn, moving up seems like the best choice.\n\n**Final Decision: UP**"

There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (6,4), (8,1), and (4,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,8), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: A (at 8,9), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 0,9)\n\nRow 8: dot, dot, dot, dot, 1 (snake 1 at 4,8), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 7: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 6: dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 4,6), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 5: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 4: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 6,4), dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 3: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 2: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, 2 (my snake at 7,2), dot, dot\n\nRow 1: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 8,1), dot\n\nRow 0: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nOkay, so I'm at (7,2), which is in row 2, column 7. I need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me list the apples:\n\n1. (8,9)\n\n2. (0,9)\n\n3. (6,4)\n\n4. (8,1)\n\n5. (4,6)\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Maybe the closest one to minimize the moves.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n1. To (8,9): |8-7| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n2. To (0,9): |0-7| + |9-2| = 7 + 7 = 14\n\n3. To (6,4): |6-7| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n4. To (8,1): |8-7| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n5. To (4,6): |4-7| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,1) with a distance of 2, followed by (6,4) at 3, then (4,6) at 7, (8,9) at 8, and (0,9) at 14.\n\nMaybe I should go for the closest apple at (8,1). But I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLet's see: from (7,2), I can move right to (8,2), then down to (8,1), which is the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any snakes or walls in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, at (8,2), it's dot, and at (8,1), it's apple. So, it's clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the other snake at (4,8). It's pretty far away, and it doesn't have any body parts, so it's less of a concern for now.\n\nSo, my plan is to move right to (8,2), then down to (8,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that moving right to (8,2) is safe. Let's check the surroundings.\n\nAt (8,2), it's dot, which is fine. Then moving down to (8,1), which is the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I will grow, so my tail will extend. But since it's just one move, I don't need to worry about hitting my own tail yet.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move right to (8,2).\n\nBut, I should also think about the next move. After moving right to (8,2), I will need to move down to (8,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that moving down from (8,2) is safe. Let's see:\n\nAt (8,1), it's the apple, which is fine. After eating it, I grow, so my tail extends.\n\nBut, I need to plan further ahead. After eating the apple at (8,1), what's my next target?\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (6,4), (4,6), (8,9), (0,9).\n\nThe closest one from (8,1) would be (8,9), which is up 8 units. But there might be better options.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (6,4), which is left 2 and up 3 from (8,1).\n\nLet me calculate the distances from (8,1):\n\n- (6,4): |6-8| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-8| + |6-1| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n- (8,9): |8-8| + |9-1| = 0 + 8 = 8\n\n- (0,9): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16\n\nSo, the closest is (6,4) at 5 units.\n\nSo, after eating (8,1), I should head towards (6,4).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake or create a situation where I box myself in.\n\nLooking at the board, from (8,1), moving left to (7,1), then (6,1), then up to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to ensure that the path is clear.\n\nAt (7,1): dot\n\nAt (6,1): dot\n\nAt (6,2): dot\n\nAt (6,3): dot\n\nAt (6,4): apple\n\nSo, it seems clear.\n\nBut, I need to consider the growth of my snake. After eating the first apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail later on.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated for just one move.\n\nMaybe I should simplify and just focus on getting to the closest apple, which is (8,1), and worry about the rest later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for a different apple that might be easier or safer.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6,4), which is another close one with a distance of 3 from my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then up to (6,4).\n\nBut that's 2 moves away, whereas the apple at (8,1) is only 2 moves away as well.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider which path is less likely to encounter the other snake.\n\nThe other snake is at (4,8), and it's not moving yet, as per the information provided.\n\nBut in reality, snakes can move, so I need to anticipate possible movements.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the other snake's direction or intelligence, I'll assume it moves randomly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps sticking to the path towards (8,1) is safer, as it's on the edge of the board, and I can avoid the center where the other snake might be.\n\nBut, after eating (8,1), I need to be careful not to get boxed in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (6,4) first.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nOption 1: Go to (8,1)\n\n- Move right to (8,2)\n\n- Move down to (8,1)\n\n- Eat apple, grow\n\n- Move left to (7,1)\n\n- Move left to (6,1)\n\n- Move up to (6,2)\n\n- Move up to (6,3)\n\n- Move up to (6,4)\n\nThat's 8 moves in total.\n\nOption 2: Go directly to (6,4)\n\n- Move left to (6,2)\n\n- Move up to (6,3)\n\n- Move up to (6,4)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nBut, in Option 1, I eat one apple"

However, it's quite far away, and I don't want to risk the enemy snake reaching it first.\n\nThe apple at (4, 6) is still the closest one, just 3 spaces directly below me.

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (6,4), (8,1), and (4,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,9), but it doesn't have any body parts yet, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right. My goal is to eat apples and get points, while avoiding walls, other snakes, and myself.\n\nLet me visualize the board. Row 9 is the top row, and row 0 is the bottom row. Column 0 is the leftmost column, and column 9 is the rightmost.\n\nSo, I'm at (7,3), which is row 3, column 7.\n\nLet me list the apples and their distances from my current position using Manhattan distance.\n\n1. (8,9): |8-7| + |9-3| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n2. (0,9): |0-7| + |9-3| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n3. (6,4): |6-7| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n4. (8,1): |8-7| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n5. (4,6): |4-7| + |6-3| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,4) with a distance of 2, followed by (8,1) at distance 3.\n\nHmm, I need to decide which one to go for first. The closest one is (6,4), but (8,1) is also pretty close.\n\nLet me think about the paths.\n\nTo (6,4):\n\nFrom (7,3), I can move left to (6,3), then up to (6,4). That's two moves.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\nFrom (7,3), I can move right to (8,3), then down to (8,2), then down to (8,1). That's three moves.\n\nWait, is (8,1) really three moves away? Let's see:\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\nYes, that's three moves.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated the Manhattan distance to (8,1) as 3, but in terms of moves, it's actually three moves.\n\nWait, no. Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences in x and y coordinates, which corresponds directly to the number of moves if you can move in the four cardinal directions.\n\nSo, to (6,4), it's 1 left and 1 up, total 2 moves.\n\nTo (8,1), it's 1 right and 2 down, total 3 moves.\n\nSo, (6,4) is closer in terms of moves.\n\nBut, I should also consider the position of the other snake.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,9), and it's possible it will move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to make sure that the path to the apple doesn't lead me into the path of the other snake.\n\nLet me see where the other snake is.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,9), and there are no body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to anticipate where it might go.\n\nLooking at the apples, from its position at (4,9), the closest apple is at (0,9), which is 4 units away (Manhattan distance 4), or (8,9), which is 4 units away as well.\n\nAlternatively, (4,6) is 3 units down.\n\nSo, it might go towards (4,6) first.\n\nBut, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for (6,4), which is closer and not directly in the path of the other snake.\n\nLet me plan the path to (6,4):\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n- Left to (6,3)\n\n- Up to (6,4)\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), I will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (6,4) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest is (4,6) at 4 units.\n\nFrom (6,4), to (4,6):\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\n- Up to (4,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (8,1), which is 5 units away:\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nSo, (4,6) is closer.\n\nBut, I need to consider the position of the other snake.\n\nIf snake 1 goes towards (4,6), I might run into it.\n\nAlternatively, if I go towards (8,1), it's farther, but perhaps safer.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just focus on the closest apple, which is (6,4), and worry about the next one later.\n\nLet me proceed with that plan.\n\nSo, first move: left to (6,3).\n\nThen, up to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for now, just planning the first move.\n\nSo, moving left to (6,3).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, at (6,3), it's empty, as per the board state provided.\n\nSo, it's safe to move there.\n\nThen, next move would be up to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow, so my tail will be at (7,3), where I was previously.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto (7,3).\n\nBut, since I'm moving left to (6,3), and then up to (6,4), and then planning to move towards (4,6), I should be fine.\n\nWait, no. After eating the apple at (6,4), my tail is at (6,3), because that's where I came from.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, the tail extends in the direction you came from.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,3) to (6,3), then to (6,4), my tail will still be at (7,3).\n\nWait, no, in some Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows by one segment, so the tail stays where it was before you moved.\n\nWait, I need to clarify how the tail works in this game.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, your snake grows, meaning that your tail stays in place until the rest of your snake moves.\n\nSo, in this case, when I eat the apple at (6,4), my tail remains at (6,3), and as I continue moving, the tail stays there until the rest of the snake moves forward.\n\nWait, actually, in classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail stays in place until the rest of the snake moves past it.\n\nBut in this game, since it's turn-based, and we're making one move at a time, I need to understand how the tail moves.\n\nAssuming that the tail follows the head's movements, but with a delay equal to the length of the snake.\n\nSince I just ate an apple, my snake has grown by one unit, so the tail remains where it was in the previous turn.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me simplify it.\n\nSuppose I'm at (7,3). I move left to (6,3). Then, I move up to (6,4) and eat the apple.\n\nNow, my snake has grown, so my tail is still at (7,3).\n\nIf I move again, say to (6,5), my tail will stay at (7,3) until the entire snake has moved past it.\n\nBut perhaps in this game, it's simpler: when you eat an apple, your snake grows, and your tail remains in place until the rest of the snake moves.\n\nBut for now, since I'm only planning one move ahead, I just need to make sure that I don't move back"

There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,8), but it doesn't have any body parts yet, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right. My goal is to eat apples and get points, while avoiding walls, other snakes, and myself.\n\nLet me visualize the board. Row 9 is the top row, and row 0 is the bottom row. Column 0 is the leftmost column, and column 9 is the rightmost.\n\nSo, I'm at (7,4), which is row 4, column 7.\n\nLet me list the apples and their distances from my current position using Manhattan distance.\n\n1. (8,9): |8-7| + |9-4| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n2. (0,9): |0-7| + |9-4| = 7 + 5 = 12\n\n3. (6,4): |6-7| + |4-4| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n4. (8,1): |8-7| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n5. (4,6): |4-7| + |6-4| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,4) with a distance of 1, which is directly to my left.\n\nHmm, that's interesting. The apple is right next to me at (6,4). I can reach it by moving left.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe. Let's check if there's any obstacle there.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, at (6,4), there's an apple, and at (7,4), there's my head.\n\nMoving left to (6,4) should be safe because there's no other snake there, and it's within the board boundaries.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), my snake will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nI need to plan my next moves after eating this apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), I can consider which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (6,4) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apple from (6,4) is (4,6) with a distance of 4.\n\nAlternatively, (8,1) is at distance 5.\n\nI should consider which one to go for next.\n\nBut perhaps I should focus on just getting the closest apple first, which is (6,4), and then decide afterwards.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the other snake's position and potential movements.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,8), and it's possible it will move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to make sure that my path to the apple doesn't lead me into the path of the other snake.\n\nLooking at the board, snake 1 is at (4,8), and the apple at (4,6) is directly below it.\n\nSo, snake 1 might go down to eat the apple at (4,6).\n\nIf that's the case, and I go to (6,4), then I need to make sure that I don't cross paths with snake 1.\n\nBut right now, snake 1 is at (4,8), and I'm at (7,4). There's some distance between us.\n\nI think the immediate priority is to eat the closest apple at (6,4).\n\nAfter eating that, I can consider moving towards (4,6), but I need to be cautious of snake 1.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (8,1), which is farther but might be safer.\n\nBut, since (4,6) is closer, maybe I can get there before snake 1.\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,8), and the apple at (4,6) is two steps down.\n\nIf snake 1 moves down twice, it can reach (4,6).\n\nI'm at (7,4), and after eating (6,4), I can move towards (4,6) in four steps.\n\nSo, snake 1 might reach (4,6) before me if it moves directly there.\n\nTherefore, perhaps going for (8,1) would be a better choice in the long run.\n\nBut, for now, I'll stick with going for the closest apple at (6,4).\n\nAfter eating that, I'll have to decide whether to go for (4,6) or (8,1).\n\nPerhaps I'll cross that bridge when I get there.\n\nFor now, my immediate move is to go left to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nI need to make sure that after eating the apple, my tail extends, so I have to ensure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut since I'm only moving left once to eat the apple, and then planning to move up or down afterwards, I should be fine.\n\nSo, my decision for this turn is to move left to (6,4).\n\n**Final Decision: LEFT**"

Wait, no, the board state shows:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, the apple is at (6,4), and I'm at (7,4). So, to eat that apple, I need to move left to (6,4).\n\nWait, but in the board state, it's shown as (7,4) for my position, but in the initial information, it's (6,4). There's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me double-check the initial information:\n\n\"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (6,4)\"\n\nBut in the board state, it shows:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, perhaps there's a mistake in the board state or the initial position.\n\nAssuming the initial position is correct, I'm at (6,4), and there's an apple at (6,4). Wait, that can't be, because if I'm at (6,4) and there's an apple there, I should have already eaten it.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (6,4), and I need to move to (6,4) to eat it.\n\nBut if I'm already at (6,4), then moving to (6,4) wouldn't make sense. Maybe the apple is at (7,4), where I am now.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify the positions.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\n- Row 4: positions (0,4) to (9,4)\n\n- Column 4: positions (0,4) to (0,9)\n\nWait, actually, the board is displayed with rows and columns, but I need to make sure I'm interpreting the coordinates correctly.\n\nIn the board state:\n\n- Row 9: positions (0,9) to (9,9)\n\n- Row 8: positions (0,8) to (9,8)\n\n...\n\n- Row 0: positions (0,0) to (9,0)\n\nAnd columns are from 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my position at (6,4) means column 6, row 4.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (8,9) is column 8, row 9.\n\nGiven that, in the board state, it shows:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, at (6,4), there's an apple, and at (7,4), there's my head.\n\nTherefore, to eat the apple at (6,4), I need to move left to (6,4).\n\nWait, but I'm already at (7,4), and the apple is at (6,4). So, moving left to (6,4) should be safe, as there's an apple there and no other snake.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe and that I don't collide with anything.\n\nLooking at the board, moving left from (7,4) to (6,4) is fine, as there's only the apple there.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I need to plan my next moves.\n\nLooking at the distances to other apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- (2,8): |2-6| + |8-4| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6) with a distance of 4.\n\nBut considering that snake 1 is at (4,7), which is close to (4,6), I need to be cautious.\n\nSnake 1 might move towards (4,6) as well.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider going for (8,1), which is at a distance of 5.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (4,6), but I need to see if I can get there before snake 1.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,7), and (4,6) is directly below it.\n\nIf snake 1 moves down, it can reach (4,6) before I can get there from (6,4).\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (8,1) would be a safer choice.\n\nBut (8,1) is at a distance of 5, while (4,6) is at 4.\n\nWait, but after eating the apple at (6,4), I can calculate the path.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, move left to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, from (6,4), I can consider moving towards (4,6) or (8,1).\n\nLet's calculate the steps:\n\nTo (4,6):\n\n- From (6,4) to (4,6): move left twice and up twice.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\n- From (6,4) to (8,1): move right twice and down three times.\n\nSo, to (4,6):\n\n1. Left to (5,4)\n\n2. Left to (4,4)\n\n3. Up to (4,5)\n\n4. Up to (4,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\n1. Right to (7,4)\n\n2. Right to (8,4)\n\n3. Down to (8,3)\n\n4. Down to (8,2)\n\n5. Down to (8,1)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nSo, going to (4,6) is faster.\n\nBut, as I mentioned earlier, snake 1 is at (4,7), and it can reach (4,6) in two moves:\n\n1. Down to (4,6)\n\nSo, if I go to (4,6) in four moves, snake 1 can reach there in two moves.\n\nTherefore, snake 1 will get to (4,6) before me.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for (8,1) instead.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to block snake 1's path to (4,6), but that might not be feasible given the distances.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (8,9), which is farther, but perhaps safer.\n\nBut it's at a distance of 7, which is quite far, and there might be other snakes moving towards it.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (8,1) is a better choice.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,4), I should head towards (8,1).\n\nBut first things first, I need to move left to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, from (6,4), I'll plan to go to (8,1).\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path is clear and that I don't run into snake 1 or any walls.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake.

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a move in this Snake game. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I'm snake number 2, and I'm currently at position (4,5). Wait, in the last move information, it said I was at (4,5), but in the board state, it shows snake 2 at (4,5). So, I need to confirm my current position. Looking back, in the last move, I moved up from (4,4) to (4,5). So, now I'm at (4,5).\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (8,1), (4,6), and (5,7). There's also another snake, number 1, at (2,8), with its body at (3,8).\n\nLet me first list out all the positions:\n\n- My head: (4,5)\n\n- Enemy snake head: (2,8), body: (3,8)\n\n- Apples: (8,9), (0,9), (8,1), (4,6), (5,7)\n\nI need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions around me and see which moves are safe.\n\nLet's look at each possible move:\n\n1. Up: from (4,5) to (4,6)\n\n2. Down: from (4,5) to (4,4)\n\n3. Left: from (4,5) to (3,5)\n\n4. Right: from (4,5) to (5,5)\n\nI need to check for each direction:\n\n- Is the new position within bounds? (0 <= x < 10, 0 <= y < 10)\n\n- Is the new position not occupied by another snake (including myself) or a wall?\n\n- Is there an apple there? If yes, moving there will make me grow.\n\nAlso, I need to think about future moves to avoid trapping myself.\n\nLet's evaluate each direction:\n\n1. Up: (4,6)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? No, according to the board state.\n\n- Is there an apple there? Yes, at (4,6).\n\nSo, moving up would mean I eat the apple and grow longer.\n\n2. Down: (4,4)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? No.\n\n- Is there an apple there? No.\n\nMoving down is safe for now, but there's no apple there.\n\n3. Left: (3,5)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? Let's see. Enemy snake is at (2,8) and (3,8), so its head and body. Position (3,5) is empty.\n\n- Is there an apple there? No.\n\nSo, moving left is safe.\n\n4. Right: (5,5)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? No.\n\n- Is there an apple there? No.\n\nMoving right is also safe.\n\nNow, among the safe moves, moving up would get me an apple, which is beneficial.\n\nBut I should consider the position after eating the apple.\n\nIf I move up to (4,6), I eat the apple and grow. My tail will stay where it is unless I don't move it, but in Snake, typically, moving to a new position shifts the entire body forward, and the tail moves accordingly.\n\nWait, in this game, when you move, your entire body shifts forward, and the tail moves to where the second-to-last segment was, and so on, provided you don't eat an apple. If you eat an apple, your tail stays in place, effectively making your snake longer.\n\nBut I need to confirm the mechanics. From the rules:\n\n1. If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\n2. If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\n3. The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nSo, when I eat an apple, I grow, meaning my length increases by one, and I gain a point.\n\nTherefore, moving to (4,6) would make me eat the apple, and my tail would not move back, effectively extending my snake.\n\nBut I need to plan my next moves to ensure I don't immediately run into my own body.\n\nWait, but in Snake, typically, when you eat an apple, your tail stays where it is for that move, and then on the next move, it moves as usual, but since you've grown, the tail remains extended.\n\nBut I need to think carefully.\n\nLet's assume that after eating the apple, my snake becomes longer by one segment.\n\nSo, if I'm currently at (4,5), and I move up to (4,6), eating the apple, my tail remains where it was, but since this is the first move, I don't have a body yet, so my tail is just my previous head position, (4,5).\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, you have a body that follows the head. So, if I'm just the head at (4,5), and I move to (4,6), eating an apple, my body doesn't immediately follow; instead, my tail remains at (4,5), and my head is now at (4,6), with the apple consumed.\n\nBut in the next move, if I move again, my tail would move forward.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of a body list.\n\nLet's simplify: suppose I'm currently just a head at (4,5). After eating the apple at (4,6), my snake becomes longer by one segment.\n\nSo, my body would now be:\n\n- Head: (4,6)\n\n- Tail: (4,5)\n\nThen, in the next move, if I move up to (4,7), my body becomes:\n\n- Head: (4,7)\n\n- Body: (4,6)\n\n- Tail: (4,5)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, after eating the apple, my snake has two segments: head and tail.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that in my future moves, I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut for the immediate move, moving up to (4,6) is safe, as it's an apple, and I'll grow.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after that.\n\nIf I move up to (4,6), then in the next move, I can choose to move up to (4,7), down to (4,5), left to (3,6), or right to (5,6).\n\nI need to ensure that whichever direction I choose next doesn't lead me to collide with my own tail or other snakes.\n\nGiven that, moving up to (4,7) seems safe, as long as there are no obstacles there.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (3,6) or right to (5,6) might also be safe, depending on what's there.\n\nBut I need to plan ahead.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down to (4,5), which is where my tail is after eating the apple.\n\nBut in Snake, moving back to where your tail is typically doesn't cause a collision, because by the time you move there, your tail has moved forward.\n\nWait, no. In Snake, if you move back to where your tail was, by the time you get there, your tail has moved, so you don't collide with it.\n\nBut in this game, since it's turn-based, and moves are simultaneous, I need to be careful.\n\nWait, actually, in most Snake games, moves are based on a queue: your head moves first, and then the body follows in the next turns.\n\nBut to simplify, perhaps I should consider that after eating the apple, my snake is now two segments: head at (4,6), tail at (4,5).\n\nThen, if I move up to (4,7), my tail moves to (4,6).\n\nIf I then move up again to (4,8), my tail moves to (4,7), and so on.\n\nSo, as long as I don't make a U-turn and go back to (4,5) before my tail has moved out of that position, I should be safe.\n\nBut in this case, since my tail is at (4,5) after eating the apple, and if I move up to (4,7) next, my tail moves to (4,6).\n\nThen, if I move up to (4,8), my tail moves to (4,7).\n\nSo, I'm safe.\n\nTherefore, moving up to (4,6) seems like a good idea, as it gets me an apple and allows me to continue moving up without immediately colliding with my own tail.\n\nBut I should also consider the position of the other snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,8), with body at (3,8).\n\nIf I move up to (4,6), and then continue moving up to (4,7), (4,8), and so on, I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't moving towards me.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake's position, it's at (2,8), with body at (3,8).\n\nIf it moves right to (4,8), then to (5,8), and so on, it might not immediately pose a threat to me.\n\nBut I need to consider its possible moves.\n\nAlternatively, if it moves"

No.\n\n- Is there an apple there? No.\n\nMoving right is also safe.\n\nNow, since none of the immediate moves lead to an apple, I need to think about which direction could potentially lead me to an apple soon.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (8,9): that's up and to the right.\n\n- (0,9): that's up and to the left.\n\n- (8,1): that's down and to the right.\n\n- (4,6): that's up a bit.\n\n- (5,7): that's up.\n\nAmong these, (5,7) is the closest, only two steps up from my current position.\n\nSo, perhaps I should consider moving up towards (5,7).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving up is safe in the short term.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 5: ... 2 ...\n\nRow 6: .....\n\nRow 7: ....A...\n\nSo, moving up to (5,6), then to (5,7) to eat the apple.\n\nI need to ensure that after eating the apple, I don't immediately run into a problem.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that the next move after that is also safe.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake's movement.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,9), with body at (2,8). It might move towards the apples or towards me, depending on its strategy.\n\nI should try to predict its movement.\n\nIf it moves down towards me, I need to avoid it.\n\nBut for now, it's relatively far away.\n\nSo, focusing on getting the apple at (5,7), I think moving up to (5,6) is a good first step.\n\nThen, next turn, I can move up again to (5,7) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will be longer, so I need to be careful not to collide with my own tail.\n\nBut for now, since I'm just the head, moving up to (5,6) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards another apple, but (5,7) is the closest.\n\nLet me think about the path to (5,7):\n\n- Current: (5,5)\n\n- Up: (5,6)\n\n- Up: (5,7) - apple\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will be:\n\n- Head: (5,7)\n\n- Tail: (5,6)\n\nThen, next move, if I move up to (5,8), my tail moves to (5,7).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't immediately surround myself.\n\nLooking at the board, there don't seem to be any immediate dangers in moving up to (5,6) and then to (5,7).\n\nSo, I think moving up is a safe and strategic move for now.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's movement and adjust my path if necessary.\n\nBut for this turn, moving up seems like the best choice.\n\n**Final Decision: UP**"

So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: A (at 8,9), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 0,9)\n\nRow 8: dot, dot, dot, dot, 1 (snake 1 at 4,8), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 7: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 6: dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 4,6), dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 5: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 4: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 6,4), dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 3: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nRow 2: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, 2 (my snake at 7,2), dot, dot\n\nRow 1: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, A (at 8,1), dot\n\nRow 0: dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot\n\nOkay, so I'm at (7,2), which is in row 2, column 7. I need to decide whether to go up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nLet me list the apples:\n\n1. (8,9)\n\n2. (0,9)\n\n3. (6,4)\n\n4. (8,1)\n\n5. (4,6)\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. Maybe the closest one to minimize the moves.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n1. To (8,9): |8-7| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n2. To (0,9): |0-7| + |9-2| = 7 + 7 = 14\n\n3. To (6,4): |6-7| + |4-2| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n4. To (8,1): |8-7| + |1-2| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n5. To (4,6): |4-7| + |6-2| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (8,1) with a distance of 2, followed by (6,4) at 3, then (4,6) at 7, (8,9) at 8, and (0,9) at 14.\n\nMaybe I should go for the closest apple at (8,1). But I need to make sure there are no obstacles in the way.\n\nLet's see: from (7,2), I can move right to (8,2), then down to (8,1), which is the apple.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any snakes or walls in the way.\n\nLooking at the board, at (8,2), it's dot, and at (8,1), it's apple. So, it's clear.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the other snake at (4,8). It's pretty far away, and it doesn't have any body parts, so it's less of a concern for now.\n\nSo, my plan is to move right to (8,2), then down to (8,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that moving right to (8,2) is safe. Let's check the surroundings.\n\nAt (8,2), it's dot, which is fine. Then moving down to (8,1), which is the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I will grow, so my tail will extend. But since it's just one move, I don't need to worry about hitting my own tail yet.\n\nSo, for this turn, I should move right to (8,2).\n\nBut, I should also think about the next move. After moving right to (8,2), I will need to move down to (8,1) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that moving down from (8,2) is safe. Let's see:\n\nAt (8,1), it's the apple, which is fine. After eating it, I grow, so my tail extends.\n\nBut, I need to plan further ahead. After eating the apple at (8,1), what's my next target?\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (6,4), (4,6), (8,9), (0,9).\n\nThe closest one from (8,1) would be (8,9), which is up 8 units. But there might be better options.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (6,4), which is left 2 and up 3 from (8,1).\n\nLet me calculate the distances from (8,1):\n\n- (6,4): |6-8| + |4-1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-8| + |6-1| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n- (8,9): |8-8| + |9-1| = 0 + 8 = 8\n\n- (0,9): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16\n\nSo, the closest is (6,4) at 5 units.\n\nSo, after eating (8,1), I should head towards (6,4).\n\nBut, I need to make sure that I don't run into the other snake or create a situation where I box myself in.\n\nLooking at the board, from (8,1), moving left to (7,1), then (6,1), then up to (6,2), (6,3), (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nBut, I need to ensure that the path is clear.\n\nAt (7,1): dot\n\nAt (6,1): dot\n\nAt (6,2): dot\n\nAt (6,3): dot\n\nAt (6,4): apple\n\nSo, it seems clear.\n\nBut, I need to consider the growth of my snake. After eating the first apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail later on.\n\nThis is getting a bit complicated for just one move.\n\nMaybe I should simplify and just focus on getting to the closest apple, which is (8,1), and worry about the rest later.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for a different apple that might be easier or safer.\n\nLet's look at the apple at (6,4), which is another close one with a distance of 3 from my current position.\n\nFrom (7,2), I can move left to (6,2), then up to (6,3), then up to (6,4).\n\nBut that's 2 moves away, whereas the apple at (8,1) is only 2 moves away as well.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I should consider which path is less likely to encounter the other snake.\n\nThe other snake is at (4,8), and it's not moving yet, as per the information provided.\n\nBut in reality, snakes can move, so I need to anticipate possible movements.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the other snake's direction or intelligence, I'll assume it moves randomly.\n\nGiven that, perhaps sticking to the path towards (8,1) is safer, as it's on the edge of the board, and I can avoid the center where the other snake might be.\n\nBut, after eating (8,1), I need to be careful not to get boxed in.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for (6,4) first.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\nOption 1: Go to (8,1)\n\n- Move right to (8,2)\n\n- Move down to (8,1)\n\n- Eat apple, grow\n\n- Move left to (7,1)\n\n- Move left to (6,1)\n\n- Move up to (6,2)\n\n- Move up to (6,3)\n\n- Move up to (6,4)\n\nThat's 8 moves in total.\n\nOption 2: Go directly to (6,4)\n\n- Move left to (6,2)\n\n- Move up to (6,3)\n\n- Move up to (6,4)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nBut, in Option 1, I eat one apple"

However, it's quite far away, and I don't want to risk the enemy snake reaching it first.\n\nThe apple at (4, 6) is still the closest one, just 3 spaces directly below me.

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (6,4), (8,1), and (4,6). There's also another snake, number 1, at (4,9), but it doesn't have any body parts yet, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right. My goal is to eat apples and get points, while avoiding walls, other snakes, and myself.\n\nLet me visualize the board. Row 9 is the top row, and row 0 is the bottom row. Column 0 is the leftmost column, and column 9 is the rightmost.\n\nSo, I'm at (7,3), which is row 3, column 7.\n\nLet me list the apples and their distances from my current position using Manhattan distance.\n\n1. (8,9): |8-7| + |9-3| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n2. (0,9): |0-7| + |9-3| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n3. (6,4): |6-7| + |4-3| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\n4. (8,1): |8-7| + |1-3| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n5. (4,6): |4-7| + |6-3| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (6,4) with a distance of 2, followed by (8,1) at distance 3.\n\nHmm, I need to decide which one to go for first. The closest one is (6,4), but (8,1) is also pretty close.\n\nLet me think about the paths.\n\nTo (6,4):\n\nFrom (7,3), I can move left to (6,3), then up to (6,4). That's two moves.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\nFrom (7,3), I can move right to (8,3), then down to (8,2), then down to (8,1). That's three moves.\n\nWait, is (8,1) really three moves away? Let's see:\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n- Right to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\nYes, that's three moves.\n\nBut earlier, I calculated the Manhattan distance to (8,1) as 3, but in terms of moves, it's actually three moves.\n\nWait, no. Manhattan distance is the sum of the absolute differences in x and y coordinates, which corresponds directly to the number of moves if you can move in the four cardinal directions.\n\nSo, to (6,4), it's 1 left and 1 up, total 2 moves.\n\nTo (8,1), it's 1 right and 2 down, total 3 moves.\n\nSo, (6,4) is closer in terms of moves.\n\nBut, I should also consider the position of the other snake.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,9), and it's possible it will move towards one of the apples as well.\n\nI need to make sure that the path to the apple doesn't lead me into the path of the other snake.\n\nLet me see where the other snake is.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,9), and there are no body parts listed, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to anticipate where it might go.\n\nLooking at the apples, from its position at (4,9), the closest apple is at (0,9), which is 4 units away (Manhattan distance 4), or (8,9), which is 4 units away as well.\n\nAlternatively, (4,6) is 3 units down.\n\nSo, it might go towards (4,6) first.\n\nBut, this is just a guess.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for (6,4), which is closer and not directly in the path of the other snake.\n\nLet me plan the path to (6,4):\n\nFrom (7,3):\n\n- Left to (6,3)\n\n- Up to (6,4)\n\nAfter eating the apple at (6,4), I will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nThen, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's see the distances from (6,4) to the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest is (4,6) at 4 units.\n\nFrom (6,4), to (4,6):\n\n- Left to (5,4)\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Up to (4,5)\n\n- Up to (4,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (8,1), which is 5 units away:\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\n- Down to (8,2)\n\n- Down to (8,1)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nSo, (4,6) is closer.\n\nBut, I need to consider the position of the other snake.\n\nIf snake 1 goes towards (4,6), I might run into it.\n\nAlternatively, if I go towards (8,1), it's farther, but perhaps safer.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just focus on the closest apple, which is (6,4), and worry about the next one later.\n\nLet me proceed with that plan.\n\nSo, first move: left to (6,3).\n\nThen, up to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto my own tail.\n\nBut for now, just planning the first move.\n\nSo, moving left to (6,3).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, at (6,3), it's empty, as per the board state provided.\n\nSo, it's safe to move there.\n\nThen, next move would be up to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I grow, so my tail will be at (7,3), where I was previously.\n\nSo, I need to make sure that I don't turn back onto (7,3).\n\nBut, since I'm moving left to (6,3), and then up to (6,4), and then planning to move towards (4,6), I should be fine.\n\nWait, no. After eating the apple at (6,4), my tail is at (6,3), because that's where I came from.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, the tail extends in the direction you came from.\n\nSo, if I move from (7,3) to (6,3), then to (6,4), my tail will still be at (7,3).\n\nWait, no, in some Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail grows by one segment, so the tail stays where it was before you moved.\n\nWait, I need to clarify how the tail works in this game.\n\nWhen you eat an apple, your snake grows, meaning that your tail stays in place until the rest of your snake moves.\n\nSo, in this case, when I eat the apple at (6,4), my tail remains at (6,3), and as I continue moving, the tail stays there until the rest of the snake moves forward.\n\nWait, actually, in classic Snake, when you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail stays in place until the rest of the snake moves past it.\n\nBut in this game, since it's turn-based, and we're making one move at a time, I need to understand how the tail moves.\n\nAssuming that the tail follows the head's movements, but with a delay equal to the length of the snake.\n\nSince I just ate an apple, my snake has grown by one unit, so the tail remains where it was in the previous turn.\n\nWait, this is getting confusing.\n\nLet me simplify it.\n\nSuppose I'm at (7,3). I move left to (6,3). Then, I move up to (6,4) and eat the apple.\n\nNow, my snake has grown, so my tail is still at (7,3).\n\nIf I move again, say to (6,5), my tail will stay at (7,3) until the entire snake has moved past it.\n\nBut perhaps in this game, it's simpler: when you eat an apple, your snake grows, and your tail remains in place until the rest of the snake moves.\n\nBut for now, since I'm only planning one move ahead, I just need to make sure that I don't move back"

(2,8): |2-6| + |8-4| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6) with a distance of 4.\n\nBut wait, in my previous move, I thought the apple at (6,4) was the closest, but looking at the current positions, I see that there is an apple at (6,4), but in the board state you provided, it's actually at (7,4), which is where I am now. Wait, no, the board state shows:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, the apple is at (6,4), and I'm at (7,4). So, to eat that apple, I need to move left to (6,4).\n\nWait, but in the board state, it's shown as (7,4) for my position, but in the initial information, it's (6,4). There's a discrepancy here.\n\nLet me double-check the initial information:\n\n\"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (6,4)\"\n\nBut in the board state, it shows:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, perhaps there's a mistake in the board state or the initial position.\n\nAssuming the initial position is correct, I'm at (6,4), and there's an apple at (6,4). Wait, that can't be, because if I'm at (6,4) and there's an apple there, I should have already eaten it.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (6,4), and I need to move to (6,4) to eat it.\n\nBut if I'm already at (6,4), then moving to (6,4) wouldn't make sense. Maybe the apple is at (7,4), where I am now.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused. Let's clarify the positions.\n\nFrom the board state:\n\n- Row 4: positions (0,4) to (9,4)\n\n- Column 4: positions (0,4) to (0,9)\n\nWait, actually, the board is displayed with rows and columns, but I need to make sure I'm interpreting the coordinates correctly.\n\nIn the board state:\n\n- Row 9: positions (0,9) to (9,9)\n\n- Row 8: positions (0,8) to (9,8)\n\n...\n\n- Row 0: positions (0,0) to (9,0)\n\nAnd columns are from 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my position at (6,4) means column 6, row 4.\n\nSimilarly, the apple at (8,9) is column 8, row 9.\n\nGiven that, in the board state, it shows:\n\nRow 4: ... A (6,4) ... 2 (7,4) ...\n\nSo, at (6,4), there's an apple, and at (7,4), there's my head.\n\nTherefore, to eat the apple at (6,4), I need to move left to (6,4).\n\nWait, but I'm already at (7,4), and the apple is at (6,4). So, moving left to (6,4) should be safe, as there's an apple there and no other snake.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will grow, so my tail will extend by one block.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe and that I don't collide with anything.\n\nLooking at the board, moving left from (7,4) to (6,4) is fine, as there's only the apple there.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I need to plan my next moves.\n\nLooking at the distances to other apples:\n\n- (8,9): |8-6| + |9-4| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- (0,9): |0-6| + |9-4| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- (8,1): |8-6| + |1-4| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (4,6): |4-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- (2,8): |2-6| + |8-4| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (4,6) with a distance of 4.\n\nBut considering that snake 1 is at (4,7), which is close to (4,6), I need to be cautious.\n\nSnake 1 might move towards (4,6) as well.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should consider going for (8,1), which is at a distance of 5.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (4,6), but I need to see if I can get there before snake 1.\n\nSnake 1 is at (4,7), and (4,6) is directly below it.\n\nIf snake 1 moves down, it can reach (4,6) before I can get there from (6,4).\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (8,1) would be a safer choice.\n\nBut (8,1) is at a distance of 5, while (4,6) is at 4.\n\nWait, but after eating the apple at (6,4), I can calculate the path.\n\nLet's think step by step.\n\nFirst, move left to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, from (6,4), I can consider moving towards (4,6) or (8,1).\n\nLet's calculate the steps:\n\nTo (4,6):\n\n- From (6,4) to (4,6): move left twice and up twice.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\n- From (6,4) to (8,1): move right twice and down three times.\n\nSo, to (4,6):\n\n1. Left to (5,4)\n\n2. Left to (4,4)\n\n3. Up to (4,5)\n\n4. Up to (4,6)\n\nThat's four moves.\n\nTo (8,1):\n\n1. Right to (7,4)\n\n2. Right to (8,4)\n\n3. Down to (8,3)\n\n4. Down to (8,2)\n\n5. Down to (8,1)\n\nThat's five moves.\n\nSo, going to (4,6) is faster.\n\nBut, as I mentioned earlier, snake 1 is at (4,7), and it can reach (4,6) in two moves:\n\n1. Down to (4,6)\n\nSo, if I go to (4,6) in four moves, snake 1 can reach there in two moves.\n\nTherefore, snake 1 will get to (4,6) before me.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should go for (8,1) instead.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to block snake 1's path to (4,6), but that might not be feasible given the distances.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (8,9), which is farther, but perhaps safer.\n\nBut it's at a distance of 7, which is quite far, and there might be other snakes moving towards it.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (8,1) is a better choice.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (6,4), I should head towards (8,1).\n\nBut first things first, I need to move left to (6,4) to eat the apple.\n\nThen, from (6,4), I'll plan to go to (8,1).\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path is clear and that I don't run into snake 1 or any walls.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake.

Wait, in the last move information, it said I was at (4,5), but in the board state, it shows snake 2 at (4,5). So, I need to confirm my current position. Looking back, in the last move, I moved up from (4,4) to (4,5). So, now I'm at (4,5).\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (8,1), (4,6), and (5,7). There's also another snake, number 1, at (2,8), with its body at (3,8).\n\nLet me first list out all the positions:\n\n- My head: (4,5)\n\n- Enemy snake head: (2,8), body: (3,8)\n\n- Apples: (8,9), (0,9), (8,1), (4,6), (5,7)\n\nI need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions around me and see which moves are safe.\n\nLet's look at each possible move:\n\n1. Up: from (4,5) to (4,6)\n\n2. Down: from (4,5) to (4,4)\n\n3. Left: from (4,5) to (3,5)\n\n4. Right: from (4,5) to (5,5)\n\nI need to check for each direction:\n\n- Is the new position within bounds? (0 <= x < 10, 0 <= y < 10)\n\n- Is the new position not occupied by another snake (including myself) or a wall?\n\n- Is there an apple there? If yes, moving there will make me grow.\n\nAlso, I need to think about future moves to avoid trapping myself.\n\nLet's evaluate each direction:\n\n1. Up: (4,6)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? No, according to the board state.\n\n- Is there an apple there? Yes, at (4,6).\n\nSo, moving up would mean I eat the apple and grow longer.\n\n2. Down: (4,4)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? No.\n\n- Is there an apple there? No.\n\nMoving down is safe for now, but there's no apple there.\n\n3. Left: (3,5)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? Let's see. Enemy snake is at (2,8) and (3,8), so its head and body. Position (3,5) is empty.\n\n- Is there an apple there? No.\n\nSo, moving left is safe.\n\n4. Right: (5,5)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? No.\n\n- Is there an apple there? No.\n\nMoving right is also safe.\n\nNow, among the safe moves, moving up would get me an apple, which is beneficial.\n\nBut I should consider the position after eating the apple.\n\nIf I move up to (4,6), I eat the apple and grow. My tail will stay where it is unless I don't move it, but in Snake, typically, moving to a new position shifts the entire body forward, and the tail moves accordingly.\n\nWait, in this game, when you move, your entire body shifts forward, and the tail moves to where the second-to-last segment was, and so on, provided you don't eat an apple. If you eat an apple, your tail stays in place, effectively making your snake longer.\n\nBut I need to confirm the mechanics. From the rules:\n\n1. If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n\n2. If you run into a wall, another snake, or yourself, you die.\n\n3. The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nSo, when I eat an apple, I grow, meaning my length increases by one, and I gain a point.\n\nTherefore, moving to (4,6) would make me eat the apple, and my tail would not move back, effectively extending my snake.\n\nBut I need to plan my next moves to ensure I don't immediately run into my own body.\n\nWait, but in Snake, typically, when you eat an apple, your tail stays where it is for that move, and then on the next move, it moves as usual, but since you've grown, the tail remains extended.\n\nBut I need to think carefully.\n\nLet's assume that after eating the apple, my snake becomes longer by one segment.\n\nSo, if I'm currently at (4,5), and I move up to (4,6), eating the apple, my tail remains where it was, but since this is the first move, I don't have a body yet, so my tail is just my previous head position, (4,5).\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, you have a body that follows the head. So, if I'm just the head at (4,5), and I move to (4,6), eating an apple, my body doesn't immediately follow; instead, my tail remains at (4,5), and my head is now at (4,6), with the apple consumed.\n\nBut in the next move, if I move again, my tail would move forward.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of a body list.\n\nLet's simplify: suppose I'm currently just a head at (4,5). After eating the apple at (4,6), my snake becomes longer by one segment.\n\nSo, my body would now be:\n\n- Head: (4,6)\n\n- Tail: (4,5)\n\nThen, in the next move, if I move up to (4,7), my body becomes:\n\n- Head: (4,7)\n\n- Body: (4,6)\n\n- Tail: (4,5)\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, after eating the apple, my snake has two segments: head and tail.\n\nNow, I need to make sure that in my future moves, I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut for the immediate move, moving up to (4,6) is safe, as it's an apple, and I'll grow.\n\nBut I need to think about what happens after that.\n\nIf I move up to (4,6), then in the next move, I can choose to move up to (4,7), down to (4,5), left to (3,6), or right to (5,6).\n\nI need to ensure that whichever direction I choose next doesn't lead me to collide with my own tail or other snakes.\n\nGiven that, moving up to (4,7) seems safe, as long as there are no obstacles there.\n\nSimilarly, moving left to (3,6) or right to (5,6) might also be safe, depending on what's there.\n\nBut I need to plan ahead.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down to (4,5), which is where my tail is after eating the apple.\n\nBut in Snake, moving back to where your tail is typically doesn't cause a collision, because by the time you move there, your tail has moved forward.\n\nWait, no. In Snake, if you move back to where your tail was, by the time you get there, your tail has moved, so you don't collide with it.\n\nBut in this game, since it's turn-based, and moves are simultaneous, I need to be careful.\n\nWait, actually, in most Snake games, moves are based on a queue: your head moves first, and then the body follows in the next turns.\n\nBut to simplify, perhaps I should consider that after eating the apple, my snake is now two segments: head at (4,6), tail at (4,5).\n\nThen, if I move up to (4,7), my tail moves to (4,6).\n\nIf I then move up again to (4,8), my tail moves to (4,7), and so on.\n\nSo, as long as I don't make a U-turn and go back to (4,5) before my tail has moved out of that position, I should be safe.\n\nBut in this case, since my tail is at (4,5) after eating the apple, and if I move up to (4,7) next, my tail moves to (4,6).\n\nThen, if I move up to (4,8), my tail moves to (4,7).\n\nSo, I'm safe.\n\nTherefore, moving up to (4,6) seems like a good idea, as it gets me an apple and allows me to continue moving up without immediately colliding with my own tail.\n\nBut I should also consider the position of the other snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,8), with body at (3,8).\n\nIf I move up to (4,6), and then continue moving up to (4,7), (4,8), and so on, I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't moving towards me.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake's position, it's at (2,8), with body at (3,8).\n\nIf it moves right to (4,8), then to (5,8), and so on, it might not immediately pose a threat to me.\n\nBut I need to consider its possible moves.\n\nAlternatively, if it moves"

The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (8,9), (0,9), (8,1), (4,6), and (5,7).

(0 <= x < 10, 0 <= y < 10)\n\n- Is the new position not occupied by another snake (including myself) or a wall?\n\n- Is there an apple there? If yes, moving there will make me grow.\n\nAlso, I need to think about future moves to avoid trapping myself.\n\nLet's evaluate each direction:\n\n1. Up: (5,6)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? No, according to the board state.\n\n- Is there an apple there? No.\n\nSo, moving up is safe, but there's no apple there.\n\n2.

Left: (4,5)\n\n- Is it within bounds? Yes.\n\n- Is it occupied by another snake? Let's see. Enemy snake is at (2,9) and (2,8), so its head and body.

No.\n\n- Is there an apple there? No.\n\nMoving right is also safe.\n\nNow, since none of the immediate moves lead to an apple, I need to think about which direction could potentially lead me to an apple soon.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (8,9): that's up and to the right.\n\n- (0,9): that's up and to the left.\n\n- (8,1): that's down and to the right.\n\n- (4,6): that's up a bit.\n\n- (5,7): that's up.\n\nAmong these, (5,7) is the closest, only two steps up from my current position.\n\nSo, perhaps I should consider moving up towards (5,7).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving up is safe in the short term.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 5: ... 2 ...\n\nRow 6: .....\n\nRow 7: ....A...\n\nSo, moving up to (5,6), then to (5,7) to eat the apple.\n\nI need to ensure that after eating the apple, I don't immediately run into a problem.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,7), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure that the next move after that is also safe.\n\nAlso, I need to be aware of the enemy snake's movement.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,9), with body at (2,8). It might move towards the apples or towards me, depending on its strategy.\n\nI should try to predict its movement.\n\nIf it moves down towards me, I need to avoid it.\n\nBut for now, it's relatively far away.\n\nSo, focusing on getting the apple at (5,7), I think moving up to (5,6) is a good first step.\n\nThen, next turn, I can move up again to (5,7) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will be longer, so I need to be careful not to collide with my own tail.\n\nBut for now, since I'm just the head, moving up to (5,6) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards another apple, but (5,7) is the closest.\n\nLet me think about the path to (5,7):\n\n- Current: (5,5)\n\n- Up: (5,6)\n\n- Up: (5,7) - apple\n\nAfter eating the apple, my snake will be:\n\n- Head: (5,7)\n\n- Tail: (5,6)\n\nThen, next move, if I move up to (5,8), my tail moves to (5,7).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nI need to make sure that I don't immediately surround myself.\n\nLooking at the board, there don't seem to be any immediate dangers in moving up to (5,6) and then to (5,7).\n\nSo, I think moving up is a safe and strategic move for now.\n\nI should also keep an eye on the enemy snake's movement and adjust my path if necessary.\n\nBut for this turn, moving up seems like the best choice.\n\n**Final Decision: UP**"

A T . . . .\n\nSo, (4,6) is an apple, and (5,6) is T, which might be part of another snake or something. Wait, in the previous move, I was at (5,6), and now I'm at (5,7). So, perhaps T is part of my body.\n\nWait, in the board state, T might represent part of my body.\n\nWait, in the board state:\n\n- A is apple\n\n- T is part of my body\n\n- 2 is my head\n\n- 1 is enemy snake head\n\n- Other numbers are enemy snake body\n\nSo, in row 6: . . . . A T . . . .\n\nA is at (4,6), and T is at (5,6), which is part of my body.\n\nSo, if I go to (4,6), after eating the apple, my tail will be at (5,7).\n\nThen, next move, I need to make sure that I don't move back to (5,7), which is now occupied by my tail.\n\nSimilarly, if I go to (6,8), after eating the apple, my tail will be at (5,7), and I need to avoid moving back to (5,7).\n\nBut in both cases, moving to either apple requires planning to not collide with my own body.\n\nI think going for (4,6) is slightly better because it's to the left, and the enemy snake is at the top-left, but moving left might bring me closer to it.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (0,9), moving down.\n\nSo, it's moving towards the center from the top.\n\nWhereas I'm at (5,7), moving left towards (4,6), which is not directly in its path.\n\nAlternatively, moving right towards (6,8) might be safer.\n\nLet me think about potential paths.\n\nIf I go for (4,6):\n\n- Move left to (4,7)\n\n- Then down to (4,6), eating the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail will be at (5,7).\n\nNext move, I can't go back to (5,7), so I need to continue moving.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (6,8):\n\n- Move right to (6,7)\n\n- Then up to (6,8), eating the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail will be at (5,7).\n\nNext move, I can't go back to (5,7), so I need to continue moving.\n\nIn both cases, I need to plan my next moves to avoid my own tail.\n\nBut considering the positions, going to (6,8) might be better because it's closer to other apples, like (8,9) and (8,1).\n\nWhereas going to (4,6) might trap me on the left side with fewer apples.\n\nLooking at the board, there are more apples on the right side.\n\n(8,9), (8,1), and (6,8) are on the right, while (4,6) and (0,5) are on the left.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (6,8) is a better choice in the long run.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (0,9), moving down.\n\nIf I move to the right, away from the enemy, it might be safer.\n\nSo, I think I should go for (6,8).\n\nTo get there:\n\n- Move up to (5,8)\n\n- Then right to (6,8), eating the apple.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n- Right to (6,7)\n\n- Then up to (6,8), eating the apple.\n\nEither way, it's two moves.\n\nI need to decide which direction to go first.\n\nIf I move up to (5,8), then right to (6,8).\n\nOr right to (6,7), then up to (6,8).\n\nI think moving right first to (6,7) might be safer because the enemy is moving down from the top, and I'm moving to the right, away from it.\n\nSo, let's choose to move right to (6,7).\n\nThen, next"
