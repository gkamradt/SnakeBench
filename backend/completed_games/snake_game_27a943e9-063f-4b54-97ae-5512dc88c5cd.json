UP \u2192 (4,9): This is safe (inside the board) and would put us on the top row. From there, the apple (6,9) is 2 cells to the right. However, being on the top row means fewer \u201cescape\u201d options if we need to adjust.\n2. RIGHT \u2192 (5,8): This is also safe. It gets us closer horizontally to (6,9), leaving us with a Manhattan distance of 2 (|6\u20135| + |9\u20138| = 1 + 1) and keeps us away from the top boundary.\n3. DOWN \u2192 (4,7): That cell is occupied by our own body, so it\u2019s not an option.\n4.

The enemy snake is far away at (4,3), so it does not factor into our immediate plan.\n\nThus, my strategy is to move DOWN now so that next turn I can simply move RIGHT into the apple. \n\nNext move: DOWN."
