After our last move, our snake\u2019s head (ID 1) is now at (4,6) because we just moved left from (5,6) to eat the apple that was at (4,6). The board shows our head as \u201c1\u201d at (4,6). The remaining apples are located at (0,9), (1,3), (2,5), (8,6), and (8,4).\n\nOur enemy snake (#2) is dangerous in the area above us. Its head is at (4,7) and its body occupies (4,8) and (3,8) (the board labels these as \u201cT\u201d in row 8 with its head shown at row 7). We must avoid moving into any enemy parts.\n\nNow, from our current head at (4,6) let\u2019s examine our safe move options:\n\u2022 UP: That would send us from (4,6) to (4,7), right into the enemy snake\u2019s head \u2013 not allowed.\n\u2022 RIGHT: Moving to (5,6) is not an option because that cell is now part of our own body (our previous head position became a body piece when we ate the apple).\n\u2022 LEFT: That leads to (3,6). It\u2019s safe, but it doesn\u2019t immediately set us on the best route toward a nearby apple.\n\u2022 DOWN: That brings us from (4,6) to (4,5), which is unoccupied and free of danger.\n\nLooking at the positions of the remaining apples, the apple at (2,5) appears attractive. It\u2019s only three moves away if we take a nice route. One viable path would be:\n\n1. Move DOWN from (4,6) to (4,5).\n2. Then move LEFT from (4,5) to (3,5).\n3. Then move LEFT from (3,5) to (2,5), where the apple stands.\n\nThis route stays away from the enemy snake (which is north of us) and heads directly toward the apple at (2,5).\n\nFor these reasons, my chosen safe and strategic move is to go DOWN.\n\nNext move: DOWN."

It\u2019s safe, but it doesn\u2019t immediately set us on the best route toward a nearby apple.\n\u2022 DOWN: That brings us from (4,6) to (4,5), which is unoccupied and free of danger.\n\nLooking at the positions of the remaining apples, the apple at (2,5) appears attractive. It\u2019s only three moves away if we take a nice route. One viable path would be:\n\n1. Move DOWN from (4,6) to (4,5).\n2. Then move LEFT from (4,5) to (3,5).\n3. Then move LEFT from (3,5) to (2,5), where the apple stands.\n\nThis route stays away from the enemy snake (which is north of us) and heads directly toward the apple at (2,5).\n\nFor these reasons, my chosen safe and strategic move is to go DOWN.\n\nNext move: DOWN."

Moving LEFT would mean going back toward our body (there\u2019s a T at (5, 0) from our recent move), and DOWN is off the board.\n\nA quick look at apple distances from (6, 0):\n\u2003\u2022 (8, 4) is 2 right and 4 up (Manhattan distance = 6),\n\u2003\u2022 (8, 6) is 2 right and 6 up (distance = 8),\n\u2003\u2022 (6, 8) is straight up (distance = 8),\n\u2003\u2022 (4, 5) is 2 left and 5 up (distance = 7),\n\u2003\u2022 (5, 9) is further away overall.\n\nOur best target is apple (8, 4).

Going UP is just as safe but keeps us closer to the tail area indicated by the T\u2019s in row 0.\n\nAlso, our enemy snake is far up in the top\u2010left area (around (3, 8)), so there isn\u2019t an immediate risk from that side.\n\nGiven the board is open in the rightward direction and positioning our head a bit farther from our own body should help in planning a path to apple (8, 4) in future moves, I\u2019ll go with moving RIGHT.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT."

(The Manhattan distance from (1,3) to (5,0) is 4 + 3 = 7; moving downward reduces the vertical gap.)\n\n\u2022 Looking at the immediate options from (1,3):\n\u2003 \u2013 UP to (1,4) would only raise us further from the apple at (5,0) and get us closer to our enemy spawning area.\n\u2003 \u2013 LEFT to (0,3) or RIGHT to (2,3) are viable, but they don\u2019t reduce the vertical gap to (5,0) and might complicate later maneuvers.\n\u2003 \u2013 DOWN to (1,2) moves us safely and begins a clear path toward one of our nearest apples with less risk.\n\nThus, my next move in this scenario is:\n\nDOWN."

(The Manhattan distance from (1,3) to (5,0) is 4 + 3 = 7; moving downward reduces the vertical gap.)\n\n\u2022 Looking at the immediate options from (1,3):\n\u2003 \u2013 UP to (1,4) would only raise us further from the apple at (5,0) and get us closer to our enemy spawning area.\n\u2003 \u2013 LEFT to (0,3) or RIGHT to (2,3) are viable, but they don\u2019t reduce the vertical gap to (5,0) and might complicate later maneuvers.\n\u2003 \u2013 DOWN to (1,2) moves us safely and begins a clear path toward one of our nearest apples with less risk.\n\nThus, my next move in this scenario is:\n\nDOWN."

This maximizes efficiency by collecting multiple apples in a single path.\n\nSince moving LEFT is safe and leads us toward two apples in sequence, LEFT is the optimal choice.\n\nLEFT"
