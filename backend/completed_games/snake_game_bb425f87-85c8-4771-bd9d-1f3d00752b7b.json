This direction keeps me at a reasonable distance from potential obstacles such as the enemy snake or the board edges.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (6, 6):\n   - Returns me back to where I came from; not advantageous in terms of apple proximity.

Given Snake #2's position at (8, 3), the path should be clear.\n\n### Decision\nConsidering the positions of the apples, I find the **RIGHT** move appealing as it will bring me directly closer to the apple at (8, 8) and keep my future options open toward a cluster of apples. This move is strategic to potentially grab the apple at (8, 8) before Snake #2 gets closer to it.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (7, 7), reassess the positioning towards the apple at (8, 8) or the others depending on further enemy movement.

It positions me in a spot that offers flexibility to target these apples on subsequent moves and keeps my path open.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (7, 6):\n   - This is moving away from several potential apple grabs, particularly moving away from the cluster in the top-right corner. This is not favorable at this time.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (6, 7):\n   - Moves me back, away from the nearest apples I\u2019m currently targeting. It's counterproductive as it reduces available paths to the cluster in the top-right corner.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (8, 7):\n   - Directly moving towards the apple at (8, 8). This is a strategic move, but it positions us very close to the board edge. It might limit the next move flexibility slightly but positions us optimally to grab apples quickly.\n\n### Decision\nGiven the current apple locations, and relatively safe positions ahead with no immediate threats, the **RIGHT** move still keeps the best path to approach the apple at (8, 8) directly. This will allow me a chance to secure an apple and maintain an advantageous position in the game.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (8, 7), aim to grab the apple at (8, 8). Post-consumption, evaluate the board to decide whether to aim for the apple at (8, 9) or reassess based on enemy snake's movement and available apple positions. Always maintain awareness of your position relative to the edges to avoid trapping myself.\n\n**Decided Next Move: RIGHT**"

(8, 8)\n\nMy snake's current position is (6, 6). My goal is to collide with apples to grow and avoid any hazards like the walls or the enemy snake.\n\nCurrently, I have no immediate danger from walls or the enemy snake since the board is quite large and the other snake (Snake #2) is far and without a body. \n\nNow, I'll list the possible moves and their consequences:\n\n1. **UP** - Moves to (6, 7): This move takes me one step closer to the apple at (3, 8), while still keeping some distance from the apple at (8, 8). Both of these apples are accessible that way.\n  \n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (6, 5): Moving down doesn\u2019t bring me closer to any apples, and it moves me further away from the majority of apples.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (5, 6): This move takes me away from the apples on the right side of the board, and doesn't directly target any specific apple path efficiently.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (7, 6): This moves me closer to the apple at (7, 3) as well as the apple at (8, 8).\n\nGiven this evaluation, moving **UP** seems to be a strategic move. It positions me towards two potential apples without immediately committing to one, allowing flexibility for future decisions while keeping out of immediate danger.\n\n**Next Move: UP**\n\nStrategy for next turn: Reassess the position after this move, focusing on nearer apples, and consider both available apples and the other snake's path in future decisions.

This direction keeps me at a reasonable distance from potential obstacles such as the enemy snake or the board edges.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (6, 6):\n   - Returns me back to where I came from; not advantageous in terms of apple proximity.

This move is strategic to potentially grab the apple at (8, 8) before Snake #2 gets closer to it.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (7, 7), reassess the positioning towards the apple at (8, 8) or the others depending on further enemy movement.

It positions me in a spot that offers flexibility to target these apples on subsequent moves and keeps my path open.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (7, 6):\n   - This is moving away from several potential apple grabs, particularly moving away from the cluster in the top-right corner. This is not favorable at this time.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (6, 7):\n   - Moves me back, away from the nearest apples I\u2019m currently targeting. It's counterproductive as it reduces available paths to the cluster in the top-right corner.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (8, 7):\n   - Directly moving towards the apple at (8, 8).

This will allow me a chance to secure an apple and maintain an advantageous position in the game.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (8, 7), aim to grab the apple at (8, 8). Post-consumption, evaluate the board to decide whether to aim for the apple at (8, 9) or reassess based on enemy snake's movement and available apple positions.

(8, 8)\n\nMy snake's current position is (6, 6). My goal is to collide with apples to grow and avoid any hazards like the walls or the enemy snake.\n\nCurrently, I have no immediate danger from walls or the enemy snake since the board is quite large and the other snake (Snake #2) is far and without a body. \n\nNow, I'll list the possible moves and their consequences:\n\n1. **UP** - Moves to (6, 7): This move takes me one step closer to the apple at (3, 8), while still keeping some distance from the apple at (8, 8). Both of these apples are accessible that way.\n  \n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (6, 5): Moving down doesn\u2019t bring me closer to any apples, and it moves me further away from the majority of apples.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (5, 6): This move takes me away from the apples on the right side of the board, and doesn't directly target any specific apple path efficiently.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (7, 6): This moves me closer to the apple at (7, 3) as well as the apple at (8, 8).\n\nGiven this evaluation, moving **UP** seems to be a strategic move. It positions me towards two potential apples without immediately committing to one, allowing flexibility for future decisions while keeping out of immediate danger.\n\n**Next Move: UP**\n\nStrategy for next turn: Reassess the position after this move, focusing on nearer apples, and consider both available apples and the other snake's path in future decisions.

It poses no immediate threat to me since it's far away.\n\n### Previous Move Recap\n- I moved **UP** to (6, 7) to position myself closer to the apple at (3, 8) while keeping a flexible position toward the apples at (8, 8) and (8, 9).\n\n### Possible Moves and Analysis\n\n1. **UP** - Moves to (6, 8):\n   - Bringing me closer to apple (3, 8). This direction keeps me at a reasonable distance from potential obstacles such as the enemy snake or the board edges.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (6, 6):\n   - Returns me back to where I came from; not advantageous in terms of apple proximity. Moves me away from reachable apples.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (5, 7):\n   - Doesn't directly bring me closer to any immediate apples and moves away from two of the nearest apples (8, 8) and (8, 9).\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (7, 7):\n   - Moves me closer to the apple at (8, 8) and aligns toward both apples on the top right (8, 9) and (8, 8). Given Snake #2's position at (8, 3), the path should be clear.\n\n### Decision\nConsidering the positions of the apples, I find the **RIGHT** move appealing as it will bring me directly closer to the apple at (8, 8) and keep my future options open toward a cluster of apples. This move is strategic to potentially grab the apple at (8, 8) before Snake #2 gets closer to it.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (7, 7), reassess the positioning towards the apple at (8, 8) or the others depending on further enemy movement.

However, moving to the right would require me to cross the path of enemy snake #1, which is not safe.\n\nInstead, I should move towards the apple at (0, 6), which is at the bottom of the board.

(7, 3)\n4. (8, 9)\n5. (8, 8)\n\n### Enemy Snakes\n- **Snake #2:** Positioned at (8, 2) with no current body, hence currently not a major threat.\n\n### Possible Moves and Analysis\n\n1. **UP** - Moves to (7, 8):\n   - This move aligns well with approaching the apples at both (8, 8) and (8, 9). It positions me in a spot that offers flexibility to target these apples on subsequent moves and keeps my path open.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (7, 6):\n   - This is moving away from several potential apple grabs, particularly moving away from the cluster in the top-right corner. This is not favorable at this time.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (6, 7):\n   - Moves me back, away from the nearest apples I\u2019m currently targeting. It's counterproductive as it reduces available paths to the cluster in the top-right corner.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (8, 7):\n   - Directly moving towards the apple at (8, 8). This is a strategic move, but it positions us very close to the board edge. It might limit the next move flexibility slightly but positions us optimally to grab apples quickly.\n\n### Decision\nGiven the current apple locations, and relatively safe positions ahead with no immediate threats, the **RIGHT** move still keeps the best path to approach the apple at (8, 8) directly. This will allow me a chance to secure an apple and maintain an advantageous position in the game.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (8, 7), aim to grab the apple at (8, 8). Post-consumption, evaluate the board to decide whether to aim for the apple at (8, 9) or reassess based on enemy snake's movement and available apple positions. Always maintain awareness of your position relative to the edges to avoid trapping myself.\n\n**Decided Next Move: RIGHT**"

This move is less ideal as it minimizes growth opportunities on the next turn.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Move to (7, 7):\n   - Moving away from the apples at the top-right without any strategic advantage. This also slightly isolates me from targeting apples quickly in this area.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Remain at (9, 7):\n   - This will lead to an out-of-bounds move since the board extends only up to (9,9) on the x-axis. Hence, it's an invalid move.\n\n### Decision\n\nUpon analyzing the possible moves, the **UP** move directly to (8, 8) appears to be the most strategic option as it allows me to immediately collect an apple, which is crucial for growth. This move also gives options for the subsequent turn, whether to target the apple at (8, 9) or evaluate the situation for the next best move.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (8, 8) and consuming the apple, consider going **UP** to grab the apple at (8, 9), or reassess the board for any strategic advantage or potential threats from enemy snake movements to adjust my path accordingly.\n\n**Decided Next Move: UP**"

(8, 8)\n\nMy snake's current position is (6, 6). My goal is to collide with apples to grow and avoid any hazards like the walls or the enemy snake.\n\nCurrently, I have no immediate danger from walls or the enemy snake since the board is quite large and the other snake (Snake #2) is far and without a body. \n\nNow, I'll list the possible moves and their consequences:\n\n1. **UP** - Moves to (6, 7): This move takes me one step closer to the apple at (3, 8), while still keeping some distance from the apple at (8, 8). Both of these apples are accessible that way.\n  \n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (6, 5): Moving down doesn\u2019t bring me closer to any apples, and it moves me further away from the majority of apples.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (5, 6): This move takes me away from the apples on the right side of the board, and doesn't directly target any specific apple path efficiently.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (7, 6): This moves me closer to the apple at (7, 3) as well as the apple at (8, 8).\n\nGiven this evaluation, moving **UP** seems to be a strategic move. It positions me towards two potential apples without immediately committing to one, allowing flexibility for future decisions while keeping out of immediate danger.\n\n**Next Move: UP**\n\nStrategy for next turn: Reassess the position after this move, focusing on nearer apples, and consider both available apples and the other snake's path in future decisions. Keep an eye on Snake #2 for unexpected movements but prioritize growing by targeting the closest apples where possible."

It poses no immediate threat to me since it's far away.\n\n### Previous Move Recap\n- I moved **UP** to (6, 7) to position myself closer to the apple at (3, 8) while keeping a flexible position toward the apples at (8, 8) and (8, 9).\n\n### Possible Moves and Analysis\n\n1. **UP** - Moves to (6, 8):\n   - Bringing me closer to apple (3, 8). This direction keeps me at a reasonable distance from potential obstacles such as the enemy snake or the board edges.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (6, 6):\n   - Returns me back to where I came from; not advantageous in terms of apple proximity. Moves me away from reachable apples.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (5, 7):\n   - Doesn't directly bring me closer to any immediate apples and moves away from two of the nearest apples (8, 8) and (8, 9).\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (7, 7):\n   - Moves me closer to the apple at (8, 8) and aligns toward both apples on the top right (8, 9) and (8, 8). Given Snake #2's position at (8, 3), the path should be clear.\n\n### Decision\nConsidering the positions of the apples, I find the **RIGHT** move appealing as it will bring me directly closer to the apple at (8, 8) and keep my future options open toward a cluster of apples. This move is strategic to potentially grab the apple at (8, 8) before Snake #2 gets closer to it.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (7, 7), reassess the positioning towards the apple at (8, 8) or the others depending on further enemy movement. Continue to keep an eye on Snake #2 as it may start heading toward the apple at (7, 3).\n\n**Decided Next Move: RIGHT**"

The nearest apple after (7, 3) is (3, 8), which is on the right side of the board. However, moving to the right would require me to cross the path of enemy snake #1, which is not safe.\n\nInstead, I should move towards the apple at (0, 6), which is at the bottom of the board. This move will take me away from enemy snake #1 and towards a safer part of the board.\n\nStrategy: Head towards the apple at (0, 6) after eating the apple at (7, 3).\n\nNext move: DOWN"

(7, 3)\n4. (8, 9)\n5. (8, 8)\n\n### Enemy Snakes\n- **Snake #2:** Positioned at (8, 2) with no current body, hence currently not a major threat.\n\n### Possible Moves and Analysis\n\n1. **UP** - Moves to (7, 8):\n   - This move aligns well with approaching the apples at both (8, 8) and (8, 9). It positions me in a spot that offers flexibility to target these apples on subsequent moves and keeps my path open.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (7, 6):\n   - This is moving away from several potential apple grabs, particularly moving away from the cluster in the top-right corner. This is not favorable at this time.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (6, 7):\n   - Moves me back, away from the nearest apples I\u2019m currently targeting. It's counterproductive as it reduces available paths to the cluster in the top-right corner.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (8, 7):\n   - Directly moving towards the apple at (8, 8). This is a strategic move, but it positions us very close to the board edge. It might limit the next move flexibility slightly but positions us optimally to grab apples quickly.\n\n### Decision\nGiven the current apple locations, and relatively safe positions ahead with no immediate threats, the **RIGHT** move still keeps the best path to approach the apple at (8, 8) directly. This will allow me a chance to secure an apple and maintain an advantageous position in the game.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (8, 7), aim to grab the apple at (8, 8). Post-consumption, evaluate the board to decide whether to aim for the apple at (8, 9) or reassess based on enemy snake's movement and available apple positions. Always maintain awareness of your position relative to the edges to avoid trapping myself.\n\n**Decided Next Move: RIGHT**"

(8, 8)\n\n#### Enemy Snakes\n- **Snake #2:** At (8, 1) with no body segments.\n\n### Possible Moves and Analysis\n\n1. **UP** - Move to (8, 8):\n   - Directly capture the apple at (8, 8). This move helps me grow in length immediately and positions me conveniently if I want to go for the apple at (8, 9) next.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Move to (8, 6):\n   - Moves me away from the cluster of apples at the top-right, and reduces the potential path I could take to grab other apples efficiently. This move is less ideal as it minimizes growth opportunities on the next turn.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Move to (7, 7):\n   - Moving away from the apples at the top-right without any strategic advantage. This also slightly isolates me from targeting apples quickly in this area.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Remain at (9, 7):\n   - This will lead to an out-of-bounds move since the board extends only up to (9,9) on the x-axis. Hence, it's an invalid move.\n\n### Decision\n\nUpon analyzing the possible moves, the **UP** move directly to (8, 8) appears to be the most strategic option as it allows me to immediately collect an apple, which is crucial for growth. This move also gives options for the subsequent turn, whether to target the apple at (8, 9) or evaluate the situation for the next best move.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (8, 8) and consuming the apple, consider going **UP** to grab the apple at (8, 9), or reassess the board for any strategic advantage or potential threats from enemy snake movements to adjust my path accordingly.\n\n**Decided Next Move: UP**"

(8, 8)\n\nMy snake's current position is (6, 6). My goal is to collide with apples to grow and avoid any hazards like the walls or the enemy snake.\n\nCurrently, I have no immediate danger from walls or the enemy snake since the board is quite large and the other snake (Snake #2) is far and without a body. \n\nNow, I'll list the possible moves and their consequences:\n\n1. **UP** - Moves to (6, 7): This move takes me one step closer to the apple at (3, 8), while still keeping some distance from the apple at (8, 8). Both of these apples are accessible that way.\n  \n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (6, 5): Moving down doesn\u2019t bring me closer to any apples, and it moves me further away from the majority of apples.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (5, 6): This move takes me away from the apples on the right side of the board, and doesn't directly target any specific apple path efficiently.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (7, 6): This moves me closer to the apple at (7, 3) as well as the apple at (8, 8).\n\nGiven this evaluation, moving **UP** seems to be a strategic move. It positions me towards two potential apples without immediately committing to one, allowing flexibility for future decisions while keeping out of immediate danger.\n\n**Next Move: UP**\n\nStrategy for next turn: Reassess the position after this move, focusing on nearer apples, and consider both available apples and the other snake's path in future decisions. Keep an eye on Snake #2 for unexpected movements but prioritize growing by targeting the closest apples where possible."

This direction keeps me at a reasonable distance from potential obstacles such as the enemy snake or the board edges.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (6, 6):\n   - Returns me back to where I came from; not advantageous in terms of apple proximity.

Given Snake #2's position at (8, 3), the path should be clear.\n\n### Decision\nConsidering the positions of the apples, I find the **RIGHT** move appealing as it will bring me directly closer to the apple at (8, 8) and keep my future options open toward a cluster of apples. This move is strategic to potentially grab the apple at (8, 8) before Snake #2 gets closer to it.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (7, 7), reassess the positioning towards the apple at (8, 8) or the others depending on further enemy movement.

(7, 3)\n4. (8, 9)\n5. (8, 8)\n\n### Enemy Snakes\n- **Snake #2:** Positioned at (8, 2) with no current body, hence currently not a major threat.\n\n### Possible Moves and Analysis\n\n1. **UP** - Moves to (7, 8):\n   - This move aligns well with approaching the apples at both (8, 8) and (8, 9). It positions me in a spot that offers flexibility to target these apples on subsequent moves and keeps my path open.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (7, 6):\n   - This is moving away from several potential apple grabs, particularly moving away from the cluster in the top-right corner. This is not favorable at this time.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (6, 7):\n   - Moves me back, away from the nearest apples I\u2019m currently targeting. It's counterproductive as it reduces available paths to the cluster in the top-right corner.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (8, 7):\n   - Directly moving towards the apple at (8, 8). This is a strategic move, but it positions us very close to the board edge. It might limit the next move flexibility slightly but positions us optimally to grab apples quickly.\n\n### Decision\nGiven the current apple locations, and relatively safe positions ahead with no immediate threats, the **RIGHT** move still keeps the best path to approach the apple at (8, 8) directly. This will allow me a chance to secure an apple and maintain an advantageous position in the game.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (8, 7), aim to grab the apple at (8, 8). Post-consumption, evaluate the board to decide whether to aim for the apple at (8, 9) or reassess based on enemy snake's movement and available apple positions. Always maintain awareness of your position relative to the edges to avoid trapping myself.\n\n**Decided Next Move: RIGHT**"

This move is less ideal as it minimizes growth opportunities on the next turn.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Move to (7, 7):\n   - Moving away from the apples at the top-right without any strategic advantage. This also slightly isolates me from targeting apples quickly in this area.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Remain at (9, 7):\n   - This will lead to an out-of-bounds move since the board extends only up to (9,9) on the x-axis.

However, this path also takes me near the body of Snake #2's tail at (8, 3). Care should be taken regarding their movements to avoid potentially dangerous situations, especially switching directions rapidly.\n\n### Strategy Analysis\n\n- Given my position, **DOWN** seems like a secure and strategically beneficial move as it keeps me on track towards the apple at (6, 3), maintaining my flexibility to address the changing behavior of Snake #2.\n- I should keep monitoring Snake #2, preparing to switch paths left or right depending on its next movements.\n- Consider branching near opportunities to pivot towards any unexpected open apples if advantageous.\n\n### Recommended Strategy for Next Turn\n\n- Keep heading forward towards reachable apples with a quick re-evaluation on enemy movement.\n- Stay vigilant about the positions of both enemy snakes and walls to continuously adapt accordingly.\n- Be flexible to move laterally if needed and take advantage of any unguarded apple paths.\n\n**Decided Next Move: DOWN**"

(8, 8)\n\nMy snake's current position is (6, 6). My goal is to collide with apples to grow and avoid any hazards like the walls or the enemy snake.\n\nCurrently, I have no immediate danger from walls or the enemy snake since the board is quite large and the other snake (Snake #2) is far and without a body. \n\nNow, I'll list the possible moves and their consequences:\n\n1. **UP** - Moves to (6, 7): This move takes me one step closer to the apple at (3, 8), while still keeping some distance from the apple at (8, 8). Both of these apples are accessible that way.\n  \n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (6, 5): Moving down doesn\u2019t bring me closer to any apples, and it moves me further away from the majority of apples.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (5, 6): This move takes me away from the apples on the right side of the board, and doesn't directly target any specific apple path efficiently.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (7, 6): This moves me closer to the apple at (7, 3) as well as the apple at (8, 8).\n\nGiven this evaluation, moving **UP** seems to be a strategic move. It positions me towards two potential apples without immediately committing to one, allowing flexibility for future decisions while keeping out of immediate danger.\n\n**Next Move: UP**\n\nStrategy for next turn: Reassess the position after this move, focusing on nearer apples, and consider both available apples and the other snake's path in future decisions.

This direction keeps me at a reasonable distance from potential obstacles such as the enemy snake or the board edges.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (6, 6):\n   - Returns me back to where I came from; not advantageous in terms of apple proximity.

Given Snake #2's position at (8, 3), the path should be clear.\n\n### Decision\nConsidering the positions of the apples, I find the **RIGHT** move appealing as it will bring me directly closer to the apple at (8, 8) and keep my future options open toward a cluster of apples. This move is strategic to potentially grab the apple at (8, 8) before Snake #2 gets closer to it.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (7, 7), reassess the positioning towards the apple at (8, 8) or the others depending on further enemy movement.

(7, 3)\n4. (8, 9)\n5. (8, 8)\n\n### Enemy Snakes\n- **Snake #2:** Positioned at (8, 2) with no current body, hence currently not a major threat.\n\n### Possible Moves and Analysis\n\n1. **UP** - Moves to (7, 8):\n   - This move aligns well with approaching the apples at both (8, 8) and (8, 9). It positions me in a spot that offers flexibility to target these apples on subsequent moves and keeps my path open.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (7, 6):\n   - This is moving away from several potential apple grabs, particularly moving away from the cluster in the top-right corner. This is not favorable at this time.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (6, 7):\n   - Moves me back, away from the nearest apples I\u2019m currently targeting. It's counterproductive as it reduces available paths to the cluster in the top-right corner.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (8, 7):\n   - Directly moving towards the apple at (8, 8). This is a strategic move, but it positions us very close to the board edge.

This will allow me a chance to secure an apple and maintain an advantageous position in the game.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (8, 7), aim to grab the apple at (8, 8). Post-consumption, evaluate the board to decide whether to aim for the apple at (8, 9) or reassess based on enemy snake's movement and available apple positions. Always maintain awareness of your position relative to the edges to avoid trapping myself.\n\n**Decided Next Move: RIGHT**"

This move is less ideal as it minimizes growth opportunities on the next turn.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Move to (7, 7):\n   - Moving away from the apples at the top-right without any strategic advantage. This also slightly isolates me from targeting apples quickly in this area.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Remain at (9, 7):\n   - This will lead to an out-of-bounds move since the board extends only up to (9,9) on the x-axis.

It doesn't immediately contribute to collecting apples.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Move to (7, 7):\n   - This continues to direct me toward apples, particularly aligning with (7, 3), while avoiding immediate danger and not yet clashing with Snake #2.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Move to (6, 8):\n   - This move will take me one step closer to the apple at (3, 8) as well as the apples at (6, 3). It also keeps options open to target nearby apples on the left if Snake #2 becomes a threat in its current position near (8, 3).\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Move to (8, 8):\n   - This would take me towards an apple at (8, 4), but not directly as it's blocked slightly by Snake #2 being nearby. Also, it might lead me closer to potential danger if Snake #2 moves unexpectedly.\n\n### Strategy Analysis\n\n- Given my current position and proximity to various apples, I should remain focused primarily on the closest apple strategy path, potentially the one at (7, 3) that involves heading downward.\n- While Snake #2 is a consideration, its current positioning doesn't immediately threaten any apple paths, allowing me to continue pursuing my current path without immediate diversion.\n- Maintaining flexibility in movement and considering quick pivots to the left or right if the board changes remain critical.\n\n### Recommended Strategy for Next Turn\n\nFor the next move(s), continue with a focus on lower region apples, especially:\n\n- Prioritize paths that lead directly towards immediate apple opportunities.\n- Keep a watchful eye on Snake #2's movements \u2014 in the future, ensure no collision paths.\n- Avoid board edges and consider backup escape strategies should the enemy snake move unfavorably.\n\n**Decided Next Move: DOWN**"

I need to maintain awareness of Snake #2, since it's at (7, 3), but as of now, it's still a safe path, just heading toward the lower section.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Move to (6, 7):\n   - This move shifts my position slightly closer to the apple at (6, 3). It's a valid route but crosses slightly away from the central area and may need caution in future steps to not get trapped by Snake #2 as it begins moving.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Move to (8, 7):\n   - Shifting right will guide me closer to the apple at (8, 4). However, this path also takes me near the body of Snake #2's tail at (8, 3).

(8, 8)\n\nMy snake's current position is (6, 6). My goal is to collide with apples to grow and avoid any hazards like the walls or the enemy snake.\n\nCurrently, I have no immediate danger from walls or the enemy snake since the board is quite large and the other snake (Snake #2) is far and without a body. \n\nNow, I'll list the possible moves and their consequences:\n\n1. **UP** - Moves to (6, 7): This move takes me one step closer to the apple at (3, 8), while still keeping some distance from the apple at (8, 8). Both of these apples are accessible that way.\n  \n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (6, 5): Moving down doesn\u2019t bring me closer to any apples, and it moves me further away from the majority of apples.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (5, 6): This move takes me away from the apples on the right side of the board, and doesn't directly target any specific apple path efficiently.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (7, 6): This moves me closer to the apple at (7, 3) as well as the apple at (8, 8).\n\nGiven this evaluation, moving **UP** seems to be a strategic move. It positions me towards two potential apples without immediately committing to one, allowing flexibility for future decisions while keeping out of immediate danger.\n\n**Next Move: UP**\n\nStrategy for next turn: Reassess the position after this move, focusing on nearer apples, and consider both available apples and the other snake's path in future decisions.

It positions me in a spot that offers flexibility to target these apples on subsequent moves and keeps my path open.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (7, 6):\n   - This is moving away from several potential apple grabs, particularly moving away from the cluster in the top-right corner. This is not favorable at this time.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (6, 7):\n   - Moves me back, away from the nearest apples I\u2019m currently targeting. It's counterproductive as it reduces available paths to the cluster in the top-right corner.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (8, 7):\n   - Directly moving towards the apple at (8, 8).

Given that I need to cover more distance to reach (0, 6), I think it would be better to go for the apple at (3, 8).\n\nStrategy for next turn:\n1. Move up to (6, 7).\n2. Move left to (5, 7).\n3. Move up to (5, 8).\n4. Move left to (3, 8) and eat the apple.\n\nNext move: UP."

(7, 3)\n4. (8, 9)\n5. (8, 8)\n\n### Enemy Snakes\n- **Snake #2:** Positioned at (8, 2) with no current body, hence currently not a major threat.\n\n### Possible Moves and Analysis\n\n1. **UP** - Moves to (7, 8):\n   - This move aligns well with approaching the apples at both (8, 8) and (8, 9). It positions me in a spot that offers flexibility to target these apples on subsequent moves and keeps my path open.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (7, 6):\n   - This is moving away from several potential apple grabs, particularly moving away from the cluster in the top-right corner. This is not favorable at this time.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (6, 7):\n   - Moves me back, away from the nearest apples I\u2019m currently targeting. It's counterproductive as it reduces available paths to the cluster in the top-right corner.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (8, 7):\n   - Directly moving towards the apple at (8, 8). This is a strategic move, but it positions us very close to the board edge. It might limit the next move flexibility slightly but positions us optimally to grab apples quickly.\n\n### Decision\nGiven the current apple locations, and relatively safe positions ahead with no immediate threats, the **RIGHT** move still keeps the best path to approach the apple at (8, 8) directly. This will allow me a chance to secure an apple and maintain an advantageous position in the game.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (8, 7), aim to grab the apple at (8, 8). Post-consumption, evaluate the board to decide whether to aim for the apple at (8, 9) or reassess based on enemy snake's movement and available apple positions. Always maintain awareness of your position relative to the edges to avoid trapping myself.\n\n**Decided Next Move: RIGHT**"

This move is less ideal as it minimizes growth opportunities on the next turn.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Move to (7, 7):\n   - Moving away from the apples at the top-right without any strategic advantage. This also slightly isolates me from targeting apples quickly in this area.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Remain at (9, 7):\n   - This will lead to an out-of-bounds move since the board extends only up to (9,9) on the x-axis.

(8, 8)\n\nMy snake's current position is (6, 6). My goal is to collide with apples to grow and avoid any hazards like the walls or the enemy snake.\n\nCurrently, I have no immediate danger from walls or the enemy snake since the board is quite large and the other snake (Snake #2) is far and without a body. \n\nNow, I'll list the possible moves and their consequences:\n\n1. **UP** - Moves to (6, 7): This move takes me one step closer to the apple at (3, 8), while still keeping some distance from the apple at (8, 8). Both of these apples are accessible that way.\n  \n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (6, 5): Moving down doesn\u2019t bring me closer to any apples, and it moves me further away from the majority of apples.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (5, 6): This move takes me away from the apples on the right side of the board, and doesn't directly target any specific apple path efficiently.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (7, 6): This moves me closer to the apple at (7, 3) as well as the apple at (8, 8).\n\nGiven this evaluation, moving **UP** seems to be a strategic move. It positions me towards two potential apples without immediately committing to one, allowing flexibility for future decisions while keeping out of immediate danger.\n\n**Next Move: UP**\n\nStrategy for next turn: Reassess the position after this move, focusing on nearer apples, and consider both available apples and the other snake's path in future decisions.

This direction keeps me at a reasonable distance from potential obstacles such as the enemy snake or the board edges.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (6, 6):\n   - Returns me back to where I came from; not advantageous in terms of apple proximity.

This move is strategic to potentially grab the apple at (8, 8) before Snake #2 gets closer to it.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (7, 7), reassess the positioning towards the apple at (8, 8) or the others depending on further enemy movement.

It positions me in a spot that offers flexibility to target these apples on subsequent moves and keeps my path open.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (7, 6):\n   - This is moving away from several potential apple grabs, particularly moving away from the cluster in the top-right corner. This is not favorable at this time.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (6, 7):\n   - Moves me back, away from the nearest apples I\u2019m currently targeting. It's counterproductive as it reduces available paths to the cluster in the top-right corner.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (8, 7):\n   - Directly moving towards the apple at (8, 8).

This will allow me a chance to secure an apple and maintain an advantageous position in the game.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (8, 7), aim to grab the apple at (8, 8). Post-consumption, evaluate the board to decide whether to aim for the apple at (8, 9) or reassess based on enemy snake's movement and available apple positions.

It also opens up a path to the apple at (3, 8) later if necessary. This is a safe move with strategic positioning for future apple collection.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Move to (6, 9):\n   - This move takes me slightly further from my current track towards an apple, but it aligns with the potential strategy to move closer to the horizontal path line up with (3, 8) and to gather towards lower apples from leftwards.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Move to (8, 9):\n   - This move would take me backwards towards my previous position, potentially limiting my movement in the subsequent turns.\n\n### Strategy Analysis\n\nTo maximize score potential and safety, I need a plan that balances immediate threats and long-term apple collection opportunities:\n\n- My priority should be safely aligning towards the cluster of apples primarily in the lower board region, such as (7, 3), (6, 3), and (8, 4), while strategically considering the potential detour to (3, 8) if needed.\n- I should monitor Snake #2, in case it moves closer to interfere with the nearby apples I might target.\n\n### Recommended Strategy for Next Turn\n\nFor the next move(s), I should:\n\n- Continue focusing on apples in the lower region while keeping an eye on enemy movements.\n- Anticipate and create escape options to avoid being trapped at the board's edges.\n- Maintain awareness of any new changes on the board.\n\n**Decided Next Move: DOWN**"

It doesn't immediately contribute to collecting apples.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Move to (7, 7):\n   - This continues to direct me toward apples, particularly aligning with (7, 3), while avoiding immediate danger and not yet clashing with Snake #2.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Move to (6, 8):\n   - This move will take me one step closer to the apple at (3, 8) as well as the apples at (6, 3).

(8, 8)\n\nMy snake's current position is (6, 6).

Both of these apples are accessible that way.\n  \n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (6, 5): Moving down doesn\u2019t bring me closer to any apples, and it moves me further away from the majority of apples.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (5, 6): This move takes me away from the apples on the right side of the board, and doesn't directly target any specific apple path efficiently.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (7, 6): This moves me closer to the apple at (7, 3) as well as the apple at (8, 8).\n\nGiven this evaluation, moving **UP** seems to be a strategic move.

This direction keeps me at a reasonable distance from potential obstacles such as the enemy snake or the board edges.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (6, 6):\n   - Returns me back to where I came from; not advantageous in terms of apple proximity.

Given Snake #2's position at (8, 3), the path should be clear.\n\n### Decision\nConsidering the positions of the apples, I find the **RIGHT** move appealing as it will bring me directly closer to the apple at (8, 8) and keep my future options open toward a cluster of apples. This move is strategic to potentially grab the apple at (8, 8) before Snake #2 gets closer to it.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (7, 7), reassess the positioning towards the apple at (8, 8) or the others depending on further enemy movement.

(7, 3)\n4. (8, 9)\n5. (8, 8)\n\n### Enemy Snakes\n- **Snake #2:** Positioned at (8, 2) with no current body, hence currently not a major threat.\n\n### Possible Moves and Analysis\n\n1. **UP** - Moves to (7, 8):\n   - This move aligns well with approaching the apples at both (8, 8) and (8, 9). It positions me in a spot that offers flexibility to target these apples on subsequent moves and keeps my path open.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (7, 6):\n   - This is moving away from several potential apple grabs, particularly moving away from the cluster in the top-right corner. This is not favorable at this time.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (6, 7):\n   - Moves me back, away from the nearest apples I\u2019m currently targeting. It's counterproductive as it reduces available paths to the cluster in the top-right corner.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (8, 7):\n   - Directly moving towards the apple at (8, 8).

This will allow me a chance to secure an apple and maintain an advantageous position in the game.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (8, 7), aim to grab the apple at (8, 8). Post-consumption, evaluate the board to decide whether to aim for the apple at (8, 9) or reassess based on enemy snake's movement and available apple positions. Always maintain awareness of your position relative to the edges to avoid trapping myself.\n\n**Decided Next Move: RIGHT**"

This move is less ideal as it minimizes growth opportunities on the next turn.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Move to (7, 7):\n   - Moving away from the apples at the top-right without any strategic advantage. This also slightly isolates me from targeting apples quickly in this area.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Remain at (9, 7):\n   - This will lead to an out-of-bounds move since the board extends only up to (9,9) on the x-axis.

Both of these apples are accessible that way.\n  \n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (6, 5): Moving down doesn\u2019t bring me closer to any apples, and it moves me further away from the majority of apples.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (5, 6): This move takes me away from the apples on the right side of the board, and doesn't directly target any specific apple path efficiently.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (7, 6): This moves me closer to the apple at (7, 3) as well as the apple at (8, 8).\n\nGiven this evaluation, moving **UP** seems to be a strategic move.

It positions me in a spot that offers flexibility to target these apples on subsequent moves and keeps my path open.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (7, 6):\n   - This is moving away from several potential apple grabs, particularly moving away from the cluster in the top-right corner.

This will allow me a chance to secure an apple and maintain an advantageous position in the game.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (8, 7), aim to grab the apple at (8, 8). Post-consumption, evaluate the board to decide whether to aim for the apple at (8, 9) or reassess based on enemy snake's movement and available apple positions.

This move helps me grow in length immediately and positions me conveniently if I want to go for the apple at (8, 9) next.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Move to (8, 6):\n   - Moves me away from the cluster of apples at the top-right, and reduces the potential path I could take to grab other apples efficiently. This move is less ideal as it minimizes growth opportunities on the next turn.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Move to (7, 7):\n   - Moving away from the apples at the top-right without any strategic advantage. This also slightly isolates me from targeting apples quickly in this area.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Remain at (9, 7):\n   - This will lead to an out-of-bounds move since the board extends only up to (9,9) on the x-axis. Hence, it's an invalid move.\n\n### Decision\n\nUpon analyzing the possible moves, the **UP** move directly to (8, 8) appears to be the most strategic option as it allows me to immediately collect an apple, which is crucial for growth. This move also gives options for the subsequent turn, whether to target the apple at (8, 9) or evaluate the situation for the next best move.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (8, 8) and consuming the apple, consider going **UP** to grab the apple at (8, 9), or reassess the board for any strategic advantage or potential threats from enemy snake movements to adjust my path accordingly.\n\n**Decided Next Move: UP**"

It doesn't capture an apple immediately, but positions me for future considerations.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Move to (9, 8):\n   - Leaves the current cluster of apples and has no immediate benefits.

This move keeps me well-placed at the top-right of the board where I can evaluate further moves, particularly towards the apple at (3, 8) or any shifts in enemy snake positions.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (8, 9) and consuming the apple, reflect on the overall positioning. Continue monitoring Snake #2's movements, and consider moving towards the apple at (3, 8) or preparing for a potential strategic position to anticipate further apple placements.\n\n**Decided Next Move: UP**"

(8, 8)\n\nMy snake's current position is (6, 6). My goal is to collide with apples to grow and avoid any hazards like the walls or the enemy snake.\n\nCurrently, I have no immediate danger from walls or the enemy snake since the board is quite large and the other snake (Snake #2) is far and without a body. \n\nNow, I'll list the possible moves and their consequences:\n\n1. **UP** - Moves to (6, 7): This move takes me one step closer to the apple at (3, 8), while still keeping some distance from the apple at (8, 8). Both of these apples are accessible that way.\n  \n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (6, 5): Moving down doesn\u2019t bring me closer to any apples, and it moves me further away from the majority of apples.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (5, 6): This move takes me away from the apples on the right side of the board, and doesn't directly target any specific apple path efficiently.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (7, 6): This moves me closer to the apple at (7, 3) as well as the apple at (8, 8).\n\nGiven this evaluation, moving **UP** seems to be a strategic move. It positions me towards two potential apples without immediately committing to one, allowing flexibility for future decisions while keeping out of immediate danger.\n\n**Next Move: UP**\n\nStrategy for next turn: Reassess the position after this move, focusing on nearer apples, and consider both available apples and the other snake's path in future decisions. Keep an eye on Snake #2 for unexpected movements but prioritize growing by targeting the closest apples where possible."

It positions me in a spot that offers flexibility to target these apples on subsequent moves and keeps my path open.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Moves to (7, 6):\n   - This is moving away from several potential apple grabs, particularly moving away from the cluster in the top-right corner. This is not favorable at this time.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Moves to (6, 7):\n   - Moves me back, away from the nearest apples I\u2019m currently targeting. It's counterproductive as it reduces available paths to the cluster in the top-right corner.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Moves to (8, 7):\n   - Directly moving towards the apple at (8, 8).

This will allow me a chance to secure an apple and maintain an advantageous position in the game.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (8, 7), aim to grab the apple at (8, 8). Post-consumption, evaluate the board to decide whether to aim for the apple at (8, 9) or reassess based on enemy snake's movement and available apple positions.

This move is less ideal as it minimizes growth opportunities on the next turn.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Move to (7, 7):\n   - Moving away from the apples at the top-right without any strategic advantage. This also slightly isolates me from targeting apples quickly in this area.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Remain at (9, 7):\n   - This will lead to an out-of-bounds move since the board extends only up to (9,9) on the x-axis.

(6, 3)\n\n#### Enemy Snakes\n- **Snake #2:** At (9, 1) with no body segments.\n\n### Possible Moves and Analysis\n\n1. **UP** - Move to (8, 9):\n   - Moving up captures the next apple directly to the north at (8, 9), providing immediate growth and point gain. It's a safe move as there are no immediate obstacles or enemy snakes in this position.\n\n2. **DOWN** - Move to (8, 7):\n   - This move regresses my position toward areas less clustered with apples. It doesn\u2019t capture any apples and increases the distance from other potential targets.\n\n3. **LEFT** - Move to (7, 8):\n   - This direction moves me closer to the apple at (7, 3), but slightly veers away from the apple cluster on the top side of the board. It doesn't capture an apple immediately, but positions me for future considerations.\n\n4. **RIGHT** - Move to (9, 8):\n   - Leaves the current cluster of apples and has no immediate benefits. Further, there are no apples to the right, and the edge of the board limits further decisions beyond that.\n\n### Decision\n\nThe **UP** move to (8, 9) is the most strategic choice, as it guarantees capturing an apple for immediate growth. This move keeps me well-placed at the top-right of the board where I can evaluate further moves, particularly towards the apple at (3, 8) or any shifts in enemy snake positions.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Turn\n- After moving to (8, 9) and consuming the apple, reflect on the overall positioning. Continue monitoring Snake #2's movements, and consider moving towards the apple at (3, 8) or preparing for a potential strategic position to anticipate further apple placements.\n\n**Decided Next Move: UP**"
