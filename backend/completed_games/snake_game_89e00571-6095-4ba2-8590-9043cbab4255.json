If I can make my way there without running into Snake #2 or the wall, that could be a good option.\n\nFor now, I think I'll play it safe and go for the closer apple. My strategy for next turn will be to try to position myself to go up and get the apple at (0, 4).\n\nMy decided next move is: LEFT."

Given the current positions of the apples and the enemy snake, we should aim to collect the nearest apple while ensuring we don't put ourselves in a position where we could be trapped or blocked by the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board, the nearest apple to our snake (ID: 2) at (7, 9) is at (9, 8). To get to this apple, we need to move right (increasing x) and then up (increasing y). However, we must be cautious not to move directly up into the enemy snake (ID: 1) at (1, 3).\n\nGiven the current positions, the enemy snake is not an immediate threat since it's quite far away and has no body segments that could interfere with our movement in the next few turns.\n\nThe best strategy is to move towards the apple at (9, 8) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements. If we move right first, we will be in a position to collect the apple at (9, 8) in the next turn by moving up.\n\nTherefore, the next move should be: RIGHT.\n\nFor the next turn, we should plan to move up to collect the apple at (9, 8), unless the enemy snake's movement on the next turn poses an immediate threat to our new position."
