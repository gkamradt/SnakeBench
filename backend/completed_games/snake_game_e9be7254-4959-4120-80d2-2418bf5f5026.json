The apple at (9, 9) is also far and would put me dangerously close to Snake #2.\n\nStrategy:\nGiven that Snake #2 has moved, the best course of action is to prioritize the apple at (5, 9). It's the closest apple and there are no immediate threats in the way. After obtaining this apple, I should reassess the board and consider my next target.\n\nIf for some reason the path to (5, 9) becomes blocked, the backup plan should be to head towards the apple at (1, 6). It's the next closest apple and doesn't have any obstacles in the way currently.\n\nRemember to keep an eye on Snake #2's movements and adjust the strategy accordingly to avoid collision.\n\nNext move: UP"
