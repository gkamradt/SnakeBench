However, I must ensure that my move doesn't put me in danger of colliding with the enemy snake (ID: 2) at (9, 3).\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is moving upwards (as it is positioned below its ID marker), it is not an immediate threat to my current trajectory. Therefore, the safest move is to head towards the apple at (5, 5) by moving down.\n\nNext move: DOWN\n\nFor the next turn, I will need to reassess the board state to determine the best move after collecting the apple. The strategy will be to continue collecting apples while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake and the walls."
