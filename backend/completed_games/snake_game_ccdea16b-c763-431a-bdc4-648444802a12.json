The enemy snake is at (2, 7) with no body segments.\n\nGiven the current state, I have a few options:\n\n1. Move up to (4, 10) to collect the apple at (5, 6). This would be a safe move as it doesn't put me in danger of running into a wall or the enemy snake.\n\n2. Move left to (3, 9) to collect the apple at (3, 6). This would also be a safe move.\n\n3. Move right to (5, 9) to collect the apple at (8, 8). This would also be a safe move.\n\nConsidering the options, I think the best move would be to go UP to (4, 10) to collect the apple at (5, 6). This will give me an extra point and will not put me in danger.\n\nMy next move is: UP"
