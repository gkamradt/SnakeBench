This is highly desirable as it contributes towards growth and accumulating points.\n\n**Post Apple Consumption Plan:**\nAfter securing the apple at (8, 4), the next strategic move would be to consider the vertical movement to target the cluster of apples around (8, 7), (9, 7), and (9, 8). Given the proximity, moving UP after consuming the apple at (8, 4) seems prudent to efficiently use the current position for subsequent gains.\n\n**Enemy Snake Considerations:**\n- Enemy Snake #1 remains distant and engaged along the top row, between positions (0,8) and (0,7). There is no immediate threat from this snake for our next few movements, unless it starts moving southward significantly.\n\n**Strategies and Tactical Considerations:**\n1. Remain vigilant of the enemy snake's movements, especially if it begins moving towards the center.\n2. After consuming the apple at (8, 4), plan to move UP towards (8, 7) if it remains safe\u2014this sets up a sequence for collecting further apples quickly.\n\n**Next Move Decision:**\n- Continue RIGHT to consume the apple at (8, 4) and gain an advantageous position for subsequent strategic moves. This maximizes point gains while maintaining an advantageous positioning on the board.\n\n**End of turn decision:**\n- Current move: RIGHT"

However, since going straight up is not viable due to the edge of the board, I must evaluate horizontally.\n\nMoving **LEFT to (0, 8)** would ultimately lead me back to finding an apple at (0, 7) but sidetracks my route towards the top row apples. Moving **RIGHT to (2, 8)** would also still allow for some movement but could lead to fruitless paths to get back up.\n\nHowever, considering I can't go UP, and DOWN puts me back to where I was, going **LEFT to (0, 8)** keeps me in the game and opens up options, as the apple at (0, 7) gives me points. \n\n### Next Decision\nSince I can't move up and can\u2019t go down, and right doesn\u2019t lead to any immediate gain, the best strategic option is to move to:\n**LEFT to (0, 8)** where I will align towards eventually getting (0, 7).\n\n### Decided next move\n**LEFT**"

            "rationale": "Based on the last analysis, my current position is (2, 6) after moving down. Let\u2019s evaluate my options from this new position and decide the best way to proceed.\n\n### Current State:\n- **Current Position**: (2, 6)\n- **Snake Body Size**: 2\n- **Available Apples** still include:\n  - (1, 0)\n  - (6, 2)\n  - (8, 1)\n  - (3, 3)\n  \n### Possible Moves from (2, 6):\n1. **UP to (2, 7)**: This cell is occupied by my own snake (body part at (2, 7)); I cannot move back.\n2. **DOWN to (2, 5)**: This is an open space (not occupied).\n3. **LEFT to (1, 6)**: This is an open space.\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 6)**: This cell is occupied by my own snake (body part at (3, 6)); I cannot move back.\n\n### Move Evaluation:\n- **UP**: Invalid (occupied by my snake).\n- **DOWN to (2, 5)**: An open position that allows further descent down the board.\n- **LEFT to (1, 6)**: An open position; allows lateral movement but does not seem to head towards any apples.\n- **RIGHT**: Invalid (occupied by my snake).\n\n### Strategy Considerations:\n1. **Optimal Next Move**: The most interesting choice appears to be **DOWN to (2, 5)**. This keeps me moving downwards where there may be additional space to maneuver.\n2. **Potential for Apples**: While moving down does not immediately bring me closer to an apple, I may be positioning myself to have clearer options in upcoming turns.\n3. **Creating Room**: By moving down, I can evaluate other open paths without contacting enemy snakes or backtracking into my snake\u2019s body.\n\n### Conclusion:\nBased on the analysis, moving down is a safe maneuver that keeps my future options open and avoids potential danger from the enemy snake. \n\n**Decided Next Move**: DOWN."

            "rationale": "Currently, my snake is positioned at (9, 8) after the previous move up where I consumed the apple at that position. The next closest apples are:\n\n1. (8, 1) - Down the column and then left.\n2. (6, 2) - Further away in the left and slightly upwards direction.\n3. (3, 3) - Very far to the left and down a bit.\n4. (1, 0) - The farthest to the left on the bottom.\n\nFrom my current position at (9, 8), the nearest next apple is at (8, 1). To reach this apple, I need to start moving downwards because all other directions do not contain immediate apples to collect.\n\n**Plan:**\n- I will go straight DOWN to the bottom of the current column keeping on (9, Y) axis till I reach (9, 1).\n- At (9, 1), I should plan to turn LEFT to reach (8, 1) in the next move.\n- It's critical to watch the enemy snake's movement, but as of now, it's not an immediate threat.\n\nConsidering these details, my safest and most strategic move for now is to begin moving down towards the apple at (8, 1).\n\n**Decided Next Move: DOWN**"
