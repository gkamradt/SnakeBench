Also, moves away from most apples.\n- **LEFT**: Not possible as it would collide with the wall.\n- **RIGHT** to (1, 6): This leads towards the nearest apple at (1, 5) and puts us in a good position for future moves both north and east towards other apples.\n\n**Strategy for Future**:\n- Upon moving RIGHT and consuming the apple at (1, 5) next, planning should involve evaluating the path to the densely located apples at (3, 8) and (3, 9). It might require some maneuvering to safely reach these while also watching the growth of the snake\u2019s size which could introduce some self-collision risks.\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**. This move strategically makes sense to capture the nearest apple and prep for subsequent moves towards other distant apples."
