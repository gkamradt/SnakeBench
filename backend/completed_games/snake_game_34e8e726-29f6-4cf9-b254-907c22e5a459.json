As of now, the enemy snake is at a position where it can move in any direction. It could potentially attempt to block me, or it could try to snatch up other apples. However, assuming the enemy will try to get to the closest apple first, it will probably go towards the apple at position (6,0). \n\nWith all this in mind, I will plan to move upwards to get the apple at the position (6,9). This will require me to move right first, then move upwards. \n\nNext move: RIGHT."

To reach it, the snake needs to move up and left.\n- Moving directly to (5, 5) would require two moves: UP and LEFT.\n- However, moving UP first will bring the snake closer to the apple and also closer to the next apple at (6, 0).\n\n### Decision:\n- Move UP to (7, 4) to get closer to the apple at (5, 5) and also to the apple at (6, 0).\n\nNext move: UP"
