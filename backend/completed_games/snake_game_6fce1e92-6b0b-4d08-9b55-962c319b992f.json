Right now, my potential moves from (2, 7) are:\n\n1. **UP to (2, 8)**: This location is valid, but the enemy snake (#2) is at (0, 9), so moving up could place me in a position where an enemy snake has the potential to head downward toward my row, which may become a threat if they move next.\n\n2. **DOWN to (2, 6)**: This is a valid move and takes me away from immediate danger while opening up possible moves toward apples on future turns.\n\n3. **LEFT to (1, 7)**: This is a valid move that positions me more toward the left of the board, allowing for a strategic exploration of potential apple locations. However, this doesn\u2019t directly approach an apple yet.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (3, 7)**: This would return me to my last position, which is not beneficial as it accomplishes nothing strategically.\n\n### Apple Positions\nThe apples are at (0, 2), (8, 6), (9, 3), (7, 7), and (1, 9). Given the board layout, the most feasible immediate apple is at (1, 9), which could be approached regardless of the snake threats as I can investigate if there's a safe route toward it.\n\n### Strategic Approach\nIn the next move, my main focus is to ensure I do not put myself at risk of getting trapped or targeted by an enemy snake while inching closer to the apples on future moves. Considering the immediate threat from enemy snake (#2) and the potential to head toward an apple that is an option later, I will likely prioritize moves that give me options and keep my snake safe.\n\n### Decided Move\nBased on my analysis, moving **DOWN to (2, 6)** seems the best option. This will allow me to keep an eye on future routes while ensuring I'm not putting myself in danger while staying flexible for approaching apples.\n\n**Decided Next Move: DOWN**"
