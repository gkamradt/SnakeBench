There's an apple just one square above me at (5, 3)\n\nStrategy considerations:\n- The nearest apple is directly above me at (5, 3)\n- Moving UP would collect this apple, helping me grow\n- No immediate threats from enemy snake #2\n- Board boundaries are 10x10, so moving UP is safe\n\nPotential risks:\n- No immediate risks of collision\n- Clear path to the apple\n\nThought process:\n- Collect the nearby apple\n- Simple, direct move\n- Increases my length and points\n\nNext turn strategy: After collecting this apple, I'll look for the next closest apple and navigate towards it.\n\nDecided next move: UP"
