            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (1,7). There are apples at (8,7), (3,7), (1,9), (4,9), and (9,2). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (2,7) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . A . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . 2 1 A . . . . A .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, at row 7, column 1 is my head at (1,7), and next to me at (2,7) is the enemy snake's head. There's an apple at (3,7) in the same row, and another at (8,7). There are also apples at (1,9), (4,9), and (9,2).\n\nI need to think about how to approach this. My main goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider the immediate surroundings. I'm at (1,7), with the enemy at (2,7). If I move right to (2,7), I'll collide with the enemy and die. So, moving right is not safe.\n\nWhat if I move left to (0,7)? Let's see, that's within the board limits, and there's nothing there according to the board state. So, that might be safe.\n\nAlternatively, I can move up to (1,8) or down to (1,6). Let's check those.\n\nRow 8 is all dots, so (1,8) seems safe. Row 6 is also all dots, so (1,6) is safe as well.\n\nSo, possible moves: left to (0,7), up to (1,8), or down to (1,6).\n\nBut I need to think longer term. If I just move left to (0,7), I'll be blocked by the wall on the left, and I don't see any apples in that direction immediately. Similarly, moving down to (1,6) doesn't get me closer to any apples soon.\n\nMoving up to (1,8) might be better because there's a possibility of getting to the apple at (1,9), but it's not immediately adjacent.\n\nAlternatively, if I could get to row 7, where there are multiple apples, that might be beneficial.\n\nBut considering the enemy is at (2,7), if I move left to (0,7), I can start moving up towards (0,8) and then across to the apples.\n\nWait, but I need to consider if the enemy is moving. If the enemy is also trying to get to the apples, it might move left towards me or elsewhere.\n\nAssuming the enemy is trying to get to the apples as well, I need to plan a path that avoids collision.\n\nLet me think about the apples. There are apples at (8,7), (3,7), (1,9), (4,9), and (9,2). So, multiple apples in row 7 and row 9, and one at (9,2).\n\nI need to prioritize which apple to go for first. Maybe go for the closest one.\n\nI'm at (1,7), and there's an apple at (3,7), which is two steps to the right. But the enemy is at (2,7), so if I try to go right, I might collide with it.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (1,9), which is two rows up.\n\nMaybe I should aim for (1,9) first.\n\nSo, move up to (1,8), then (1,9) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy isn't also going for that apple.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (2,7), and if it tries to go up to (2,8) and then (2,9), I can try to get to (1,9) first.\n\nSo, maybe moving up to (1,8) is a good first step.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for the apple at (3,7) by moving right, but that's risky because of the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can try to go for the apple at (1,9), then go down to row 7 and get the apples there.\n\nLet me think about the sequence.\n\nMove up to (1,8), then (1,9) to eat the apple at (1,9).\n\nThen, move down to (1,8), then (1,7), and then right to (2,7), but the enemy is there, so that might not be safe.\n\nAlternatively, after eating (1,9), I can move right to (2,9), then (3,9), etc., to get other apples.\n\nBut looking at the board, there are no apples in row 9 except at (1,9) and (4,9).\n\nSo, after eating (1,9), I can move right to (2,9), then (3,9), but there's no apple there. Then (4,9) has an apple.\n\nSo, path: (1,7) -> (1,8) -> (1,9) [eat] -> (2,9) -> (3,9) -> (4,9) [eat]\n\nThen, from (4,9), I can move down to row 7 to get the apples there.\n\nBut I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nWait, but moving from (4,9) down to row 7 might take me across the board, and I need to plan a path that avoids collisions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (9,2), which is way down at (9,2).\n\nThat might be too far, and I might get intercepted by the enemy.\n\nHmm.\n\nLet me consider the distances.\n\nFrom (1,7), the apple at (3,7) is 2 steps right.\n\nBut with the enemy at (2,7), moving right is risky.\n\nThe apple at (1,9) is 2 steps up.\n\nThe apple at (8,7) is 7 steps right.\n\nThe apple at (4,9) is 3 steps right and 2 steps up.\n\nThe apple at (9,2) is 7 steps down and 8 steps right.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (3,7), but it's risky due to the enemy.\n\nNext closest is at (1,9), which is 2 steps up.\n\nMaybe I should go for (1,9) first.\n\nAfter eating (1,9), I can consider going to (4,9), then to (8,7), and so on.\n\nBut I need to think about the enemy's possible moves.\n\nIf the enemy is at (2,7), and it tries to go for the apple at (3,7), it would move right to (3,7).\n\nBut if I go up to (1,8), then (1,9), the enemy might not interfere immediately.\n\nThen, after I eat (1,9), I can move right to (2,9), then (3,9), (4,9) to eat that apple.\n\nThen, from (4,9), I can move down to (4,8), (4,7), then right to (5,7), (6,7), etc., to get to (8,7).\n\nBut I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider going for the apple at (9,2), but that seems too far.\n\nSo, perhaps the best strategy is to go for the apple at (1,9), then (4,9), then (8,7), and finally (9,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy or myself.\n\nWait, also, I need to consider that as I eat apples, I grow in length.\n\nSo, after eating (1,9), my tail will extend, and I need to make sure I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut since I'm just starting, my tail is short.\n\nWait, actually, my snake is just the head at (1,7), so after eating an apple, I'll have a body part at (1,7), and my head at (1,8), then (1,9).\n\nThen, moving from (1,9) to (2,9), my tail will move from (1,7) to (1,"
