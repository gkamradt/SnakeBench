My position is secure and allows freedom of maneuver.\n\nBy considering the strategic positioning and the need to reach other apples, even while minimizing the potential for running into walls or the enemy, **moving LEFT to (0, 8) seems the most appropriate choice**.\n\n### Decision for Immediate Next Move:\nLEFT to (0, 8) \n\nEnd of strategy and decided next move: **LEFT**."

My position is secure and allows freedom of maneuver.\n\nBy considering the strategic positioning and the need to reach other apples, even while minimizing the potential for running into walls or the enemy, **moving LEFT to (0, 8) seems the most appropriate choice**.\n\n### Decision for Immediate Next Move:\nLEFT to (0, 8) \n\nEnd of strategy and decided next move: **LEFT**."

I've just decided to move DOWN to (1, 8) to collect an apple. \n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves After Collecting Apple:\n\nAfter moving LEFT to (1, 8) and collecting the apple, I will be considering the following moves:\n\n- **LEFT to (0, 8)**: This is valid but leads me away from any immediate apples. \n- **RIGHT to (2, 8)**: This is reversing my move, which I cannot do.\n- **UP to (1, 9)**: This move is out of bounds, as the board only goes up to 9.\n- **DOWN to (1, 7)**: This leads back to my previous position, which is a reverse move and not allowed.\n\nGiven these choices, **the only valid moves after collecting the apple at (1, 8) are LEFT to (0, 8) or down back to (1, 7)**. However, since going back to (1, 7) does not yield anything beneficial, I need to consider leaving that position.\n\n### Goal Analysis:\n\n1. **Next Moves**:\n   - Moving LEFT to (0, 8) puts me in a tight spot with limited options. I can only then go DOWN to (0, 7) next, continuing to move down along column 0.\n   - The alternative is DOWN to (1, 7), however this doesn't grant advancement toward collecting another apple.\n\n2. **Better Strategy**: Moving LEFT to (0, 8) leads to further moves downwards (0, 7) and potentially facing an apple at (1, 1) in upcoming moves straight down to the bottom of my current column.\n\n### Current Threat:\nThe only enemy snake at (2, 5) remains distant. My position is secure and allows freedom of maneuver.\n\nBy considering the strategic positioning and the need to reach other apples, even while minimizing the potential for running into walls or the enemy, **moving LEFT to (0, 8) seems the most appropriate choice**.\n\n### Decision for Immediate Next Move:\nLEFT to (0, 8) \n\nEnd of strategy and decided next move: **LEFT**."

(7, 1)\n2. (9, 7)\n3. (8, 3)\n4. (1, 1) (adjacent to enemy snake)\n\n### Enemy Snake Position\n- Snake #2 is at position (1, 1) with body at [(1, 2)]. There is a potential danger if I move too close to the enemy snake, particularly after its next move, which could threaten my position.\n\n### Analysis of Possible Moves\nFrom my current position (2, 5), the possible moves are:\n1. **LEFT to (1, 5)**: This space is safe; however, it doesn't help me move towards any apples or an advantageous position.\n2. **RIGHT to (3, 5)**: This space is safe and allows me to move further without limitation, also keeping options available for the next moves.\n3. **UP to (2, 6)**: This space is empty and safe, allowing me to potentially access the upper rows in future turns.\n4. **DOWN to (2, 4)**: This space is occupied by my own body and is therefore invalid.\n\n### Decision Making\nBased on the analysis:\n- **LEFT (to 1, 5)**: Could be strategically safe but doesn't progress toward the apples.\n- **RIGHT (to 3, 5)**: Opens up options further toward the right where more empty space exists and keeps me further from the enemy snake.\n- **UP (to 2, 6)**: A safe option but doesn't approach apples immediately.\n\nSince the enemy snake\u2019s immediate threat is at (1, 1), I want to ensure that I do not move closer to its position. Therefore:\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn\nMy next move should be to maintain a safe distance from the enemy snake and head towards areas that allow access to the apples either on the right or in the upper rows. Moving **RIGHT to (3, 5)** continues to keep my options open while heading away from enemy threats and towards more potential apple opportunities.\n\n**Decided Next Move**: RIGHT."
