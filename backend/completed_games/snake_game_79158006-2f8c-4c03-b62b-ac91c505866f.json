The enemy snake is close, so I need to be conscious of potential movement paths that could intersect.\n\n**3. Possible Moves:**\n1. **UP to (6, 4):**\n   - This move immediately leads me to an apple. It's a straightforward, beneficial move since it involves collecting an apple, which grows my snake and increases my score. \n   \n2. **DOWN to (6, 2):**\n   - Moves away from the apples and doesn\u2019t align with my goal of collecting as many apples as quickly as possible.\n\n3. **LEFT to (5, 3):**\n   - This position is occupied by Snake #2's head, which means moving left would result in a collision and my elimination.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 3):**\n   - Takes me away from the apple clusters and doesn't contribute towards my apple collection goals.\n\n**4. Strategic Decision:**\n- **UP to (6, 4):** This is the most advantageous move as I'll collect the apple, grow, and still remain in a favorable position to aim for the next set of apples at (5, 4), (5, 5), or (4, 5).\n\n**5. Strategy for Next Turn:**\n- After moving to (6, 4), I'll assess the proximity of Snake #2 again. Ideally, I\u2019ll aim for the apple at (5, 5) next, if still clear, by moving LEFT, but keeping other developments in mind.\n\n**Next Move:**\n- UP"

If I try to move right now, I'm going to collide into the enemy snake, and the game will be over. Following rule number 2.\n\nMy options now seem to be to either move up, down, or left. If I move down, that will just take me further away from the apples, so let's rule that out. If I move to the left, I will be safe, but again, that just takes me further away from the apples.\n\nSo, going up seems to be the most logical decision here. Moving up to (5,4), will allow me to reach the apple at (5,5) on the following turn. Meanwhile, this move also puts me one step farther from the enemy snake, which is always a good thing. \n\nSo, the plan here is to move up and then keep an eye out for the enemy snake.
