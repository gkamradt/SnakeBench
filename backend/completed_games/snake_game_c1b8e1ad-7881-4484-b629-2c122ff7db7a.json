I have 5 apples to aim for, and I need to get as many as I can to increase my score.\n\nMy first thought is to head towards the nearest apple, which is at position (7, 2). However, I need to avoid running into the wall or another snake. I can see that Snake #1 is at position (6, 7), so I'll need to steer clear of that area.\n\nI think I'll head up to (0, 1) first, which is a safe distance from the wall and the other snake. From there, I can reassess my options and decide which direction to head next.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn is to try to get as close to the apple at (7, 2) as possible while avoiding any potential dangers.\n\nMy next move: UP."
