From here:\n  - Moving UP would hit the wall at y coordinate 10.\n  - Moving DOWN would bring you to (2, 8), which is safe.\n  - Moving LEFT would bring you to (1, 9), which is safe.\n  - Moving RIGHT would bring you to (3, 9), which is safe.\n\n**Apple Proximity**:\n- The apples are located at (5, 6), (8, 2), (0, 2), (6, 8), (7, 8).\n- The closest reachable apple from your current direction possibilities without hitting a wall are:\n  - (6, 8) and (7, 8): These are up from your current position.\n\n**Strategy**:\n- Moving DOWN first seems to be a safer choice since UP is not an option currently, and moving LEFT or RIGHT requires additional turns later to reach an apple. Going DOWN initially will keep your options open for the next turns, either to move left towards (6, 8) and (7, 8) apples by subsequent LEFT and UP movements or even navigating farther down for a change in strategy next.\n  \n**Next Move**:\n- Given the immediate options and the avoidance of danger, your best move currently would be to go DOWN. This move avoids any negative consequences and starts positioning you in a potential path toward the bottom-left apple or allows you to curve back UP towards the upper-left apples once safely positioned.\n\n**Decided Next Move**:\n- DOWN."

Planning a path towards these apples is ideal as they are only a few movements away.\n- The other apples are at: (5, 6), (8, 2), (0, 2), all further away and not beneficial to focus on for immediate gains.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Continue focusing on approaching the apples at (6, 8), and (7, 8) because of their proximity.\n- Since moving UP eventually leads to a wall, and DOWN moves you away from nearby apples, strategically positioning RIGHT to move closer in the horizontal axis towards (6, 8) and (7, 8) is the optimal choice.\n\n**Next Move:**\n- Moving RIGHT seems the most beneficial, offering a safe path and gradually moving towards two close apples.

These two apples are excellent targets to secure easily accessible points and possibly hinder the approach of Snake #2 from capturing them.\n\n**Strategy:**\n- Continuing to focus on a more aggressive play by moving towards the apples at (6, 8) and (7, 8) seems beneficial. As the enemy snake #2 at (8, 8) may also be interested in these apples, gaining these points quickly could provide a significant advantage.\n- Ensure to keep an eye on Snake #2's movements and adapt the strategy accordingly to avoid collisions.\n\n**Next Move:**\n- Moving RIGHT once more remains advantageous due to both proximity to critical objectives (apples) and maintaining a safe distance from the enemy. Post securing apples, the direction can be reassessed based on new positions and available routes.\n\n**Decided Next Move:**\n- RIGHT."
