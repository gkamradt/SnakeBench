This move increases my distance from Snake #2 while also bringing me closer to the next apple.\n\nNext move: UP\n\nStrategy for the next turn:\nAfter moving UP, I will re-evaluate the positions of the remaining apples and Snake #2's movement. If Snake #2 starts moving towards me, I may need to prioritize creating more distance between us.
