That's a good target.  Moving up is the safest and most direct path to a potential apple.  Enemy snake 1 is at (1, 1), which is far away.\n\nStrategy for next turn:  Prioritize moving towards visible apples.  If no apples are directly reachable, move in a direction that avoids collisions with walls and other snakes.\n\nNext move: UP"
