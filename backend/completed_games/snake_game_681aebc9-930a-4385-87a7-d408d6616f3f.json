(1, 4) - Somewhat close but requires navigating through or around the enemy snake #2.\n2. (2, 5) - Similar approach route as the first but needs careful maneuvering to avoid snake #2.\n3. (2, 8) - Farther away, same vertical line as one of the closer apples.\n4.

Attempting to reach it first invites a high risk of collision especially if snake #2 turns upward.\n- The apple at (1, 4) requires moving UP and then LEFT, avoiding direct paths with snake #2.\n- The route to (2, 5) also involves going UP and then potentially LEFT. Since it's only one position towards the right of the previous apple, it is safer to consider it later.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- Continuing to move UP allows me to maintain distance from snake #2 while aligning myself with several apples for future moves.\n- After moving UP, I can reassess the situation on the next turn, possibly moving LEFT or RIGHT depending on snake #2's position.\n\nNext move planning:\n- By continuing UP this turn, I can better align for an approach to (1, 4) or possibly (2, 5) depending on the movements of snake #2.\n- I need to remain vigilant about snake #2 potentially moving towards any apples and adjust my movement strategy accordingly.\n\nConclusion:\nGiven my current analysis and the positions of risk factors, moving UP again this turn maximizes my opportunities for safe apple acquisition while keeping a buffer distance from snake #2.

(8, 5) and (3, 3) - These seem risky due to proximity to snake #2's current trajectory.\n\nImmediate analysis:\n- The apple at (3, 3) is directly in the line of snake #2. Attempting to reach it first invites a high risk of collision especially if snake #2 turns upward.\n- The apple at (1, 4) requires moving UP and then LEFT, avoiding direct paths with snake #2.\n- The route to (2, 5) also involves going UP and then potentially LEFT. Since it's only one position towards the right of the previous apple, it is safer to consider it later.\n\nStrategic considerations:\n- Continuing to move UP allows me to maintain distance from snake #2 while aligning myself with several apples for future moves.\n- After moving UP, I can reassess the situation on the next turn, possibly moving LEFT or RIGHT depending on snake #2's position.\n\nNext move planning:\n- By continuing UP this turn, I can better align for an approach to (1, 4) or possibly (2, 5) depending on the movements of snake #2.\n- I need to remain vigilant about snake #2 potentially moving towards any apples and adjust my movement strategy accordingly.\n\nConclusion:\nGiven my current analysis and the positions of risk factors, moving UP again this turn maximizes my opportunities for safe apple acquisition while keeping a buffer distance from snake #2. This movement aligns with strategic positioning for future nourishments and keeps options open for rapid direction shifts based on enemy movement.\n\nNext move: UP"

While safe now, could limit future movements north or south without approaching boundaries or changing course dramatically.\n2. **LEFT** to (7, 4): returns towards previously traveled territory. Might offer safer operation if other paths provide direct risk.\n3. **UP** to (8, 5): moves towards the center of the board vertically and this space is likely empty and safe at the moment.\n4. **DOWN** to (8, 3): also potentially safe but moves the snake back toward the lower boundary of the board.\n\n**Nearby Apples:**\nChecking for nearby apples is vital:\n- (1, 1), (0, 1), (4, 6), and (3, 0) are present on the board. \n- Among these, (4, 6) could potentially become a strategically important target due to its more central location and despite the possible risk of moving across the board length.\n\n**Strategy for This Turn:**\n- The priority is maintaining flexibility in movement while avoiding risk areas.

This move optimizes both safety from snake #2 and future apple collection strategies.\n- Post this move, potential moves are LEFT to (1, 4) apple or further UP towards other targets while observing enemy movements.\n\nFuture Strategy Reminder:\nKeep watch on snake #2's direction next turn to adapt and ensure safe pathways towards the nearest apples.\n\nDecision:\nNext move: UP"

However, it's further away from any immediate apples.\n4. **DOWN** to (7, 5): This would mean reverting to a previous position which is tactically redundant and doesn't align well with the aim of covering new ground or approaching apples.\n\n**Immediate Objective**:\nWith the closest apple on (4, 6), a strategic advancement could be to move horizontally leftwards towards it to secure it quickly before the enemy can adjust their own position to interrupt.\n\n**Considerations**:\nGiven the enemy snake's last known trajectory and positions, they are fairly distant and occupied with their own local apples and threats. This lessens the immediate pressure on specific defensive maneuvers and allows a more aggressive approach toward securing apples.\n\n**Strategic Decision**:\nPrioritize closer proximity to the nearest apple while maintaining flexible movement capabilities. Moving LEFT seems sensible, reducing the Y-coordinate return to a previous vertical line but now in pursuit of the nearest apple at (4, 6).\n\n**Next Turn Strategy Reminder**:\nAfter moving LEFT towards the apple, assess the move's result\u2014whether it allows for a subsequent beneficial move down to secure the apple or if repositioning is required due to enemy movement or other emerging factors.\n\n**Decided Next Move**: LEFT."

Thus, maintaining an upward trajectory is preferred for safety and strategic approach to apples.\n- Position (4, 4) does not immediately procure an apple but sets up for a safer subsequent move either LEFT or more UP.\n\nNext Move Thought Process:\n- Continue UP to (4, 4). This move optimizes both safety from snake #2 and future apple collection strategies.\n- Post this move, potential moves are LEFT to (1, 4) apple or further UP towards other targets while observing enemy movements.\n\nFuture Strategy Reminder:\nKeep watch on snake #2's direction next turn to adapt and ensure safe pathways towards the nearest apples.\n\nDecision:\nNext move: UP"

(1, 4) - Somewhat close but requires navigating through or around the enemy snake #2.\n2. (2, 5) - Similar approach route as the first but needs careful maneuvering to avoid snake #2.\n3. (2, 8) - Farther away, same vertical line as one of the closer apples.\n4.

It is the shortest route to the next apple without any significant danger present from nearby enemies or obstacles.\n\n3. **LEFT** (2, 3): Moving left brings the snake closer to the enemy snake, posing a danger of collision.
