            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (4,5). There are apples at (0,5), (5,5), (3,7), (7,3), and (1,1). Oh, and there's an enemy snake number 1 at (9,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . 2 A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . A . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (4,5), which is in row 5, column 4.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (0,5): row 5, column 0\n\n- (5,5): row 5, column 5\n\n- (3,7): row 7, column 3\n\n- (7,3): row 3, column 7\n\n- (1,1): row 1, column 1\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (9,1), which is row 1, column 9.\n\nOkay, I need to think about which apple to go for. I should consider which one is closest and which one poses the least risk.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\nTo (0,5):\n\nDistance = |4-0| + |5-5| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nTo (5,5):\n\nDistance = |4-5| + |5-5| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nTo (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |5-7| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nTo (7,3):\n\nDistance = |4-7| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nTo (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5), only 1 step away.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if there are any obstacles or enemies in that direction.\n\nLooking at the board, (5,5) is right next to me, to my right.\n\nIs there any part of my snake or the enemy snake there? From the board, it's just an apple, so it should be safe to move there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. But since I'm currently just the head at (4,5), my new position would be (5,5), and my tail would be at (4,5).\n\nNow, what's next? There are still apples at (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), and (1,1).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to eat as many apples as possible without running into walls, enemies, or myself.\n\nLet's think about the positions:\n\nFrom (5,5), I can see the apple at (0,5) is directly to my left, 5 steps away.\n\nThe apple at (3,7) is up and to the left.\n\n(7,3) is down and to the right.\n\n(1,1) is down and to the left.\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake at (9,1). I should keep an eye on its movement, but since it's only the head with no body parts, it might be less threatening for now.\n\nBut in this turn, I need to decide where to go.\n\nOption 1: Go right to (5,5), eat the apple, then plan to go left towards (0,5).\n\nOption 2: Go up towards (3,7).\n\nOption 3: Go down towards (7,3) or (1,1).\n\nHmm.\n\nGoing right to (5,5) seems straightforward, as it's only one step away.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can consider moving left towards (0,5).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), moving left to (4,5) is my tail, which is now at (4,5) after I eat the apple at (5,5).\n\nWait, no. After eating the apple at (5,5), my head moves to (5,5), and my tail remains at (4,5). So, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) would be moving into my own tail, which would cause me to die.\n\nOh no, that's a problem.\n\nSo, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (5,5), because my tail is there.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail extends, so your tail remains where it was, and you grow by one segment.\n\nSo, in this case, after eating the apple at (5,5), my body would be:\n\nHead at (5,5), previous head at (4,5).\n\nSo, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) would be moving into my own body, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (5,5).\n\nSo, maybe I should consider another direction.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,5), I can move up or down.\n\nLet's see:\n\nMoving up from (5,5) to (5,6). Is there anything there? From the board, it's empty.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can continue up to (5,7), where there's an apple at (3,7), but that's not directly up.\n\nWait, (3,7) is at column 3, row 7.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving up to (5,6), then (5,7), but that's column 5, row 7.\n\nThe apple is at column 3, row 7.\n\nSo, I would need to move left from (5,7) to (4,7), then to (3,7) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (0,5), but as we saw, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) is into my own body.\n\nSo, maybe I should move right from (5,5) to (6,5).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), move right to (6,5), which is empty.\n\nThen, I can continue moving left back to (5,5), then (4,5), but wait, my tail would be moving, so I need to be careful.\n\nActually, in Snake games, each move advances the head and the tail moves to where the previous head was.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (5,5), my body is now two segments: head at (5,5), and tail at (4,5).\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), my new body would be head at (6,5), and previous head at (5,5).\n\nThen, if I move left to (5,5), I'm moving into my own body, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, no. In Snake, you can't move back to the previous position immediately, because your tail is there.\n\nBut in this case, after eating the apple, my body is head at (5,5), and tail at (4,5).\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), then my body becomes head at (6,5), and tail at (5,5).\n\nThen, if I move left to (5,5), I'm moving into my tail, which is now at (5,5).\n\nSo, that's still not allowed.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need to choose a different path.\n\nMaybe I should consider moving up from (5,5) to (5,6), then (5,7), then left to (4,7), then (3,7) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, rows 6 and 7 seem empty in column 5.\n\nSo, from (5,5), up to (5,6), then (5,7), then left to (4,7), then (3,7) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (7,3), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,5), down to (5,4), then (5,3), then right to"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at positions (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (5,5). There's an enemy snake, ID 1, at (8,1) with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout based on the given state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . T 2 . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . A . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 0: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (5,5), which is row 5, column 5. The 'T' might represent the tail, but since I just started, maybe it's just notation. There's an apple at (0,5), which is in the same row but column 0.\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are several factors to consider:\n\n1. **Proximity**: Which apple is closest to my current position.\n\n2. **Safety**: Ensuring I don't run into walls, enemy snakes, or myself.\n\n3. **Future Path**: Planning a path that allows me to pick up multiple apples efficiently.\n\nLet's list out the distances to each apple using Manhattan distance, which is suitable for grid movements without diagonals.\n\n- To (0,5): |5-0| + |5-5| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n- To (3,7): |5-3| + |5-7| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (7,3): |5-7| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (1,1): |5-1| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- To (2,0): |5-2| + |5-0| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (3,7) and (7,3), both with a distance of 4.\n\nBut wait, there's also an apple at (0,5) which is distance 5, and another at (5,5), which seems to be where I am now. Wait, the board shows an 'A' at (0,5) and (5,5), and 'T' and '2' at (5,5). Maybe there's confusion in notation.\n\nLooking back, the board shows:\n\nRow 5: A . . . T 2 . . . .\n\nSo, 'A' at column 0, 'T' and '2' at column 5. Probably 'T' is the tail, and '2' is my head.\n\nSo, there is an apple at (0,5) and another at (5,5), where I am now. Wait, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple there, do I automatically eat it by staying put? Probably not; I need to move to a new cell to eat the apple.\n\nHmm, maybe the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto that cell to eat it.\n\nBut if I'm already there, perhaps I need to move onto it in my next move.\n\nWait, in Snake games, you move to an adjacent cell to eat the apple.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple at (5,5), maybe I need to move onto it, which would extend my snake.\n\nBut in reality, in Snake games, the apple is on the cell you move into, and eating it makes your snake longer.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple at (5,5), moving onto (5,5) would make me eat the apple and grow.\n\nBut, if I'm already on (5,5), maybe I need to move to an adjacent cell to eat the apple.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nBut in this setup, I'm at (5,5), and the apple is also at (5,5). Maybe the board notation is confusing.\n\nLet's assume that moving onto (5,5) from my current position would make me eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple is at (0,5) and (5,5), and I'm at (5,5).\n\nIn that case, moving onto (5,5) would make me eat the apple.\n\nBut, in Snake games, you can't stay in the same place; you must move to an adjacent cell.\n\nSo, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet's look back at the board:\n\nRow 5: A . . . T 2 . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, 'A' at (0,5), 'T' at (4,5), '2' at (5,5).\n\nSo, apple at (0,5), my tail at (4,5), and head at (5,5).\n\nWait, but according to the initial information, my snake is at (5,5), and the apple is also at (5,5). There might be a mismatch in notation.\n\nTo clarify:\n\n- My snake is at (5,5).\n\n- There is an apple at (5,5).\n\n- My tail is at (4,5).\n\nSo, if I move to (5,5), I should eat the apple and grow.\n\nBut in Snake games, moving onto the apple extends the snake by one segment.\n\nTherefore, if I move onto the apple at (5,5), my snake grows, and my tail remains where it was.\n\nWait, no. When you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail stays in place, and your head moves to the new cell.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and I move to (5,5), that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nBut I'm already on (5,5). Maybe the apple is still there, and moving onto it counts as eating it.\n\nIn that case, moving to (5,5) from (5,5) doesn't make sense because I can't stay in place.\n\nSo, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nBut I'm already on (5,5), so maybe I need to move to another adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the apple is at (5,5), and moving onto it from an adjacent cell allows me to eat it.\n\nBut since I'm already on (5,5), perhaps I need to move to another cell to eat it.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple remains until I move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nI think I need to clarify the rules of this specific Snake game.\n\nAssuming that moving onto the apple from an adjacent cell causes me to eat it, and since I'm already on (5,5), maybe I need to move to (5,5) from an adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nBut that seems odd because I'm already on (5,5).\n\nMaybe the apple disappears once I'm on it, or perhaps I need to move onto it from a different direction to eat it.\n\nTo simplify, perhaps I should consider that moving onto (5,5) from an adjacent cell allows me to eat the apple.\n\nGiven that, I need to move to (5,5) from, say, (4,5), to eat the apple.\n\nBut I'm already at (5,5), so maybe I need to move to another adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should consider the apple at (5,5) as already eaten or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are two apples: one at (0,5) and one at (5,5).\n\nLooking back, the initial information says apples are at (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0).\n\nBut the board shows an 'A' at (0,5) and (5,5), and 'T' and '2' at (5,5).\n\nMaybe there's only one apple at (0,5), and I'm at (5,5) with 'T' and '2' overlapping.\n\nThis is unclear. Perhaps I should proceed with the list of apple positions:"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (4,5). There are apples at (0,5), (5,5), (3,7), (7,3), and (1,1). Oh, and there's an enemy snake number 1 at (9,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . 2 A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . A . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (4,5), which is in row 5, column 4.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (0,5): row 5, column 0\n\n- (5,5): row 5, column 5\n\n- (3,7): row 7, column 3\n\n- (7,3): row 3, column 7\n\n- (1,1): row 1, column 1\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (9,1), which is row 1, column 9.\n\nOkay, I need to think about which apple to go for. I should consider which one is closest and which one poses the least risk.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\nTo (0,5):\n\nDistance = |4-0| + |5-5| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nTo (5,5):\n\nDistance = |4-5| + |5-5| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nTo (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |5-7| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nTo (7,3):\n\nDistance = |4-7| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nTo (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5), only 1 step away.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if there are any obstacles or enemies in that direction.\n\nLooking at the board, (5,5) is right next to me, to my right.\n\nIs there any part of my snake or the enemy snake there? From the board, it's just an apple, so it should be safe to move there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. But since I'm currently just the head at (4,5), my new position would be (5,5), and my tail would be at (4,5).\n\nNow, what's next? There are still apples at (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), and (1,1).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to eat as many apples as possible without running into walls, enemies, or myself.\n\nLet's think about the positions:\n\nFrom (5,5), I can see the apple at (0,5) is directly to my left, 5 steps away.\n\nThe apple at (3,7) is up and to the left.\n\n(7,3) is down and to the right.\n\n(1,1) is down and to the left.\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake at (9,1). I should keep an eye on its movement, but since it's only the head with no body parts, it might be less threatening for now.\n\nBut in this turn, I need to decide where to go.\n\nOption 1: Go right to (5,5), eat the apple, then plan to go left towards (0,5).\n\nOption 2: Go up towards (3,7).\n\nOption 3: Go down towards (7,3) or (1,1).\n\nHmm.\n\nGoing right to (5,5) seems straightforward, as it's only one step away.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can consider moving left towards (0,5).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), moving left to (4,5) is my tail, which is now at (4,5) after I eat the apple at (5,5).\n\nWait, no. After eating the apple at (5,5), my head moves to (5,5), and my tail remains at (4,5). So, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) would be moving into my own tail, which would cause me to die.\n\nOh no, that's a problem.\n\nSo, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (5,5), because my tail is there.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail extends, so your tail remains where it was, and you grow by one segment.\n\nSo, in this case, after eating the apple at (5,5), my body would be:\n\nHead at (5,5), previous head at (4,5).\n\nSo, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) would be moving into my own body, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (5,5).\n\nSo, maybe I should consider another direction.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,5), I can move up or down.\n\nLet's see:\n\nMoving up from (5,5) to (5,6). Is there anything there? From the board, it's empty.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can continue up to (5,7), where there's an apple at (3,7), but that's not directly up.\n\nWait, (3,7) is at column 3, row 7.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving up to (5,6), then (5,7), but that's column 5, row 7.\n\nThe apple is at column 3, row 7.\n\nSo, I would need to move left from (5,7) to (4,7), then to (3,7) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (0,5), but as we saw, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) is into my own body.\n\nSo, maybe I should move right from (5,5) to (6,5).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), move right to (6,5), which is empty.\n\nThen, I can continue moving left back to (5,5), then (4,5), but wait, my tail would be moving, so I need to be careful.\n\nActually, in Snake games, each move advances the head and the tail moves to where the previous head was.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (5,5), my body is now two segments: head at (5,5), and tail at (4,5).\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), my new body would be head at (6,5), and previous head at (5,5).\n\nThen, if I move left to (5,5), I'm moving into my own body, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, no. In Snake, you can't move back to the previous position immediately, because your tail is there.\n\nBut in this case, after eating the apple, my body is head at (5,5), and tail at (4,5).\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), then my body becomes head at (6,5), and tail at (5,5).\n\nThen, if I move left to (5,5), I'm moving into my tail, which is now at (5,5).\n\nSo, that's still not allowed.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need to choose a different path.\n\nMaybe I should consider moving up from (5,5) to (5,6), then (5,7), then left to (4,7), then (3,7) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, rows 6 and 7 seem empty in column 5.\n\nSo, from (5,5), up to (5,6), then (5,7), then left to (4,7), then (3,7) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (7,3), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,5), down to (5,4), then (5,3), then right to"

Moving left again would bring me one step closer to the enemy snake and may lead to a collision due to limited space. Therefore, moving UP is a better choice.\n\nThe apple at (3,7) is also a less risky option after obtaining the one at (7,3) as the path towards it is clear and devoid of any enemy snakes.

Maybe I need to consider that the apple is at (5,5), and moving onto it from an adjacent cell allows me to eat it.\n\nBut since I'm already on (5,5), perhaps I need to move to another cell to eat it.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple remains until I move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nI think I need to clarify the rules of this specific Snake game.\n\nAssuming that moving onto the apple from an adjacent cell causes me to eat it, and since I'm already on (5,5), maybe I need to move to (5,5) from an adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nBut that seems odd because I'm already on (5,5).\n\nMaybe the apple disappears once I'm on it, or perhaps I need to move onto it from a different direction to eat it.\n\nTo simplify, perhaps I should consider that moving onto (5,5) from an adjacent cell allows me to eat the apple.\n\nGiven that, I need to move to (5,5) from, say, (4,5), to eat the apple.\n\nBut I'm already at (5,5), so maybe I need to move to another adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should consider the apple at (5,5) as already eaten or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are two apples: one at (0,5) and one at (5,5).\n\nLooking back, the initial information says apples are at (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0).\n\nBut the board shows an 'A' at (0,5) and (5,5), and 'T' and '2' at (5,5).\n\nMaybe there's only one apple at (0,5), and I'm at (5,5) with 'T' and '2' overlapping.\n\nThis is unclear. Perhaps I should proceed with the list of apple positions:"

It\u2019s best to stay away from the bottom left corner of the board to avoid any potential edging or cornering by the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, my plan of action remains to keep moving UP towards the apple at (7,3) ensuring that my snake stays clear of the path of the enemy snake. Post that, moving towards the left to get to (3,7) while staying as far away from the enemy snake as possible.\n\nDecided next move: UP"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at positions (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (5,6). There's an enemy snake, ID 1, at (8,2) with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout based on the given state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . T . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . A . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 0: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (5,6), which is row 5, column 6. The 'T' might represent the tail, but since I just started, maybe it's just notation. There's an apple at (0,5), which is in the same row but column 0.\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are several factors to consider:\n\n1. **Proximity**: Which apple is closest to my current position.\n\n2. **Safety**: Ensuring I don't run into walls, enemy snakes, or myself.\n\n3. **Future Path**: Planning a path that allows me to pick up multiple apples efficiently.\n\nLet's list out the distances to each apple using Manhattan distance, which is suitable for grid movements without diagonals.\n\n- To (0,5): |5-0| + |6-5| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- To (3,7): |5-3| + |6-7| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- To (7,3): |5-7| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- To (1,1): |5-1| + |6-1| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n- To (2,0): |5-2| + |6-0| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (3,7) and (7,3), both with distances of 3 and 5 respectively. The apple at (3,7) is the closest with a distance of 3.\n\nBut I should also consider the position of the enemy snake. Enemy snake 1 is at (8,2). I need to make sure that my path to the apple doesn't lead me into the enemy's path or a position where the enemy can easily cut me off.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (8,2), and I'm at (5,6). The apple at (3,7) is in the upper left direction from my current position. The enemy is in the lower right direction. So, moving towards (3,7) might take me away from the enemy, which is good.\n\nAdditionally, there are other apples at (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). I should think about a path that allows me to pick up more than one apple efficiently. But for now, let's focus on the closest apple at (3,7).\n\nTo get from (5,6) to (3,7), I need to move up twice and right once. So, possible moves:\n\n- UP to (4,6)\n\n- UP to (3,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nBut I need to make sure that these moves are safe and don't lead me into the enemy or a dead end.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (5,6), UP to (4,6):\n\n- Is (4,6) occupied? Doesn't seem so.\n\n- From (4,6), UP to (3,6):\n\n- Is (3,6) occupied? Doesn't seem so.\n\n- From (3,6), RIGHT to (3,7):\n\n- Is (3,7) occupied? It has an apple, so it's open.\n\nSo, this path seems clear. But I should also consider if the enemy might intercept me.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,2). If it moves UP, it goes to (7,2); then to (6,2); then to (5,2); and so on. It would take several moves for the enemy to reach my path.\n\nGiven that, it seems safe to proceed to (3,7).\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (3,7), I need to think about where to go next. The next closest apple would be (7,3), which is quite a distance away. I need to plan a path that avoids the enemy and doesn't lead me into a trap.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (0,5), which is also fairly distant. But considering the positions, going to (3,7) first and then to (7,3) might be a better strategy because they are somewhat aligned horizontally.\n\nWait, (3,7) and (7,3) are diagonally opposite, so maybe not the best sequence. Let's see:\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apple is likely (7,3), with a distance of |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, going to (0,5) from (3,7) would be |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nSo, (0,5) is closer from (3,7) than (7,3).\n\nBut (0,5) is also closer to the enemy's current position at (8,2). The distance for the enemy to (0,5) is |8-0| + |2-5| = 8 + 3 = 11.\n\nGiven that, and considering that I need to get to (0,5) from (3,7), which is 5 moves, and the enemy is 11 moves away from (0,5), it might still be safe.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that the enemy might change its path or grow longer, which could make it reach (0,5) faster.\n\nTo minimize risk, perhaps I should prioritize the apples that are farther from the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (0,5): 11 moves for the enemy\n\n- (3,7): |8-3| + |2-7| = 5 + 5 = 10 moves for the enemy\n\n- (7,3): |8-7| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2 moves for the enemy\n\n- (1,1): |8-1| + |2-1| = 7 + 1 = 8 moves for the enemy\n\n- (2,0): |8-2| + |2-0| = 6 + 2 = 8 moves for the enemy\n\nSo, the apple at (7,3) is only 2 moves away for the enemy. That's dangerous.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should avoid going to (7,3) for now and focus on (0,5) and (3,7), which are farther from the enemy.\n\nGiven that, going to (3,7) first, then to (0,5), might be a better strategy.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,7), I can then head to (0,5), which is 5 moves away, while the enemy would need 11 moves to get there.\n\nBut I need to consider that as I move, the enemy might also be moving towards the same apple, adjusting its path.\n\nTo be safe, perhaps I should consider picking up the apple at (0,5) first, as it's farther from the enemy and closer to my current position.\n\nWait, but (0,5) is at the top-left corner, and I'm at (5,6). The enemy is at (8,2), which is closer to (0,5) than I am.\n\nWait, no: my distance to (0,5) is |5-0| + |6-5| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves.\n\nEnemy's distance to (0,5) is |8-0| + |2-5| = 8 + 3 = 11 moves.\n\nSo, I am closer to (0,5) than the enemy is.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should aim for (0,5) directly from my current position.\n\nLet's calculate the path:\n\nFrom (5,6) to (0,5):\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,1)\n\n- Move UP to (4,1)\n\n-"

There are apples at (0,5), (5,5), (3,7), (7,3), and (1,1). Oh, and there's an enemy snake number 1 at (9,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . 2 A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . A . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (4,5), which is in row 5, column 4.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (0,5): row 5, column 0\n\n- (5,5): row 5, column 5\n\n- (3,7): row 7, column 3\n\n- (7,3): row 3, column 7\n\n- (1,1): row 1, column 1\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (9,1), which is row 1, column 9.\n\nOkay, I need to think about which apple to go for. I should consider which one is closest and which one poses the least risk.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\nTo (0,5):\n\nDistance = |4-0| + |5-5| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nTo (5,5):\n\nDistance = |4-5| + |5-5| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nTo (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |5-7| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nTo (7,3):\n\nDistance = |4-7| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nTo (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5), only 1 step away.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if there are any obstacles or enemies in that direction.\n\nLooking at the board, (5,5) is right next to me, to my right.\n\nIs there any part of my snake or the enemy snake there? From the board, it's just an apple, so it should be safe to move there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. But since I'm currently just the head at (4,5), my new position would be (5,5), and my tail would be at (4,5).\n\nNow, what's next? There are still apples at (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), and (1,1).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to eat as many apples as possible without running into walls, enemies, or myself.\n\nLet's think about the positions:\n\nFrom (5,5), I can see the apple at (0,5) is directly to my left, 5 steps away.\n\nThe apple at (3,7) is up and to the left.\n\n(7,3) is down and to the right.\n\n(1,1) is down and to the left.\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake at (9,1). I should keep an eye on its movement, but since it's only the head with no body parts, it might be less threatening for now.\n\nBut in this turn, I need to decide where to go.\n\nOption 1: Go right to (5,5), eat the apple, then plan to go left towards (0,5).\n\nOption 2: Go up towards (3,7).\n\nOption 3: Go down towards (7,3) or (1,1).\n\nHmm.\n\nGoing right to (5,5) seems straightforward, as it's only one step away.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can consider moving left towards (0,5).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), moving left to (4,5) is my tail, which is now at (4,5) after I eat the apple at (5,5).\n\nWait, no. After eating the apple at (5,5), my head moves to (5,5), and my tail remains at (4,5). So, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) would be moving into my own tail, which would cause me to die.\n\nOh no, that's a problem.\n\nSo, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (5,5), because my tail is there.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail extends, so your tail remains where it was, and you grow by one segment.\n\nSo, in this case, after eating the apple at (5,5), my body would be:\n\nHead at (5,5), previous head at (4,5).\n\nSo, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) would be moving into my own body, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (5,5).\n\nSo, maybe I should consider another direction.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,5), I can move up or down.\n\nLet's see:\n\nMoving up from (5,5) to (5,6). Is there anything there? From the board, it's empty.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can continue up to (5,7), where there's an apple at (3,7), but that's not directly up.\n\nWait, (3,7) is at column 3, row 7.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving up to (5,6), then (5,7), but that's column 5, row 7.\n\nThe apple is at column 3, row 7.\n\nSo, I would need to move left from (5,7) to (4,7), then to (3,7) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (0,5), but as we saw, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) is into my own body.\n\nSo, maybe I should move right from (5,5) to (6,5).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), move right to (6,5), which is empty.\n\nThen, I can continue moving left back to (5,5), then (4,5), but wait, my tail would be moving, so I need to be careful.\n\nActually, in Snake games, each move advances the head and the tail moves to where the previous head was.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (5,5), my body is now two segments: head at (5,5), and tail at (4,5).\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), my new body would be head at (6,5), and previous head at (5,5).\n\nThen, if I move left to (5,5), I'm moving into my own body, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, no. In Snake, you can't move back to the previous position immediately, because your tail is there.\n\nBut in this case, after eating the apple, my body is head at (5,5), and tail at (4,5).\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), then my body becomes head at (6,5), and tail at (5,5).\n\nThen, if I move left to (5,5), I'm moving into my tail, which is now at (5,5).\n\nSo, that's still not allowed.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need to choose a different path.\n\nMaybe I should consider moving up from (5,5) to (5,6), then (5,7), then left to (4,7), then (3,7) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, rows 6 and 7 seem empty in column 5.\n\nSo, from (5,5), up to (5,6), then (5,7), then left to (4,7), then (3,7) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (7,3), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,5), down to (5,4), then (5,3), then right to"

T 2 . . . .\n\nSo, 'A' at column 0, 'T' and '2' at column 5. Probably 'T' is the tail, and '2' is my head.\n\nSo, there is an apple at (0,5) and another at (5,5), where I am now. Wait, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple there, do I automatically eat it by staying put? Probably not; I need to move to a new cell to eat the apple.\n\nHmm, maybe the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto that cell to eat it.\n\nBut if I'm already there, perhaps I need to move onto it in my next move.\n\nWait, in Snake games, you move to an adjacent cell to eat the apple.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple at (5,5), maybe I need to move onto it, which would extend my snake.\n\nBut in reality, in Snake games, the apple is on the cell you move into, and eating it makes your snake longer.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple at (5,5), moving onto (5,5) would make me eat the apple and grow.\n\nBut, if I'm already on (5,5), maybe I need to move to an adjacent cell to eat the apple.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nBut in this setup, I'm at (5,5), and the apple is also at (5,5). Maybe the board notation is confusing.\n\nLet's assume that moving onto (5,5) from my current position would make me eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple is at (0,5) and (5,5), and I'm at (5,5).\n\nIn that case, moving onto (5,5) would make me eat the apple.\n\nBut, in Snake games, you can't stay in the same place; you must move to an adjacent cell.\n\nSo, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet's look back at the board:\n\nRow 5: A . . . T 2 . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, 'A' at (0,5), 'T' at (4,5), '2' at (5,5).\n\nSo, apple at (0,5), my tail at (4,5), and head at (5,5).\n\nWait, but according to the initial information, my snake is at (5,5), and the apple is also at (5,5). There might be a mismatch in notation.\n\nTo clarify:\n\n- My snake is at (5,5).\n\n- There is an apple at (5,5).\n\n- My tail is at (4,5).\n\nSo, if I move to (5,5), I should eat the apple and grow.\n\nBut in Snake games, moving onto the apple extends the snake by one segment.\n\nTherefore, if I move onto the apple at (5,5), my snake grows, and my tail remains where it was.\n\nWait, no. When you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail stays in place, and your head moves to the new cell.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and I move to (5,5), that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nBut I'm already on (5,5). Maybe the apple is still there, and moving onto it counts as eating it.\n\nIn that case, moving to (5,5) from (5,5) doesn't make sense because I can't stay in place.\n\nSo, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nBut I'm already on (5,5), so maybe I need to move to another adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the apple is at (5,5), and moving onto it from an adjacent cell allows me to eat it.\n\nBut since I'm already on (5,5), perhaps I need to move to another cell to eat it.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple remains until I move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nI think I need to clarify the rules of this specific Snake game.\n\nAssuming that moving onto the apple from an adjacent cell causes me to eat it, and since I'm already on (5,5), maybe I need to move to (5,5) from an adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nBut that seems odd because I'm already on (5,5).\n\nMaybe the apple disappears once I'm on it, or perhaps I need to move onto it from a different direction to eat it.\n\nTo simplify, perhaps I should consider that moving onto (5,5) from an adjacent cell allows me to eat the apple.\n\nGiven that, I need to move to (5,5) from, say, (4,5), to eat the apple.\n\nBut I'm already at (5,5), so maybe I need to move to another adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should consider the apple at (5,5) as already eaten or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are two apples: one at (0,5) and one at (5,5).\n\nLooking back, the initial information says apples are at (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0).\n\nBut the board shows an 'A' at (0,5) and (5,5), and 'T' and '2' at (5,5).\n\nMaybe there's only one apple at (0,5), and I'm at (5,5) with 'T' and '2' overlapping.\n\nThis is unclear. Perhaps I should proceed with the list of apple positions:"

The apples at (0,5), (1,1), and (2,0) are closer to the enemy snake and it's likely that it will get those first. So my strategy should not depend on obtaining those. It\u2019s best to stay away from the bottom left corner of the board to avoid any potential edging or cornering by the enemy snake.\n\nTherefore, my plan of action remains to keep moving UP towards the apple at (7,3) ensuring that my snake stays clear of the path of the enemy snake. Post that, moving towards the left to get to (3,7) while staying as far away from the enemy snake as possible.\n\nDecided next move: UP"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at positions (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (5,6). There's an enemy snake, ID 1, at (8,2) with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout based on the given state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . T . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . A . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 0: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (5,6), which is row 5, column 6. The 'T' might represent the tail, but since I just started, maybe it's just notation. There's an apple at (0,5), which is in the same row but column 0.\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are several factors to consider:\n\n1. **Proximity**: Which apple is closest to my current position.\n\n2. **Safety**: Ensuring I don't run into walls, enemy snakes, or myself.\n\n3. **Future Path**: Planning a path that allows me to pick up multiple apples efficiently.\n\nLet's list out the distances to each apple using Manhattan distance, which is suitable for grid movements without diagonals.\n\n- To (0,5): |5-0| + |6-5| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- To (3,7): |5-3| + |6-7| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- To (7,3): |5-7| + |6-3| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- To (1,1): |5-1| + |6-1| = 4 + 5 = 9\n\n- To (2,0): |5-2| + |6-0| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (3,7) and (7,3), both with distances of 3 and 5 respectively. The apple at (3,7) is the closest with a distance of 3.\n\nBut I should also consider the position of the enemy snake. Enemy snake 1 is at (8,2). I need to make sure that my path to the apple doesn't lead me into the enemy's path or a position where the enemy can easily cut me off.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (8,2), and I'm at (5,6). The apple at (3,7) is in the upper left direction from my current position. The enemy is in the lower right direction. So, moving towards (3,7) might take me away from the enemy, which is good.\n\nAdditionally, there are other apples at (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). I should think about a path that allows me to pick up more than one apple efficiently. But for now, let's focus on the closest apple at (3,7).\n\nTo get from (5,6) to (3,7), I need to move up twice and right once. So, possible moves:\n\n- UP to (4,6)\n\n- UP to (3,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nBut I need to make sure that these moves are safe and don't lead me into the enemy or a dead end.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (5,6), UP to (4,6):\n\n- Is (4,6) occupied? Doesn't seem so.\n\n- From (4,6), UP to (3,6):\n\n- Is (3,6) occupied? Doesn't seem so.\n\n- From (3,6), RIGHT to (3,7):\n\n- Is (3,7) occupied? It has an apple, so it's open.\n\nSo, this path seems clear. But I should also consider if the enemy might intercept me.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,2). If it moves UP, it goes to (7,2); then to (6,2); then to (5,2); and so on. It would take several moves for the enemy to reach my path.\n\nGiven that, it seems safe to proceed to (3,7).\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (3,7), I need to think about where to go next. The next closest apple would be (7,3), which is quite a distance away. I need to plan a path that avoids the enemy and doesn't lead me into a trap.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (0,5), which is also fairly distant. But considering the positions, going to (3,7) first and then to (7,3) might be a better strategy because they are somewhat aligned horizontally.\n\nWait, (3,7) and (7,3) are diagonally opposite, so maybe not the best sequence. Let's see:\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apple is likely (7,3), with a distance of |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, going to (0,5) from (3,7) would be |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nSo, (0,5) is closer from (3,7) than (7,3).\n\nBut (0,5) is also closer to the enemy's current position at (8,2). The distance for the enemy to (0,5) is |8-0| + |2-5| = 8 + 3 = 11.\n\nGiven that, and considering that I need to get to (0,5) from (3,7), which is 5 moves, and the enemy is 11 moves away from (0,5), it might still be safe.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that the enemy might change its path or grow longer, which could make it reach (0,5) faster.\n\nTo minimize risk, perhaps I should prioritize the apples that are farther from the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (0,5): 11 moves for the enemy\n\n- (3,7): |8-3| + |2-7| = 5 + 5 = 10 moves for the enemy\n\n- (7,3): |8-7| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2 moves for the enemy\n\n- (1,1): |8-1| + |2-1| = 7 + 1 = 8 moves for the enemy\n\n- (2,0): |8-2| + |2-0| = 6 + 2 = 8 moves for the enemy\n\nSo, the apple at (7,3) is only 2 moves away for the enemy. That's dangerous.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should avoid going to (7,3) for now and focus on (0,5) and (3,7), which are farther from the enemy.\n\nGiven that, going to (3,7) first, then to (0,5), might be a better strategy.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,7), I can then head to (0,5), which is 5 moves away, while the enemy would need 11 moves to get there.\n\nBut I need to consider that as I move, the enemy might also be moving towards the same apple, adjusting its path.\n\nTo be safe, perhaps I should consider picking up the apple at (0,5) first, as it's farther from the enemy and closer to my current position.\n\nWait, but (0,5) is at the top-left corner, and I'm at (5,6). The enemy is at (8,2), which is closer to (0,5) than I am.\n\nWait, no: my distance to (0,5) is |5-0| + |6-5| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves.\n\nEnemy's distance to (0,5) is |8-0| + |2-5| = 8 + 3 = 11 moves.\n\nSo, I am closer to (0,5) than the enemy is.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should aim for (0,5) directly from my current position.\n\nLet's calculate the path:\n\nFrom (5,6) to (0,5):\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,1)\n\n- Move UP to (4,1)\n\n-"

There are apples at positions (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (5,7).\n\nWait, in the board state, it shows my position at (5,7), but in the text, it says (5,6). Let me clarify that. Looking back, it says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,7)\", but in the board state, it shows '2' at row 5, column 6, which would be (5,6). There might be confusion here.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 7: . . . A . 2 . . . .\n\nSo, '2' is at column 6, row 7, which would be (7,6). Wait, that doesn't match. Let's double-check.\n\nWait, the board is labeled with row numbers decreasing from top to bottom:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . . A . 2 . . . .\n\n6 . . . . .

There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps the coordinates are given as (row, column), not (x, y). In grid systems, sometimes it's (row, column). Let me check.\n\nIf (0,0) is bottom left, then increasing row numbers go up, and column numbers go right.\n\nSo, position (row, column):\n\n- (0,0) is bottom left\n\n- (9,9) is top right\n\nIn the board, '2' is at row 7, column 6, which would be (7,6).\n\nBut earlier, it was stated that the snake is at (5,7). This seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial information. I'll proceed with the board state, assuming '2' is at (7,6).\n\nSo, my position is (7,6).\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (3,7)\n\n- (7,3)\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (2,0)\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,3) with no body parts.\n\nOkay, with that clarified, I need to decide my next move.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,6) to each apple:\n\n- To (0,5): |7-0| + |6-5| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n- To (3,7): |7-3| + |6-7| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- To (7,3): |7-7| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n- To (1,1): |7-1| + |6-1| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- To (2,0): |7-2| + |6-0| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3), with a distance of 3.\n\nNext closest is (3,7) at distance 5, and (0,5) at distance 8.\n\nNow, I need to consider the position of the enemy snake. The enemy is at (8,3), which is close to me.\n\nI need to plan a path to the apple at (7,3) and ensure that I don't run into the enemy.\n\nLet's visualize the path:\n\nFrom (7,6) to (7,3):\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,3)\n\nI need to check if the enemy can intercept me on this path.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,3). If it moves UP to (7,3), it would directly conflict with my path.\n\nSo, that's a potential danger.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for the apple at (3,7), which is at a distance of 5.\n\nPath from (7,6) to (3,7):\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (5,6)\n\n- Move UP to (4,6)\n\n- Move UP to (3,6)\n\n- Move RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nThis path seems longer, but it takes me away from the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,3), and if it moves towards (3,7), it would need to move UP to (7,3), then LEFT to (7,2), and so on, which would take more moves.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (3,7) is safer.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,7), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nLet's think about the next apple to go for after (3,7).\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apples would be:\n\n- (7,3): |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (0,5): |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, (0,5) is closer.\n\nBut (0,5) is also relatively far from my current position, and the enemy is closer to (0,5) than I am.\n\nWait, no, earlier I saw that I am closer to (0,5) than the enemy.\n\nWait, let's recalculate distances:\n\nMy position: (7,6)\n\nApple at (0,5): |7-0| + |6-5| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nEnemy at (8,3) to (0,5): |8-0| + |3-5| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\nSo, the enemy is farther from (0,5) than I am.\n\nTherefore, perhaps going for (0,5) directly from my current position is safer, as the enemy has to cover more distance.\n\nLet's plan a path to (0,5):\n\nFrom (7,6) to (0,5):\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (5,6)\n\n- Move UP to (4,6)\n\n- Move UP to (3,6)\n\n- Move UP to (2,6)\n\n- Move UP to (1,6)\n\n- Move UP to (0,6)\n\n- Move LEFT to (0,5)\n\nThat's 7 moves up and 1 left, totaling 8 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy would need to move to (0,5), which is 10 moves away.\n\nSo, I can reach (0,5) before the enemy does.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that the enemy doesn't change its path to intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider picking up the apple at (3,7) first, then go to (0,5).\n\nBut that would take me 5 moves to (3,7) and then 5 more moves to (0,5), totaling 10 moves, while directly going to (0,5) is 8 moves.\n\nSo, going directly to (0,5) is more efficient.\n\nAlso, after eating (0,5), I can consider going for another apple.\n\nFrom (0,5), the closest apples would be:\n\n- (1,1): |0-1| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- (2,0): |0-2| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nSo, (1,1) is closest.\n\nBut (1,1) is also close to the enemy's starting position.\n\nWait, enemy is at (8,3). Distance to (1,1):\n\n|8-1| + |3-1| = 7 + 2 = 9 moves.\n\nSo, from (0,5), I can go to (1,1) in 5 moves, while the enemy would need 9 moves to get there.\n\nThat seems safe.\n\nAfter that, the remaining apples are (3,7) and (7,3).\n\nFrom (1,1), to (3,7):\n\n|1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\nTo (7,3): |1-7| + |1-3| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, both are equidistant.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (3,7) next.\n\nBut considering the enemy's position"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (4,5). There are apples at (0,5), (5,5), (3,7), (7,3), and (1,1). Oh, and there's an enemy snake number 1 at (9,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . 2 A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . A . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (4,5), which is in row 5, column 4.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (0,5): row 5, column 0\n\n- (5,5): row 5, column 5\n\n- (3,7): row 7, column 3\n\n- (7,3): row 3, column 7\n\n- (1,1): row 1, column 1\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (9,1), which is row 1, column 9.\n\nOkay, I need to think about which apple to go for. I should consider which one is closest and which one poses the least risk.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\nTo (0,5):\n\nDistance = |4-0| + |5-5| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nTo (5,5):\n\nDistance = |4-5| + |5-5| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nTo (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |5-7| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nTo (7,3):\n\nDistance = |4-7| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nTo (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5), only 1 step away.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if there are any obstacles or enemies in that direction.\n\nLooking at the board, (5,5) is right next to me, to my right.\n\nIs there any part of my snake or the enemy snake there? From the board, it's just an apple, so it should be safe to move there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. But since I'm currently just the head at (4,5), my new position would be (5,5), and my tail would be at (4,5).\n\nNow, what's next? There are still apples at (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), and (1,1).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to eat as many apples as possible without running into walls, enemies, or myself.\n\nLet's think about the positions:\n\nFrom (5,5), I can see the apple at (0,5) is directly to my left, 5 steps away.\n\nThe apple at (3,7) is up and to the left.\n\n(7,3) is down and to the right.\n\n(1,1) is down and to the left.\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake at (9,1). I should keep an eye on its movement, but since it's only the head with no body parts, it might be less threatening for now.\n\nBut in this turn, I need to decide where to go.\n\nOption 1: Go right to (5,5), eat the apple, then plan to go left towards (0,5).\n\nOption 2: Go up towards (3,7).\n\nOption 3: Go down towards (7,3) or (1,1).\n\nHmm.\n\nGoing right to (5,5) seems straightforward, as it's only one step away.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can consider moving left towards (0,5).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), moving left to (4,5) is my tail, which is now at (4,5) after I eat the apple at (5,5).\n\nWait, no. After eating the apple at (5,5), my head moves to (5,5), and my tail remains at (4,5). So, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) would be moving into my own tail, which would cause me to die.\n\nOh no, that's a problem.\n\nSo, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (5,5), because my tail is there.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail extends, so your tail remains where it was, and you grow by one segment.\n\nSo, in this case, after eating the apple at (5,5), my body would be:\n\nHead at (5,5), previous head at (4,5).\n\nSo, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) would be moving into my own body, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (5,5).\n\nSo, maybe I should consider another direction.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,5), I can move up or down.\n\nLet's see:\n\nMoving up from (5,5) to (5,6). Is there anything there? From the board, it's empty.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can continue up to (5,7), where there's an apple at (3,7), but that's not directly up.\n\nWait, (3,7) is at column 3, row 7.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving up to (5,6), then (5,7), but that's column 5, row 7.\n\nThe apple is at column 3, row 7.\n\nSo, I would need to move left from (5,7) to (4,7), then to (3,7) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (0,5), but as we saw, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) is into my own body.\n\nSo, maybe I should move right from (5,5) to (6,5).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), move right to (6,5), which is empty.\n\nThen, I can continue moving left back to (5,5), then (4,5), but wait, my tail would be moving, so I need to be careful.\n\nActually, in Snake games, each move advances the head and the tail moves to where the previous head was.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (5,5), my body is now two segments: head at (5,5), and tail at (4,5).\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), my new body would be head at (6,5), and previous head at (5,5).\n\nThen, if I move left to (5,5), I'm moving into my own body, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, no. In Snake, you can't move back to the previous position immediately, because your tail is there.\n\nBut in this case, after eating the apple, my body is head at (5,5), and tail at (4,5).\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), then my body becomes head at (6,5), and tail at (5,5).\n\nThen, if I move left to (5,5), I'm moving into my tail, which is now at (5,5).\n\nSo, that's still not allowed.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need to choose a different path.\n\nMaybe I should consider moving up from (5,5) to (5,6), then (5,7), then left to (4,7), then (3,7) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, rows 6 and 7 seem empty in column 5.\n\nSo, from (5,5), up to (5,6), then (5,7), then left to (4,7), then (3,7) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (7,3), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,5), down to (5,4), then (5,3), then right to"

Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at positions (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (5,5). There's an enemy snake, ID 1, at (8,1) with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout based on the given state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . .

The 'T' might represent the tail, but since I just started, maybe it's just notation. There's an apple at (0,5), which is in the same row but column 0.\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are several factors to consider:\n\n1. **Proximity**: Which apple is closest to my current position.\n\n2. **Safety**: Ensuring I don't run into walls, enemy snakes, or myself.\n\n3. **Future Path**: Planning a path that allows me to pick up multiple apples efficiently.\n\nLet's list out the distances to each apple using Manhattan distance, which is suitable for grid movements without diagonals.\n\n- To (0,5): |5-0| + |5-5| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n- To (3,7): |5-3| + |5-7| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (7,3): |5-7| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (1,1): |5-1| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- To (2,0): |5-2| + |5-0| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (3,7) and (7,3), both with a distance of 4.\n\nBut wait, there's also an apple at (0,5) which is distance 5, and another at (5,5), which seems to be where I am now. Wait, the board shows an 'A' at (0,5) and (5,5), and 'T' and '2' at (5,5). Maybe there's confusion in notation.\n\nLooking back, the board shows:\n\nRow 5: A . . . T 2 . . . .\n\nSo, 'A' at column 0, 'T' and '2' at column 5. Probably 'T' is the tail, and '2' is my head.\n\nSo, there is an apple at (0,5) and another at (5,5), where I am now. Wait, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple there, do I automatically eat it by staying put? Probably not; I need to move to a new cell to eat the apple.\n\nHmm, maybe the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto that cell to eat it.\n\nBut if I'm already there, perhaps I need to move onto it in my next move.\n\nWait, in Snake games, you move to an adjacent cell to eat the apple.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple at (5,5), maybe I need to move onto it, which would extend my snake.\n\nBut in reality, in Snake games, the apple is on the cell you move into, and eating it makes your snake longer.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple at (5,5), moving onto (5,5) would make me eat the apple and grow.\n\nBut, if I'm already on (5,5), maybe I need to move to an adjacent cell to eat the apple.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nBut in this setup, I'm at (5,5), and the apple is also at (5,5). Maybe the board notation is confusing.\n\nLet's assume that moving onto (5,5) from my current position would make me eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple is at (0,5) and (5,5), and I'm at (5,5).\n\nIn that case, moving onto (5,5) would make me eat the apple.\n\nBut, in Snake games, you can't stay in the same place; you must move to an adjacent cell.\n\nSo, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet's look back at the board:\n\nRow 5: A . . . T 2 . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, 'A' at (0,5), 'T' at (4,5), '2' at (5,5).\n\nSo, apple at (0,5), my tail at (4,5), and head at (5,5).\n\nWait, but according to the initial information, my snake is at (5,5), and the apple is also at (5,5). There might be a mismatch in notation.\n\nTo clarify:\n\n- My snake is at (5,5).\n\n- There is an apple at (5,5).\n\n- My tail is at (4,5).\n\nSo, if I move to (5,5), I should eat the apple and grow.\n\nBut in Snake games, moving onto the apple extends the snake by one segment.\n\nTherefore, if I move onto the apple at (5,5), my snake grows, and my tail remains where it was.\n\nWait, no. When you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail stays in place, and your head moves to the new cell.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and I move to (5,5), that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nBut I'm already on (5,5). Maybe the apple is still there, and moving onto it counts as eating it.\n\nIn that case, moving to (5,5) from (5,5) doesn't make sense because I can't stay in place.\n\nSo, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nBut I'm already on (5,5), so maybe I need to move to another adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the apple is at (5,5), and moving onto it from an adjacent cell allows me to eat it.\n\nBut since I'm already on (5,5), perhaps I need to move to another cell to eat it.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple remains until I move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nI think I need to clarify the rules of this specific Snake game.\n\nAssuming that moving onto the apple from an adjacent cell causes me to eat it, and since I'm already on (5,5), maybe I need to move to (5,5) from an adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nBut that seems odd because I'm already on (5,5).\n\nMaybe the apple disappears once I'm on it, or perhaps I need to move onto it from a different direction to eat it.\n\nTo simplify, perhaps I should consider that moving onto (5,5) from an adjacent cell allows me to eat the apple.\n\nGiven that, I need to move to (5,5) from, say, (4,5), to eat the apple.\n\nBut I'm already at (5,5), so maybe I need to move to another adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should consider the apple at (5,5) as already eaten or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are two apples: one at (0,5) and one at (5,5).\n\nLooking back, the initial information says apples are at (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0).\n\nBut the board shows an 'A' at (0,5) and (5,5), and 'T' and '2' at (5,5).\n\nMaybe there's only one apple at (0,5), and I'm at (5,5) with 'T' and '2' overlapping.\n\nThis is unclear. Perhaps I should proceed with the list of apple positions:"

The apple at (3,7) is the closest with a distance of 3.\n\nBut I should also consider the position of the enemy snake. Enemy snake 1 is at (8,2). I need to make sure that my path to the apple doesn't lead me into the enemy's path or a position where the enemy can easily cut me off.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (8,2), and I'm at (5,6). The apple at (3,7) is in the upper left direction from my current position. The enemy is in the lower right direction. So, moving towards (3,7) might take me away from the enemy, which is good.\n\nAdditionally, there are other apples at (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). I should think about a path that allows me to pick up more than one apple efficiently. But for now, let's focus on the closest apple at (3,7).\n\nTo get from (5,6) to (3,7), I need to move up twice and right once. So, possible moves:\n\n- UP to (4,6)\n\n- UP to (3,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nBut I need to make sure that these moves are safe and don't lead me into the enemy or a dead end.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (5,6), UP to (4,6):\n\n- Is (4,6) occupied? Doesn't seem so.\n\n- From (4,6), UP to (3,6):\n\n- Is (3,6) occupied? Doesn't seem so.\n\n- From (3,6), RIGHT to (3,7):\n\n- Is (3,7) occupied? It has an apple, so it's open.\n\nSo, this path seems clear. But I should also consider if the enemy might intercept me.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,2). If it moves UP, it goes to (7,2); then to (6,2); then to (5,2); and so on. It would take several moves for the enemy to reach my path.\n\nGiven that, it seems safe to proceed to (3,7).\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (3,7), I need to think about where to go next. The next closest apple would be (7,3), which is quite a distance away. I need to plan a path that avoids the enemy and doesn't lead me into a trap.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (0,5), which is also fairly distant. But considering the positions, going to (3,7) first and then to (7,3) might be a better strategy because they are somewhat aligned horizontally.\n\nWait, (3,7) and (7,3) are diagonally opposite, so maybe not the best sequence. Let's see:\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apple is likely (7,3), with a distance of |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, going to (0,5) from (3,7) would be |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nSo, (0,5) is closer from (3,7) than (7,3).\n\nBut (0,5) is also closer to the enemy's current position at (8,2). The distance for the enemy to (0,5) is |8-0| + |2-5| = 8 + 3 = 11.\n\nGiven that, and considering that I need to get to (0,5) from (3,7), which is 5 moves, and the enemy is 11 moves away from (0,5), it might still be safe.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that the enemy might change its path or grow longer, which could make it reach (0,5) faster.\n\nTo minimize risk, perhaps I should prioritize the apples that are farther from the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (0,5): 11 moves for the enemy\n\n- (3,7): |8-3| + |2-7| = 5 + 5 = 10 moves for the enemy\n\n- (7,3): |8-7| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2 moves for the enemy\n\n- (1,1): |8-1| + |2-1| = 7 + 1 = 8 moves for the enemy\n\n- (2,0): |8-2| + |2-0| = 6 + 2 = 8 moves for the enemy\n\nSo, the apple at (7,3) is only 2 moves away for the enemy. That's dangerous.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should avoid going to (7,3) for now and focus on (0,5) and (3,7), which are farther from the enemy.\n\nGiven that, going to (3,7) first, then to (0,5), might be a better strategy.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,7), I can then head to (0,5), which is 5 moves away, while the enemy would need 11 moves to get there.\n\nBut I need to consider that as I move, the enemy might also be moving towards the same apple, adjusting its path.\n\nTo be safe, perhaps I should consider picking up the apple at (0,5) first, as it's farther from the enemy and closer to my current position.\n\nWait, but (0,5) is at the top-left corner, and I'm at (5,6). The enemy is at (8,2), which is closer to (0,5) than I am.\n\nWait, no: my distance to (0,5) is |5-0| + |6-5| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves.\n\nEnemy's distance to (0,5) is |8-0| + |2-5| = 8 + 3 = 11 moves.\n\nSo, I am closer to (0,5) than the enemy is.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should aim for (0,5) directly from my current position.\n\nLet's calculate the path:\n\nFrom (5,6) to (0,5):\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,1)\n\n- Move UP to (4,1)\n\n-"

Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at positions (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (5,7).\n\nWait, in the board state, it shows my position at (5,7), but in the text, it says (5,6). Let me clarify that. Looking back, it says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,7)\", but in the board state, it shows '2' at row 5, column 6, which would be (5,6). There might be confusion here.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 7: . . . A . 2 . . . .\n\nSo, '2' is at column 6, row 7, which would be (7,6). Wait, that doesn't match. Let's double-check.\n\nWait, the board is labeled with row numbers decreasing from top to bottom:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . . A . 2 . . . .\n\n6 . . . . .

A . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, '2' is at row 7, column 6, which is (7,6). But earlier it was mentioned (5,7). There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps the coordinates are given as (row, column), not (x, y). In grid systems, sometimes it's (row, column). Let me check.\n\nIf (0,0) is bottom left, then increasing row numbers go up, and column numbers go right.\n\nSo, position (row, column):\n\n- (0,0) is bottom left\n\n- (9,9) is top right\n\nIn the board, '2' is at row 7, column 6, which would be (7,6).\n\nBut earlier, it was stated that the snake is at (5,7). This seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial information. I'll proceed with the board state, assuming '2' is at (7,6).\n\nSo, my position is (7,6).\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (3,7)\n\n- (7,3)\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (2,0)\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,3) with no body parts.\n\nOkay, with that clarified, I need to decide my next move.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,6) to each apple:\n\n- To (0,5): |7-0| + |6-5| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n- To (3,7): |7-3| + |6-7| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- To (7,3): |7-7| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n- To (1,1): |7-1| + |6-1| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- To (2,0): |7-2| + |6-0| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3), with a distance of 3.\n\nNext closest is (3,7) at distance 5, and (0,5) at distance 8.\n\nNow, I need to consider the position of the enemy snake. The enemy is at (8,3), which is close to me.\n\nI need to plan a path to the apple at (7,3) and ensure that I don't run into the enemy.\n\nLet's visualize the path:\n\nFrom (7,6) to (7,3):\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,3)\n\nI need to check if the enemy can intercept me on this path.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,3). If it moves UP to (7,3), it would directly conflict with my path.\n\nSo, that's a potential danger.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for the apple at (3,7), which is at a distance of 5.\n\nPath from (7,6) to (3,7):\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (5,6)\n\n- Move UP to (4,6)\n\n- Move UP to (3,6)\n\n- Move RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nThis path seems longer, but it takes me away from the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,3), and if it moves towards (3,7), it would need to move UP to (7,3), then LEFT to (7,2), and so on, which would take more moves.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (3,7) is safer.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,7), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nLet's think about the next apple to go for after (3,7).\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apples would be:\n\n- (7,3): |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (0,5): |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, (0,5) is closer.\n\nBut (0,5) is also relatively far from my current position, and the enemy is closer to (0,5) than I am.\n\nWait, no, earlier I saw that I am closer to (0,5) than the enemy.\n\nWait, let's recalculate distances:\n\nMy position: (7,6)\n\nApple at (0,5): |7-0| + |6-5| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nEnemy at (8,3) to (0,5): |8-0| + |3-5| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\nSo, the enemy is farther from (0,5) than I am.\n\nTherefore, perhaps going for (0,5) directly from my current position is safer, as the enemy has to cover more distance.\n\nLet's plan a path to (0,5):\n\nFrom (7,6) to (0,5):\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (5,6)\n\n- Move UP to (4,6)\n\n- Move UP to (3,6)\n\n- Move UP to (2,6)\n\n- Move UP to (1,6)\n\n- Move UP to (0,6)\n\n- Move LEFT to (0,5)\n\nThat's 7 moves up and 1 left, totaling 8 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy would need to move to (0,5), which is 10 moves away.\n\nSo, I can reach (0,5) before the enemy does.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that the enemy doesn't change its path to intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider picking up the apple at (3,7) first, then go to (0,5).\n\nBut that would take me 5 moves to (3,7) and then 5 more moves to (0,5), totaling 10 moves, while directly going to (0,5) is 8 moves.\n\nSo, going directly to (0,5) is more efficient.\n\nAlso, after eating (0,5), I can consider going for another apple.\n\nFrom (0,5), the closest apples would be:\n\n- (1,1): |0-1| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- (2,0): |0-2| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nSo, (1,1) is closest.\n\nBut (1,1) is also close to the enemy's starting position.\n\nWait, enemy is at (8,3). Distance to (1,1):\n\n|8-1| + |3-1| = 7 + 2 = 9 moves.\n\nSo, from (0,5), I can go to (1,1) in 5 moves, while the enemy would need 9 moves to get there.\n\nThat seems safe.\n\nAfter that, the remaining apples are (3,7) and (7,3).\n\nFrom (1,1), to (3,7):\n\n|1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\nTo (7,3): |1-7| + |1-3| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, both are equidistant.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (3,7) next.\n\nBut considering the enemy's position"

I'll go with the board state, so my position is (7,6).\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,2) with no body parts.\n\nOkay, so I need to decide my next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,6) to each apple:\n\n- To (0,5): |7-0| + |6-5| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n- To (3,7): |7-3| + |6-7| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- To (7,3): |7-7| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n- To (1,1): |7-1| + |6-1| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- To (2,0): |7-2| + |6-0| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3), distance 3. Next is (3,7) at distance 5, and (0,5) at distance 8. The others are farther.\n\nNow, I need to consider the enemy snake's position at (8,2). That's somewhat close to the apple at (7,3), as the enemy would need to move to (7,2) and then to (7,3), which is a distance of 1 + 1 = 2 moves.\n\nWait, but I need to think about the timing. If I move towards (7,3), and the enemy moves towards (7,3) as well, they might get there before me.\n\nWait, no. I'm closer to (7,3) than the enemy is. I'm at (7,6), so it's 3 moves away, and the enemy is at (8,2), which is 2 moves away to (7,2) and then one more to (7,3), totaling 3 moves as well.\n\nSo, we might reach (7,3) at the same time if we both go for it.\n\nBut I need to consider that if both snakes reach the apple at the same time, probably only one will get it, and perhaps the one that reaches first, or maybe it's undefined. To play it safe, I should consider that the enemy might get to (7,3) before me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can plan a path that allows me to get to (7,3) before the enemy.\n\nLet's think about possible paths.\n\nFrom (7,6) to (7,3):\n\n- LEFT to (7,5)\n\n- LEFT to (7,4)\n\n- LEFT to (7,3)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nEnemy from (8,2) to (7,3):\n\n- UP to (7,2)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,3)\n\nThat's 2 moves.\n\nWait, that's faster than my 3 moves. So, the enemy can get to (7,3) in 2 moves, while I need 3. That means the enemy will reach first unless I can interfere or find a different path.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider going for (3,7) instead, which is at a distance of 5.\n\nFrom (7,6) to (3,7):\n\n- UP to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (5,6)\n\n- UP to (4,6)\n\n- UP to (3,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nEnemy from (8,2) to (3,7):\n\n- UP to (7,2)\n\n- UP to (6,2)\n\n- UP to (5,2)\n\n- UP to (4,2)\n\n- UP to (3,2)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nThat's 2 moves up and then 5 moves right, totaling 7 moves.\n\nSo, in this case, I can reach (3,7) in 5 moves, and the enemy would take 7 moves, so I reach first.\n\nAfter eating (3,7), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apples are:\n\n- (0,5): |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (7,3): |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (1,1): |3-1| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- (2,0): |3-2| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nSo, (0,5) is the closest at 5 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy, after moving 7 moves to (3,7), would have to go to another apple.\n\nBut since I'm already at (3,7), and assuming I eat it, I can move to (0,5) before the enemy can get there.\n\nFrom (3,7) to (0,5):\n\n- LEFT to (3,6)\n\n- LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,2)\n\n- LEFT to (3,1)\n\n- LEFT to (3,0)\n\n- DOWN to (4,0)\n\n- DOWN to (5,0)\n\n- DOWN to (6,0)\n\n- DOWN to (7,0)\n\n- DOWN to (8,0)\n\n- DOWN to (9,0)\n\nWait, that seems inefficient. Let's recalculate.\n\nFrom (3,7) to (0,5):\n\n- UP to (2,7)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n- UP to (0,7)\n\n- LEFT to (0,6)\n\n- LEFT to (0,5)\n\nThat's 3 UP and 2 LEFT, totaling 5 moves.\n\nDuring this time, the enemy would have to move from (3,7) to (0,5). But wait, the enemy is at (3,7) after 7 moves, and I'm already there after 5 moves.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me outline a sequence:\n\n1. Move to (3,7) via UP,UP,UP,UP,RIGHT.\n\n2. Eat the apple at (3,7).\n\n3. Move to (0,5) via UP,UP,UP,LEFT,LEFT.\n\nTotal moves: 5 + 5 = 10 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy starts at (8,2):\n\n- Moves to (7,2)\n\n- Moves to (6,2)\n\n- Moves to (5,2)\n\n- Moves to (4,2)\n\n- Moves to (3,2)\n\n- Moves to (3,3)\n\n- Moves to (3,4)\n\n- Moves to (3,5)\n\n- Moves to (3,6)\n\n- Moves to (3,7)\n\nThat's 7 moves to reach (3,7), but I've already eaten it by then.\n\nThen, the enemy would have to go for another apple.\n\nSo, perhaps this is a viable strategy.\n\nAfter eating (0,5), the closest apples are (1,1) and (2,0), both at a distance of 5 moves.\n\nFrom (0,5) to (1,1):\n\n- DOWN to (1,5)\n\n- DOWN to (2,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- DOWN to (5,5)\n\n- DOWN to (6,5)\n\n- DOWN to (7,5)\n\n- DOWN to (8,5)\n\n- RIGHT to"

I should consider which one is closest and which one poses the least risk.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\nTo (0,5):\n\nDistance = |4-0| + |5-5| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nTo (5,5):\n\nDistance = |4-5| + |5-5| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nTo (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |5-7| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nTo (7,3):\n\nDistance = |4-7| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nTo (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5), only 1 step away.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if there are any obstacles or enemies in that direction.\n\nLooking at the board, (5,5) is right next to me, to my right.\n\nIs there any part of my snake or the enemy snake there? From the board, it's just an apple, so it should be safe to move there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. But since I'm currently just the head at (4,5), my new position would be (5,5), and my tail would be at (4,5).\n\nNow, what's next? There are still apples at (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), and (1,1).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to eat as many apples as possible without running into walls, enemies, or myself.\n\nLet's think about the positions:\n\nFrom (5,5), I can see the apple at (0,5) is directly to my left, 5 steps away.\n\nThe apple at (3,7) is up and to the left.\n\n(7,3) is down and to the right.\n\n(1,1) is down and to the left.\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake at (9,1). I should keep an eye on its movement, but since it's only the head with no body parts, it might be less threatening for now.\n\nBut in this turn, I need to decide where to go.\n\nOption 1: Go right to (5,5), eat the apple, then plan to go left towards (0,5).\n\nOption 2: Go up towards (3,7).\n\nOption 3: Go down towards (7,3) or (1,1).\n\nHmm.\n\nGoing right to (5,5) seems straightforward, as it's only one step away.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can consider moving left towards (0,5).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), moving left to (4,5) is my tail, which is now at (4,5) after I eat the apple at (5,5).\n\nWait, no. After eating the apple at (5,5), my head moves to (5,5), and my tail remains at (4,5). So, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) would be moving into my own tail, which would cause me to die.\n\nOh no, that's a problem.\n\nSo, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (5,5), because my tail is there.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail extends, so your tail remains where it was, and you grow by one segment.\n\nSo, in this case, after eating the apple at (5,5), my body would be:\n\nHead at (5,5), previous head at (4,5).\n\nSo, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) would be moving into my own body, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (5,5).\n\nSo, maybe I should consider another direction.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,5), I can move up or down.\n\nLet's see:\n\nMoving up from (5,5) to (5,6). Is there anything there? From the board, it's empty.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can continue up to (5,7), where there's an apple at (3,7), but that's not directly up.\n\nWait, (3,7) is at column 3, row 7.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving up to (5,6), then (5,7), but that's column 5, row 7.\n\nThe apple is at column 3, row 7.\n\nSo, I would need to move left from (5,7) to (4,7), then to (3,7) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (0,5), but as we saw, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) is into my own body.\n\nSo, maybe I should move right from (5,5) to (6,5).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), move right to (6,5), which is empty.\n\nThen, I can continue moving left back to (5,5), then (4,5), but wait, my tail would be moving, so I need to be careful.\n\nActually, in Snake games, each move advances the head and the tail moves to where the previous head was.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (5,5), my body is now two segments: head at (5,5), and tail at (4,5).\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), my new body would be head at (6,5), and previous head at (5,5).\n\nThen, if I move left to (5,5), I'm moving into my own body, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, no. In Snake, you can't move back to the previous position immediately, because your tail is there.\n\nBut in this case, after eating the apple, my body is head at (5,5), and tail at (4,5).\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), then my body becomes head at (6,5), and tail at (5,5).\n\nThen, if I move left to (5,5), I'm moving into my tail, which is now at (5,5).\n\nSo, that's still not allowed.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need to choose a different path.\n\nMaybe I should consider moving up from (5,5) to (5,6), then (5,7), then left to (4,7), then (3,7) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, rows 6 and 7 seem empty in column 5.\n\nSo, from (5,5), up to (5,6), then (5,7), then left to (4,7), then (3,7) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (7,3), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,5), down to (5,4), then (5,3), then right to"

Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at positions (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (5,5). There's an enemy snake, ID 1, at (8,1) with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout based on the given state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . .

The 'T' might represent the tail, but since I just started, maybe it's just notation. There's an apple at (0,5), which is in the same row but column 0.\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are several factors to consider:\n\n1. **Proximity**: Which apple is closest to my current position.\n\n2. **Safety**: Ensuring I don't run into walls, enemy snakes, or myself.\n\n3. **Future Path**: Planning a path that allows me to pick up multiple apples efficiently.\n\nLet's list out the distances to each apple using Manhattan distance, which is suitable for grid movements without diagonals.\n\n- To (0,5): |5-0| + |5-5| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n- To (3,7): |5-3| + |5-7| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (7,3): |5-7| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (1,1): |5-1| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- To (2,0): |5-2| + |5-0| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (3,7) and (7,3), both with a distance of 4.\n\nBut wait, there's also an apple at (0,5) which is distance 5, and another at (5,5), which seems to be where I am now. Wait, the board shows an 'A' at (0,5) and (5,5), and 'T' and '2' at (5,5). Maybe there's confusion in notation.\n\nLooking back, the board shows:\n\nRow 5: A . . . T 2 . . . .\n\nSo, 'A' at column 0, 'T' and '2' at column 5. Probably 'T' is the tail, and '2' is my head.\n\nSo, there is an apple at (0,5) and another at (5,5), where I am now. Wait, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple there, do I automatically eat it by staying put? Probably not; I need to move to a new cell to eat the apple.\n\nHmm, maybe the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto that cell to eat it.\n\nBut if I'm already there, perhaps I need to move onto it in my next move.\n\nWait, in Snake games, you move to an adjacent cell to eat the apple.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple at (5,5), maybe I need to move onto it, which would extend my snake.\n\nBut in reality, in Snake games, the apple is on the cell you move into, and eating it makes your snake longer.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple at (5,5), moving onto (5,5) would make me eat the apple and grow.\n\nBut, if I'm already on (5,5), maybe I need to move to an adjacent cell to eat the apple.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nBut in this setup, I'm at (5,5), and the apple is also at (5,5). Maybe the board notation is confusing.\n\nLet's assume that moving onto (5,5) from my current position would make me eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple is at (0,5) and (5,5), and I'm at (5,5).\n\nIn that case, moving onto (5,5) would make me eat the apple.\n\nBut, in Snake games, you can't stay in the same place; you must move to an adjacent cell.\n\nSo, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet's look back at the board:\n\nRow 5: A . . . T 2 . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, 'A' at (0,5), 'T' at (4,5), '2' at (5,5).\n\nSo, apple at (0,5), my tail at (4,5), and head at (5,5).\n\nWait, but according to the initial information, my snake is at (5,5), and the apple is also at (5,5). There might be a mismatch in notation.\n\nTo clarify:\n\n- My snake is at (5,5).\n\n- There is an apple at (5,5).\n\n- My tail is at (4,5).\n\nSo, if I move to (5,5), I should eat the apple and grow.\n\nBut in Snake games, moving onto the apple extends the snake by one segment.\n\nTherefore, if I move onto the apple at (5,5), my snake grows, and my tail remains where it was.\n\nWait, no. When you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail stays in place, and your head moves to the new cell.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and I move to (5,5), that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nBut I'm already on (5,5). Maybe the apple is still there, and moving onto it counts as eating it.\n\nIn that case, moving to (5,5) from (5,5) doesn't make sense because I can't stay in place.\n\nSo, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nBut I'm already on (5,5), so maybe I need to move to another adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the apple is at (5,5), and moving onto it from an adjacent cell allows me to eat it.\n\nBut since I'm already on (5,5), perhaps I need to move to another cell to eat it.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple remains until I move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nI think I need to clarify the rules of this specific Snake game.\n\nAssuming that moving onto the apple from an adjacent cell causes me to eat it, and since I'm already on (5,5), maybe I need to move to (5,5) from an adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nBut that seems odd because I'm already on (5,5).\n\nMaybe the apple disappears once I'm on it, or perhaps I need to move onto it from a different direction to eat it.\n\nTo simplify, perhaps I should consider that moving onto (5,5) from an adjacent cell allows me to eat the apple.\n\nGiven that, I need to move to (5,5) from, say, (4,5), to eat the apple.\n\nBut I'm already at (5,5), so maybe I need to move to another adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should consider the apple at (5,5) as already eaten or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are two apples: one at (0,5) and one at (5,5).\n\nLooking back, the initial information says apples are at (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0).\n\nBut the board shows an 'A' at (0,5) and (5,5), and 'T' and '2' at (5,5).\n\nMaybe there's only one apple at (0,5), and I'm at (5,5) with 'T' and '2' overlapping.\n\nThis is unclear. Perhaps I should proceed with the list of apple positions:"

The apple at (3,7) is the closest with a distance of 3.\n\nBut I should also consider the position of the enemy snake. Enemy snake 1 is at (8,2). I need to make sure that my path to the apple doesn't lead me into the enemy's path or a position where the enemy can easily cut me off.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (8,2), and I'm at (5,6). The apple at (3,7) is in the upper left direction from my current position. The enemy is in the lower right direction. So, moving towards (3,7) might take me away from the enemy, which is good.\n\nAdditionally, there are other apples at (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). I should think about a path that allows me to pick up more than one apple efficiently. But for now, let's focus on the closest apple at (3,7).\n\nTo get from (5,6) to (3,7), I need to move up twice and right once. So, possible moves:\n\n- UP to (4,6)\n\n- UP to (3,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nBut I need to make sure that these moves are safe and don't lead me into the enemy or a dead end.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (5,6), UP to (4,6):\n\n- Is (4,6) occupied? Doesn't seem so.\n\n- From (4,6), UP to (3,6):\n\n- Is (3,6) occupied? Doesn't seem so.\n\n- From (3,6), RIGHT to (3,7):\n\n- Is (3,7) occupied? It has an apple, so it's open.\n\nSo, this path seems clear. But I should also consider if the enemy might intercept me.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,2). If it moves UP, it goes to (7,2); then to (6,2); then to (5,2); and so on. It would take several moves for the enemy to reach my path.\n\nGiven that, it seems safe to proceed to (3,7).\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (3,7), I need to think about where to go next. The next closest apple would be (7,3), which is quite a distance away. I need to plan a path that avoids the enemy and doesn't lead me into a trap.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (0,5), which is also fairly distant. But considering the positions, going to (3,7) first and then to (7,3) might be a better strategy because they are somewhat aligned horizontally.\n\nWait, (3,7) and (7,3) are diagonally opposite, so maybe not the best sequence. Let's see:\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apple is likely (7,3), with a distance of |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, going to (0,5) from (3,7) would be |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nSo, (0,5) is closer from (3,7) than (7,3).\n\nBut (0,5) is also closer to the enemy's current position at (8,2). The distance for the enemy to (0,5) is |8-0| + |2-5| = 8 + 3 = 11.\n\nGiven that, and considering that I need to get to (0,5) from (3,7), which is 5 moves, and the enemy is 11 moves away from (0,5), it might still be safe.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that the enemy might change its path or grow longer, which could make it reach (0,5) faster.\n\nTo minimize risk, perhaps I should prioritize the apples that are farther from the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (0,5): 11 moves for the enemy\n\n- (3,7): |8-3| + |2-7| = 5 + 5 = 10 moves for the enemy\n\n- (7,3): |8-7| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2 moves for the enemy\n\n- (1,1): |8-1| + |2-1| = 7 + 1 = 8 moves for the enemy\n\n- (2,0): |8-2| + |2-0| = 6 + 2 = 8 moves for the enemy\n\nSo, the apple at (7,3) is only 2 moves away for the enemy. That's dangerous.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should avoid going to (7,3) for now and focus on (0,5) and (3,7), which are farther from the enemy.\n\nGiven that, going to (3,7) first, then to (0,5), might be a better strategy.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,7), I can then head to (0,5), which is 5 moves away, while the enemy would need 11 moves to get there.\n\nBut I need to consider that as I move, the enemy might also be moving towards the same apple, adjusting its path.\n\nTo be safe, perhaps I should consider picking up the apple at (0,5) first, as it's farther from the enemy and closer to my current position.\n\nWait, but (0,5) is at the top-left corner, and I'm at (5,6). The enemy is at (8,2), which is closer to (0,5) than I am.\n\nWait, no: my distance to (0,5) is |5-0| + |6-5| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves.\n\nEnemy's distance to (0,5) is |8-0| + |2-5| = 8 + 3 = 11 moves.\n\nSo, I am closer to (0,5) than the enemy is.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should aim for (0,5) directly from my current position.\n\nLet's calculate the path:\n\nFrom (5,6) to (0,5):\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,1)\n\n- Move UP to (4,1)\n\n-"

There are apples at positions (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (5,7).\n\nWait, in the board state, it shows my position at (5,7), but in the text, it says (5,6). Let me clarify that. Looking back, it says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,7)\", but in the board state, it shows '2' at row 5, column 6, which would be (5,6). There might be confusion here.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 7: . . . A . 2 . . . .\n\nSo, '2' is at column 6, row 7, which would be (7,6). Wait, that doesn't match. Let's double-check.\n\nWait, the board is labeled with row numbers decreasing from top to bottom:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . . A . 2 . . . .\n\n6 . . . . . T . . . .\n\n5 A . . . . . . . . .\n\n4 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n3 . . . . . . . A 1 .\n\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n1 . A . . . . . . . 1\n\n0 . . A . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, '2' is at row 7, column 6, which is (7,6). But earlier it was mentioned (5,7). There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps the coordinates are given as (row, column), not (x, y). In grid systems, sometimes it's (row, column). Let me check.\n\nIf (0,0) is bottom left, then increasing row numbers go up, and column numbers go right.\n\nSo, position (row, column):\n\n- (0,0) is bottom left\n\n- (9,9) is top right\n\nIn the board, '2' is at row 7, column 6, which would be (7,6).\n\nBut earlier, it was stated that the snake is at (5,7). This seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial information. I'll proceed with the board state, assuming '2' is at (7,6).\n\nSo, my position is (7,6).\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (3,7)\n\n- (7,3)\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (2,0)\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,3) with no body parts.\n\nOkay, with that clarified, I need to decide my next move.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,6) to each apple:\n\n- To (0,5): |7-0| + |6-5| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n- To (3,7): |7-3| + |6-7| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- To (7,3): |7-7| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n- To (1,1): |7-1| + |6-1| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- To (2,0): |7-2| + |6-0| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3), with a distance of 3.\n\nNext closest is (3,7) at distance 5, and (0,5) at distance 8.\n\nNow, I need to consider the position of the enemy snake. The enemy is at (8,3), which is close to me.\n\nI need to plan a path to the apple at (7,3) and ensure that I don't run into the enemy.\n\nLet's visualize the path:\n\nFrom (7,6) to (7,3):\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,3)\n\nI need to check if the enemy can intercept me on this path.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,3). If it moves UP to (7,3), it would directly conflict with my path.\n\nSo, that's a potential danger.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for the apple at (3,7), which is at a distance of 5.\n\nPath from (7,6) to (3,7):\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (5,6)\n\n- Move UP to (4,6)\n\n- Move UP to (3,6)\n\n- Move RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nThis path seems longer, but it takes me away from the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,3), and if it moves towards (3,7), it would need to move UP to (7,3), then LEFT to (7,2), and so on, which would take more moves.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (3,7) is safer.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,7), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nLet's think about the next apple to go for after (3,7).\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apples would be:\n\n- (7,3): |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (0,5): |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, (0,5) is closer.\n\nBut (0,5) is also relatively far from my current position, and the enemy is closer to (0,5) than I am.\n\nWait, no, earlier I saw that I am closer to (0,5) than the enemy.\n\nWait, let's recalculate distances:\n\nMy position: (7,6)\n\nApple at (0,5): |7-0| + |6-5| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nEnemy at (8,3) to (0,5): |8-0| + |3-5| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\nSo, the enemy is farther from (0,5) than I am.\n\nTherefore, perhaps going for (0,5) directly from my current position is safer, as the enemy has to cover more distance.\n\nLet's plan a path to (0,5):\n\nFrom (7,6) to (0,5):\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (5,6)\n\n- Move UP to (4,6)\n\n- Move UP to (3,6)\n\n- Move UP to (2,6)\n\n- Move UP to (1,6)\n\n- Move UP to (0,6)\n\n- Move LEFT to (0,5)\n\nThat's 7 moves up and 1 left, totaling 8 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy would need to move to (0,5), which is 10 moves away.\n\nSo, I can reach (0,5) before the enemy does.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that the enemy doesn't change its path to intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider picking up the apple at (3,7) first, then go to (0,5).\n\nBut that would take me 5 moves to (3,7) and then 5 more moves to (0,5), totaling 10 moves, while directly going to (0,5) is 8 moves.\n\nSo, going directly to (0,5) is more efficient.\n\nAlso, after eating (0,5), I can consider going for another apple.\n\nFrom (0,5), the closest apples would be:\n\n- (1,1): |0-1| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- (2,0): |0-2| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nSo, (1,1) is closest.\n\nBut (1,1) is also close to the enemy's starting position.\n\nWait, enemy is at (8,3). Distance to (1,1):\n\n|8-1| + |3-1| = 7 + 2 = 9 moves.\n\nSo, from (0,5), I can go to (1,1) in 5 moves, while the enemy would need 9 moves to get there.\n\nThat seems safe.\n\nAfter that, the remaining apples are (3,7) and (7,3).\n\nFrom (1,1), to (3,7):\n\n|1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\nTo (7,3): |1-7| + |1-3| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, both are equidistant.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (3,7) next.\n\nBut considering the enemy's position"

The idea is to get there without encountering the enemy snake #2 that is currently at (5,8). The enemy snake is closer to the apples at the top but could potentially move towards the ones at the bottom. My plan still holds to move towards the apple at (3,7) after I consume the one at (7,3) thus staying clear of the bottom half of the board where the enemy snake might be.

So, the options are either to move DOWN or LEFT. In both cases, I'll be 1 step away from the apple. I'll move LEFT as that would also bring me closer to the apple at (3,7) which is part of my next strategy once the apple at (7,3) is consumed.\n\nStrategy for Next Turn: Keep a close eye on the enemy snake's movement.

I'll go with the board state, so my position is (7,6).\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,2) with no body parts.\n\nOkay, so I need to decide my next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple to go for.

Next is (3,7) at distance 5, and (0,5) at distance 8. The others are farther.\n\nNow, I need to consider the enemy snake's position at (8,2). That's somewhat close to the apple at (7,3), as the enemy would need to move to (7,2) and then to (7,3), which is a distance of 1 + 1 = 2 moves.\n\nWait, but I need to think about the timing. If I move towards (7,3), and the enemy moves towards (7,3) as well, they might get there before me.\n\nWait, no. I'm closer to (7,3) than the enemy is. I'm at (7,6), so it's 3 moves away, and the enemy is at (8,2), which is 2 moves away to (7,2) and then one more to (7,3), totaling 3 moves as well.\n\nSo, we might reach (7,3) at the same time if we both go for it.\n\nBut I need to consider that if both snakes reach the apple at the same time, probably only one will get it, and perhaps the one that reaches first, or maybe it's undefined. To play it safe, I should consider that the enemy might get to (7,3) before me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can plan a path that allows me to get to (7,3) before the enemy.\n\nLet's think about possible paths.\n\nFrom (7,6) to (7,3):\n\n- LEFT to (7,5)\n\n- LEFT to (7,4)\n\n- LEFT to (7,3)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nEnemy from (8,2) to (7,3):\n\n- UP to (7,2)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,3)\n\nThat's 2 moves.\n\nWait, that's faster than my 3 moves. So, the enemy can get to (7,3) in 2 moves, while I need 3. That means the enemy will reach first unless I can interfere or find a different path.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider going for (3,7) instead, which is at a distance of 5.\n\nFrom (7,6) to (3,7):\n\n- UP to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (5,6)\n\n- UP to (4,6)\n\n- UP to (3,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nEnemy from (8,2) to (3,7):\n\n- UP to (7,2)\n\n- UP to (6,2)\n\n- UP to (5,2)\n\n- UP to (4,2)\n\n- UP to (3,2)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nThat's 2 moves up and then 5 moves right, totaling 7 moves.\n\nSo, in this case, I can reach (3,7) in 5 moves, and the enemy would take 7 moves, so I reach first.\n\nAfter eating (3,7), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apples are:\n\n- (0,5): |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (7,3): |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (1,1): |3-1| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- (2,0): |3-2| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nSo, (0,5) is the closest at 5 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy, after moving 7 moves to (3,7), would have to go to another apple.\n\nBut since I'm already at (3,7), and assuming I eat it, I can move to (0,5) before the enemy can get there.\n\nFrom (3,7) to (0,5):\n\n- LEFT to (3,6)\n\n- LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,2)\n\n- LEFT to (3,1)\n\n- LEFT to (3,0)\n\n- DOWN to (4,0)\n\n- DOWN to (5,0)\n\n- DOWN to (6,0)\n\n- DOWN to (7,0)\n\n- DOWN to (8,0)\n\n- DOWN to (9,0)\n\nWait, that seems inefficient.

Move to (3,7) via UP,UP,UP,UP,RIGHT.\n\n2. Eat the apple at (3,7).\n\n3. Move to (0,5) via UP,UP,UP,LEFT,LEFT.\n\nTotal moves: 5 + 5 = 10 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy starts at (8,2):\n\n- Moves to (7,2)\n\n- Moves to (6,2)\n\n- Moves to (5,2)\n\n- Moves to (4,2)\n\n- Moves to (3,2)\n\n- Moves to (3,3)\n\n- Moves to (3,4)\n\n- Moves to (3,5)\n\n- Moves to (3,6)\n\n- Moves to (3,7)\n\nThat's 7 moves to reach (3,7), but I've already eaten it by then.\n\nThen, the enemy would have to go for another apple.\n\nSo, perhaps this is a viable strategy.\n\nAfter eating (0,5), the closest apples are (1,1) and (2,0), both at a distance of 5 moves.\n\nFrom (0,5) to (1,1):\n\n- DOWN to (1,5)\n\n- DOWN to (2,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- DOWN to (5,5)\n\n- DOWN to (6,5)\n\n- DOWN to (7,5)\n\n- DOWN to (8,5)\n\n- RIGHT to"

Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can take a diagonal path, but in this game, snakes can't move diagonally, only UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nSo, 6 moves to reach (3,7).

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (4,5). There are apples at (0,5), (5,5), (3,7), (7,3), and (1,1). Oh, and there's an enemy snake number 1 at (9,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . 2 A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . A . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (4,5), which is in row 5, column 4.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (0,5): row 5, column 0\n\n- (5,5): row 5, column 5\n\n- (3,7): row 7, column 3\n\n- (7,3): row 3, column 7\n\n- (1,1): row 1, column 1\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (9,1), which is row 1, column 9.\n\nOkay, I need to think about which apple to go for. I should consider which one is closest and which one poses the least risk.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\nTo (0,5):\n\nDistance = |4-0| + |5-5| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nTo (5,5):\n\nDistance = |4-5| + |5-5| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nTo (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |5-7| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nTo (7,3):\n\nDistance = |4-7| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nTo (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5), only 1 step away.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if there are any obstacles or enemies in that direction.\n\nLooking at the board, (5,5) is right next to me, to my right.\n\nIs there any part of my snake or the enemy snake there? From the board, it's just an apple, so it should be safe to move there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. But since I'm currently just the head at (4,5), my new position would be (5,5), and my tail would be at (4,5).\n\nNow, what's next? There are still apples at (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), and (1,1).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to eat as many apples as possible without running into walls, enemies, or myself.\n\nLet's think about the positions:\n\nFrom (5,5), I can see the apple at (0,5) is directly to my left, 5 steps away.\n\nThe apple at (3,7) is up and to the left.\n\n(7,3) is down and to the right.\n\n(1,1) is down and to the left.\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake at (9,1). I should keep an eye on its movement, but since it's only the head with no body parts, it might be less threatening for now.\n\nBut in this turn, I need to decide where to go.\n\nOption 1: Go right to (5,5), eat the apple, then plan to go left towards (0,5).\n\nOption 2: Go up towards (3,7).\n\nOption 3: Go down towards (7,3) or (1,1).\n\nHmm.\n\nGoing right to (5,5) seems straightforward, as it's only one step away.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can consider moving left towards (0,5).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), moving left to (4,5) is my tail, which is now at (4,5) after I eat the apple at (5,5).\n\nWait, no. After eating the apple at (5,5), my head moves to (5,5), and my tail remains at (4,5). So, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) would be moving into my own tail, which would cause me to die.\n\nOh no, that's a problem.\n\nSo, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (5,5), because my tail is there.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail extends, so your tail remains where it was, and you grow by one segment.\n\nSo, in this case, after eating the apple at (5,5), my body would be:\n\nHead at (5,5), previous head at (4,5).\n\nSo, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) would be moving into my own body, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (5,5).\n\nSo, maybe I should consider another direction.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,5), I can move up or down.\n\nLet's see:\n\nMoving up from (5,5) to (5,6). Is there anything there? From the board, it's empty.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can continue up to (5,7), where there's an apple at (3,7), but that's not directly up.\n\nWait, (3,7) is at column 3, row 7.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving up to (5,6), then (5,7), but that's column 5, row 7.\n\nThe apple is at column 3, row 7.\n\nSo, I would need to move left from (5,7) to (4,7), then to (3,7) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (0,5), but as we saw, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) is into my own body.\n\nSo, maybe I should move right from (5,5) to (6,5).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), move right to (6,5), which is empty.\n\nThen, I can continue moving left back to (5,5), then (4,5), but wait, my tail would be moving, so I need to be careful.\n\nActually, in Snake games, each move advances the head and the tail moves to where the previous head was.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (5,5), my body is now two segments: head at (5,5), and tail at (4,5).\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), my new body would be head at (6,5), and previous head at (5,5).\n\nThen, if I move left to (5,5), I'm moving into my own body, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, no. In Snake, you can't move back to the previous position immediately, because your tail is there.\n\nBut in this case, after eating the apple, my body is head at (5,5), and tail at (4,5).\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), then my body becomes head at (6,5), and tail at (5,5).\n\nThen, if I move left to (5,5), I'm moving into my tail, which is now at (5,5).\n\nSo, that's still not allowed.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need to choose a different path.\n\nMaybe I should consider moving up from (5,5) to (5,6), then (5,7), then left to (4,7), then (3,7) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, rows 6 and 7 seem empty in column 5.\n\nSo, from (5,5), up to (5,6), then (5,7), then left to (4,7), then (3,7) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (7,3), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,5), down to (5,4), then (5,3), then right to"

Therefore, moving UP is a better choice.\n\nThe apple at (3,7) is also a less risky option after obtaining the one at (7,3) as the path towards it is clear and devoid of any enemy snakes.

Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at positions (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (5,5). There's an enemy snake, ID 1, at (8,1) with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout based on the given state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . .

The 'T' might represent the tail, but since I just started, maybe it's just notation. There's an apple at (0,5), which is in the same row but column 0.\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are several factors to consider:\n\n1. **Proximity**: Which apple is closest to my current position.\n\n2. **Safety**: Ensuring I don't run into walls, enemy snakes, or myself.\n\n3. **Future Path**: Planning a path that allows me to pick up multiple apples efficiently.\n\nLet's list out the distances to each apple using Manhattan distance, which is suitable for grid movements without diagonals.\n\n- To (0,5): |5-0| + |5-5| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n- To (3,7): |5-3| + |5-7| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (7,3): |5-7| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (1,1): |5-1| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- To (2,0): |5-2| + |5-0| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (3,7) and (7,3), both with a distance of 4.\n\nBut wait, there's also an apple at (0,5) which is distance 5, and another at (5,5), which seems to be where I am now. Wait, the board shows an 'A' at (0,5) and (5,5), and 'T' and '2' at (5,5). Maybe there's confusion in notation.\n\nLooking back, the board shows:\n\nRow 5: A . . . T 2 . . . .\n\nSo, 'A' at column 0, 'T' and '2' at column 5. Probably 'T' is the tail, and '2' is my head.\n\nSo, there is an apple at (0,5) and another at (5,5), where I am now. Wait, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple there, do I automatically eat it by staying put? Probably not; I need to move to a new cell to eat the apple.\n\nHmm, maybe the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto that cell to eat it.\n\nBut if I'm already there, perhaps I need to move onto it in my next move.\n\nWait, in Snake games, you move to an adjacent cell to eat the apple.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple at (5,5), maybe I need to move onto it, which would extend my snake.\n\nBut in reality, in Snake games, the apple is on the cell you move into, and eating it makes your snake longer.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple at (5,5), moving onto (5,5) would make me eat the apple and grow.\n\nBut, if I'm already on (5,5), maybe I need to move to an adjacent cell to eat the apple.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nBut in this setup, I'm at (5,5), and the apple is also at (5,5). Maybe the board notation is confusing.\n\nLet's assume that moving onto (5,5) from my current position would make me eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple is at (0,5) and (5,5), and I'm at (5,5).\n\nIn that case, moving onto (5,5) would make me eat the apple.\n\nBut, in Snake games, you can't stay in the same place; you must move to an adjacent cell.\n\nSo, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet's look back at the board:\n\nRow 5: A . . . T 2 . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, 'A' at (0,5), 'T' at (4,5), '2' at (5,5).\n\nSo, apple at (0,5), my tail at (4,5), and head at (5,5).\n\nWait, but according to the initial information, my snake is at (5,5), and the apple is also at (5,5). There might be a mismatch in notation.\n\nTo clarify:\n\n- My snake is at (5,5).\n\n- There is an apple at (5,5).\n\n- My tail is at (4,5).\n\nSo, if I move to (5,5), I should eat the apple and grow.\n\nBut in Snake games, moving onto the apple extends the snake by one segment.\n\nTherefore, if I move onto the apple at (5,5), my snake grows, and my tail remains where it was.\n\nWait, no. When you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail stays in place, and your head moves to the new cell.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and I move to (5,5), that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nBut I'm already on (5,5). Maybe the apple is still there, and moving onto it counts as eating it.\n\nIn that case, moving to (5,5) from (5,5) doesn't make sense because I can't stay in place.\n\nSo, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nBut I'm already on (5,5), so maybe I need to move to another adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the apple is at (5,5), and moving onto it from an adjacent cell allows me to eat it.\n\nBut since I'm already on (5,5), perhaps I need to move to another cell to eat it.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple remains until I move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nI think I need to clarify the rules of this specific Snake game.\n\nAssuming that moving onto the apple from an adjacent cell causes me to eat it, and since I'm already on (5,5), maybe I need to move to (5,5) from an adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nBut that seems odd because I'm already on (5,5).\n\nMaybe the apple disappears once I'm on it, or perhaps I need to move onto it from a different direction to eat it.\n\nTo simplify, perhaps I should consider that moving onto (5,5) from an adjacent cell allows me to eat the apple.\n\nGiven that, I need to move to (5,5) from, say, (4,5), to eat the apple.\n\nBut I'm already at (5,5), so maybe I need to move to another adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should consider the apple at (5,5) as already eaten or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are two apples: one at (0,5) and one at (5,5).\n\nLooking back, the initial information says apples are at (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0).\n\nBut the board shows an 'A' at (0,5) and (5,5), and 'T' and '2' at (5,5).\n\nMaybe there's only one apple at (0,5), and I'm at (5,5) with 'T' and '2' overlapping.\n\nThis is unclear. Perhaps I should proceed with the list of apple positions:"

I need to make sure that my path to the apple doesn't lead me into the enemy's path or a position where the enemy can easily cut me off.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (8,2), and I'm at (5,6).

So, possible moves:\n\n- UP to (4,6)\n\n- UP to (3,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nBut I need to make sure that these moves are safe and don't lead me into the enemy or a dead end.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (5,6), UP to (4,6):\n\n- Is (4,6) occupied? Doesn't seem so.\n\n- From (4,6), UP to (3,6):\n\n- Is (3,6) occupied? Doesn't seem so.\n\n- From (3,6), RIGHT to (3,7):\n\n- Is (3,7) occupied? It has an apple, so it's open.\n\nSo, this path seems clear. But I should also consider if the enemy might intercept me.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,2). If it moves UP, it goes to (7,2); then to (6,2); then to (5,2); and so on. It would take several moves for the enemy to reach my path.\n\nGiven that, it seems safe to proceed to (3,7).\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (3,7), I need to think about where to go next. The next closest apple would be (7,3), which is quite a distance away. I need to plan a path that avoids the enemy and doesn't lead me into a trap.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (0,5), which is also fairly distant. But considering the positions, going to (3,7) first and then to (7,3) might be a better strategy because they are somewhat aligned horizontally.\n\nWait, (3,7) and (7,3) are diagonally opposite, so maybe not the best sequence. Let's see:\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apple is likely (7,3), with a distance of |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, going to (0,5) from (3,7) would be |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nSo, (0,5) is closer from (3,7) than (7,3).\n\nBut (0,5) is also closer to the enemy's current position at (8,2). The distance for the enemy to (0,5) is |8-0| + |2-5| = 8 + 3 = 11.\n\nGiven that, and considering that I need to get to (0,5) from (3,7), which is 5 moves, and the enemy is 11 moves away from (0,5), it might still be safe.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that the enemy might change its path or grow longer, which could make it reach (0,5) faster.\n\nTo minimize risk, perhaps I should prioritize the apples that are farther from the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (0,5): 11 moves for the enemy\n\n- (3,7): |8-3| + |2-7| = 5 + 5 = 10 moves for the enemy\n\n- (7,3): |8-7| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2 moves for the enemy\n\n- (1,1): |8-1| + |2-1| = 7 + 1 = 8 moves for the enemy\n\n- (2,0): |8-2| + |2-0| = 6 + 2 = 8 moves for the enemy\n\nSo, the apple at (7,3) is only 2 moves away for the enemy. That's dangerous.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should avoid going to (7,3) for now and focus on (0,5) and (3,7), which are farther from the enemy.\n\nGiven that, going to (3,7) first, then to (0,5), might be a better strategy.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,7), I can then head to (0,5), which is 5 moves away, while the enemy would need 11 moves to get there.\n\nBut I need to consider that as I move, the enemy might also be moving towards the same apple, adjusting its path.\n\nTo be safe, perhaps I should consider picking up the apple at (0,5) first, as it's farther from the enemy and closer to my current position.\n\nWait, but (0,5) is at the top-left corner, and I'm at (5,6). The enemy is at (8,2), which is closer to (0,5) than I am.\n\nWait, no: my distance to (0,5) is |5-0| + |6-5| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves.\n\nEnemy's distance to (0,5) is |8-0| + |2-5| = 8 + 3 = 11 moves.\n\nSo, I am closer to (0,5) than the enemy is.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should aim for (0,5) directly from my current position.\n\nLet's calculate the path:\n\nFrom (5,6) to (0,5):\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,1)\n\n- Move UP to (4,1)\n\n-"

Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at positions (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (5,7).\n\nWait, in the board state, it shows my position at (5,7), but in the text, it says (5,6). Let me clarify that. Looking back, it says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (5,7)\", but in the board state, it shows '2' at row 5, column 6, which would be (5,6). There might be confusion here.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 7: . . . A . 2 . . . .\n\nSo, '2' is at column 6, row 7, which would be (7,6). Wait, that doesn't match. Let's double-check.\n\nWait, the board is labeled with row numbers decreasing from top to bottom:\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . . A . 2 . . . .\n\n6 . . . . .

There's a discrepancy here.\n\nWait, perhaps the coordinates are given as (row, column), not (x, y). In grid systems, sometimes it's (row, column). Let me check.\n\nIf (0,0) is bottom left, then increasing row numbers go up, and column numbers go right.\n\nSo, position (row, column):\n\n- (0,0) is bottom left\n\n- (9,9) is top right\n\nIn the board, '2' is at row 7, column 6, which would be (7,6).\n\nBut earlier, it was stated that the snake is at (5,7). This seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a mistake in the initial information. I'll proceed with the board state, assuming '2' is at (7,6).\n\nSo, my position is (7,6).\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (0,5)\n\n- (3,7)\n\n- (7,3)\n\n- (1,1)\n\n- (2,0)\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,3) with no body parts.\n\nOkay, with that clarified, I need to decide my next move.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,6) to each apple:\n\n- To (0,5): |7-0| + |6-5| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n- To (3,7): |7-3| + |6-7| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- To (7,3): |7-7| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n- To (1,1): |7-1| + |6-1| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- To (2,0): |7-2| + |6-0| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3), with a distance of 3.\n\nNext closest is (3,7) at distance 5, and (0,5) at distance 8.\n\nNow, I need to consider the position of the enemy snake. The enemy is at (8,3), which is close to me.\n\nI need to plan a path to the apple at (7,3) and ensure that I don't run into the enemy.\n\nLet's visualize the path:\n\nFrom (7,6) to (7,3):\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,3)\n\nI need to check if the enemy can intercept me on this path.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,3). If it moves UP to (7,3), it would directly conflict with my path.\n\nSo, that's a potential danger.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for the apple at (3,7), which is at a distance of 5.\n\nPath from (7,6) to (3,7):\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (5,6)\n\n- Move UP to (4,6)\n\n- Move UP to (3,6)\n\n- Move RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nThis path seems longer, but it takes me away from the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,3), and if it moves towards (3,7), it would need to move UP to (7,3), then LEFT to (7,2), and so on, which would take more moves.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (3,7) is safer.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,7), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nLet's think about the next apple to go for after (3,7).\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apples would be:\n\n- (7,3): |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (0,5): |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, (0,5) is closer.\n\nBut (0,5) is also relatively far from my current position, and the enemy is closer to (0,5) than I am.\n\nWait, no, earlier I saw that I am closer to (0,5) than the enemy.\n\nWait, let's recalculate distances:\n\nMy position: (7,6)\n\nApple at (0,5): |7-0| + |6-5| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nEnemy at (8,3) to (0,5): |8-0| + |3-5| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\nSo, the enemy is farther from (0,5) than I am.\n\nTherefore, perhaps going for (0,5) directly from my current position is safer, as the enemy has to cover more distance.\n\nLet's plan a path to (0,5):\n\nFrom (7,6) to (0,5):\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (5,6)\n\n- Move UP to (4,6)\n\n- Move UP to (3,6)\n\n- Move UP to (2,6)\n\n- Move UP to (1,6)\n\n- Move UP to (0,6)\n\n- Move LEFT to (0,5)\n\nThat's 7 moves up and 1 left, totaling 8 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy would need to move to (0,5), which is 10 moves away.\n\nSo, I can reach (0,5) before the enemy does.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that the enemy doesn't change its path to intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider picking up the apple at (3,7) first, then go to (0,5).\n\nBut that would take me 5 moves to (3,7) and then 5 more moves to (0,5), totaling 10 moves, while directly going to (0,5) is 8 moves.\n\nSo, going directly to (0,5) is more efficient.\n\nAlso, after eating (0,5), I can consider going for another apple.\n\nFrom (0,5), the closest apples would be:\n\n- (1,1): |0-1| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- (2,0): |0-2| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nSo, (1,1) is closest.\n\nBut (1,1) is also close to the enemy's starting position.\n\nWait, enemy is at (8,3). Distance to (1,1):\n\n|8-1| + |3-1| = 7 + 2 = 9 moves.\n\nSo, from (0,5), I can go to (1,1) in 5 moves, while the enemy would need 9 moves to get there.\n\nThat seems safe.\n\nAfter that, the remaining apples are (3,7) and (7,3).\n\nFrom (1,1), to (3,7):\n\n|1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\nTo (7,3): |1-7| + |1-3| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, both are equidistant.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (3,7) next.\n\nBut considering the enemy's position"

So, the enemy can get to (7,3) in 2 moves, while I need 3. That means the enemy will reach first unless I can interfere or find a different path.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider going for (3,7) instead, which is at a distance of 5.\n\nFrom (7,6) to (3,7):\n\n- UP to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (5,6)\n\n- UP to (4,6)\n\n- UP to (3,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nEnemy from (8,2) to (3,7):\n\n- UP to (7,2)\n\n- UP to (6,2)\n\n- UP to (5,2)\n\n- UP to (4,2)\n\n- UP to (3,2)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nThat's 2 moves up and then 5 moves right, totaling 7 moves.\n\nSo, in this case, I can reach (3,7) in 5 moves, and the enemy would take 7 moves, so I reach first.\n\nAfter eating (3,7), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apples are:\n\n- (0,5): |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (7,3): |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (1,1): |3-1| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- (2,0): |3-2| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nSo, (0,5) is the closest at 5 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy, after moving 7 moves to (3,7), would have to go to another apple.\n\nBut since I'm already at (3,7), and assuming I eat it, I can move to (0,5) before the enemy can get there.\n\nFrom (3,7) to (0,5):\n\n- LEFT to (3,6)\n\n- LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,2)\n\n- LEFT to (3,1)\n\n- LEFT to (3,0)\n\n- DOWN to (4,0)\n\n- DOWN to (5,0)\n\n- DOWN to (6,0)\n\n- DOWN to (7,0)\n\n- DOWN to (8,0)\n\n- DOWN to (9,0)\n\nWait, that seems inefficient.

There are multiple apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (8,6) to each apple:\n\n- To (0,5): |8-0| + |6-5| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n- To (3,7): |8-3| + |6-7| = 5 + 1 = 6\n\n- To (7,3): |8-7| + |6-3| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- To (1,1): |8-1| + |6-1| = 7 + 5 = 12\n\n- To (2,0): |8-2| + |6-0| = 6 + 6 = 12\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3), distance 4. Next is (3,7) at distance 6, and (0,5) at distance 9. The others are farther.\n\nNow, I need to consider the enemy snake's position at (7,2). That's somewhat close to the apple at (7,3), as the enemy would need to move to (7,3), which is only 1 move away.\n\nWait, but I'm at (8,6), and the enemy is at (7,2). If I go to (7,3), I need to move to (7,6), then (7,5), (7,4), (7,3). That's 3 moves.\n\nWait, let's clarify:\n\nFrom (8,6):\n\n- UP to (7,6)\n\n- LEFT to (7,5)\n\n- LEFT to (7,4)\n\n- LEFT to (7,3)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,2):\n\n- RIGHT to (7,3)\n\nThat's 1 move.\n\nSo, the enemy can reach (7,3) in 1 move, while I need 3 moves. That means the enemy will get there first and eat the apple.\n\nHmm, that's a problem. So, going for (7,3) isn't a good idea because the enemy can intercept me quickly.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (3,7).\n\nFrom (8,6):\n\n- UP to (7,6)\n\n- UP to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (5,6)\n\n- UP to (4,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (4,7)\n\n- UP to (3,7)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,2):\n\n- UP to (6,2)\n\n- UP to (5,2)\n\n- UP to (4,2)\n\n- UP to (3,2)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nThat's 8 moves.\n\nSo, I can reach (3,7) in 5 moves, and the enemy would take 8 moves, so I reach first.\n\nAfter eating (3,7), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apples are:\n\n- (0,5): |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (7,3): |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (1,1): |3-1| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- (2,0): |3-2| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nSo, (0,5) is the closest at 5 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy, after moving 8 moves to (3,7), would have to go to another apple.\n\nBut since I'm already at (3,7), and assuming I eat it, I can move to (0,5) before the enemy can get there.\n\nFrom (3,7) to (0,5):\n\n- UP to (2,7)\n\n- UP to (1,7)\n\n- UP to (0,7)\n\n- LEFT to (0,6)\n\n- LEFT to (0,5)\n\nThat's 3 UP and 2 LEFT, totaling 5 moves.\n\nDuring this time, the enemy would have to move from (3,7) to (0,5). But I'm already at (3,7) after 5 moves, and the enemy is still on their way.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think in terms of the sequence of moves.\n\nLet's outline a sequence:\n\n1. Move to (7,6): UP\n\n2. Move to (6,6): UP\n\n3. Move to (5,6): UP\n\n4. Move to (4,6): UP\n\n5. Move to (4,7): RIGHT\n\n6. Move to (3,7): UP\n\nAt this point, I've reached (3,7) in 6 moves, but according to earlier calculation, it should be 5 moves. Maybe I miscounted.\n\nWait, let's recount:\n\nFrom (8,6):\n\n- Move 1: UP to (7,6)\n\n- Move 2: UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move 3: UP to (5,6)\n\n- Move 4: UP to (4,6)\n\n- Move 5: RIGHT to (4,7)\n\n- Move 6: UP to (3,7)\n\nYes, it's 6 moves. Hmm, perhaps I need to optimize the path.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,6):\n\n- UP to (7,6)\n\n- UP to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (5,6)\n\n- UP to (4,6)\n\n- UP to (3,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nThat's still 6 moves.\n\nWait, maybe there's a better path.\n\nWait, perhaps from (4,6), move RIGHT to (4,7), then UP to (3,7). That's 5 moves.\n\n- Move 1: UP to (7,6)\n\n- Move 2: UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move 3: UP to (5,6)\n\n- Move 4: UP to (4,6)\n\n- Move 5: RIGHT to (4,7)\n\n- Move 6: UP to (3,7)\n\nWait, that's still 6 moves. Unless...\n\nWait, maybe from (4,6), move RIGHT to (4,7), then UP to (3,7). That's 5 moves from (8,6):\n\n- Move 1: UP to (7,6)\n\n- Move 2: UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move 3: UP to (5,6)\n\n- Move 4: UP to (4,6)\n\n- Move 5: RIGHT to (4,7)\n\n- Move 6: UP to (3,7)\n\nYes, it's 6 moves. Maybe I made a mistake earlier.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can take a diagonal path, but in this game, snakes can't move diagonally, only UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nSo, 6 moves to reach (3,7). The enemy is at (7,2):\n\n- Move 1: RIGHT to (7,3)\n\n- Move 2: RIGHT to (7,4)\n\n- Move 3: RIGHT to (7,5)\n\n- Move 4: RIGHT to (7,6)\n\n- Move 5: RIGHT to (7,7)\n\n- Move 6: RIGHT to (7,8)\n\n-"

Let's see the current setup.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (7,8).\n\nWait, in the board state, it shows my position at (7,8), but in the text, it says (6,8). There might be a confusion here.

I'll go with the board state, so my position is (8,7).\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,3) with body at (7,2).\n\nOkay, so I need to decide my next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (8,7) to each apple:\n\n- To (0,5): |8-0| + |7-5| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\n- To (3,7): |8-3| + |7-7| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n- To (1,1): |8-1| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- To (2,0): |8-2| + |7-0| = 6 + 7 = 13\n\n- To (7,3): |8-7| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (3,7) and (7,3), both at a distance of 5.\n\nNow, I need to consider the enemy snake's position at (7,3) with body at (7,2). If I go for the apple at (7,3), I have to pass through (7,3), but the enemy is already there. So, that might not be safe.\n\nLet's think about going for the apple at (3,7).\n\nFrom (8,7), I can move UP to (7,7), then (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7). That's 5 moves.\n\nDuring these moves, the enemy is at (7,3), and its body is at (7,2). So, the enemy is moving somewhere, but I don't know its direction yet.\n\nAssuming the enemy is moving towards me or towards an apple, I need to predict its path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the enemy is moving towards the apple at (7,3), which is adjacent to it.\n\nIf I go for (3,7), the enemy might stay put or move elsewhere, but I need to make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (7,3), but that's risky because the enemy is already there.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (7,3), and its body is at (7,2). So, it's probably moving towards me or towards another apple.\n\nI need to consider that if I move towards (7,3), I might collide with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can lure the enemy towards (7,3), eat the apple, and then move away.\n\nBut that sounds dangerous. Maybe I should avoid that.\n\nLet me consider going for the apple at (3,7). It's at (3,7), and I'm at (8,7). So, I need to move UP 5 times.\n\nDuring these moves, the enemy might move towards me or towards another apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (0,5), which is at (0,5). That's farther, but perhaps safer.\n\nLet's calculate the distance to (0,5):\n\nFrom (8,7):\n\n- DOWN to (7,7)\n\n- DOWN to (6,7)\n\n- DOWN to (5,7)\n\n- DOWN to (4,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,6)\n\n- LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,2)\n\n- LEFT to (3,1)\n\n- LEFT to (3,0)\n\n- UP to (2,0)\n\n- UP to (1,0)\n\n- UP to (0,0)\n\n- RIGHT to (0,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (0,2)\n\n- RIGHT to (0,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (0,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (0,5)\n\nThat's way too many moves. Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, perhaps a better path:\n\nFrom (8,7):\n\n- DOWN to (7,7)\n\n- DOWN to (6,7)\n\n- DOWN to (5,7)\n\n- DOWN to (4,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,7)\n\n- DOWN to (2,7)\n\n- DOWN to (1,7)\n\n- DOWN to (0,7)\n\n- LEFT to (0,6)\n\n- LEFT to (0,5)\n\nThat's 9 moves.\n\nBut that's too many moves, and the enemy can reach apples faster.\n\nMaybe I should prioritize closer apples.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (3,7) again.\n\nFrom (8,7):\n\n- DOWN to (7,7)\n\n- DOWN to (6,7)\n\n- DOWN to (5,7)\n\n- DOWN to (4,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,7)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nDuring these moves, the enemy is at (7,3), and its body is at (7,2).\n\nIf the enemy moves towards me, it would have to move UP to (6,3), then (5,3), etc., which would take more moves.\n\nAlternatively, if the enemy moves towards the apple at (3,7), it would have to move UP to (6,3), then (5,3), etc., which would still take several moves.\n\nSo, I might be able to reach (3,7) before the enemy does.\n\nAfter eating (3,7), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apples are:\n\n- (0,5): |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (7,3): |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (1,1): |3-1| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- (2,0): |3-2| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nSo, (0,5) is the closest at 5 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy would have to move from (7,3) to (3,7), which is |7-3| + |3-7| = 4 + 4 = 8 moves.\n\nSo, I can reach (0,5) after eating (3,7) before the enemy can catch up.\n\nTherefore, my plan is:\n\n1. Move to (3,7):\n\n- DOWN to (7,7)\n\n- DOWN to (6,7)\n\n- DOWN to (5,7)\n\n- DOWN to (4,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,7)\n\n2. Eat the apple at (3,7), growing longer.\n\n3. Then move to (0,5):\n\n- DOWN to (2,7)\n\n- DOWN to (1,7)\n\n- DOWN to (0,7)\n\n- LEFT to (0,6)\n\n- LEFT to (0,5)\n\nDuring these moves, the enemy would have to move towards me, but it would take more moves, so I should be safe.\n\nAfter eating (0,5), I can consider going for another apple.\n\nBut for now, focusing on (3,7) seems like a good strategy.\n\nSo, for my next move, I should move DOWN to (7,7).\n\nWait, but looking at my current position at (8,7), moving DOWN would be towards (9,7), which is off the board. So, that's invalid.\n\nWait, in this game, decreasing y-coordinate is down, and increasing y-coordinate is up.\n\nSo, from (8,7), moving DOWN would be to (7,7), not (9,7). Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the coordinate system"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (4,5). There are apples at (0,5), (5,5), (3,7), (7,3), and (1,1). Oh, and there's an enemy snake number 1 at (9,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . 2 A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . A . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (4,5), which is in row 5, column 4.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (0,5): row 5, column 0\n\n- (5,5): row 5, column 5\n\n- (3,7): row 7, column 3\n\n- (7,3): row 3, column 7\n\n- (1,1): row 1, column 1\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (9,1), which is row 1, column 9.\n\nOkay, I need to think about which apple to go for. I should consider which one is closest and which one poses the least risk.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\nTo (0,5):\n\nDistance = |4-0| + |5-5| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nTo (5,5):\n\nDistance = |4-5| + |5-5| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nTo (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |5-7| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nTo (7,3):\n\nDistance = |4-7| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nTo (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5), only 1 step away.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if there are any obstacles or enemies in that direction.\n\nLooking at the board, (5,5) is right next to me, to my right.\n\nIs there any part of my snake or the enemy snake there? From the board, it's just an apple, so it should be safe to move there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. But since I'm currently just the head at (4,5), my new position would be (5,5), and my tail would be at (4,5).\n\nNow, what's next? There are still apples at (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), and (1,1).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to eat as many apples as possible without running into walls, enemies, or myself.\n\nLet's think about the positions:\n\nFrom (5,5), I can see the apple at (0,5) is directly to my left, 5 steps away.\n\nThe apple at (3,7) is up and to the left.\n\n(7,3) is down and to the right.\n\n(1,1) is down and to the left.\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake at (9,1). I should keep an eye on its movement, but since it's only the head with no body parts, it might be less threatening for now.\n\nBut in this turn, I need to decide where to go.\n\nOption 1: Go right to (5,5), eat the apple, then plan to go left towards (0,5).\n\nOption 2: Go up towards (3,7).\n\nOption 3: Go down towards (7,3) or (1,1).\n\nHmm.\n\nGoing right to (5,5) seems straightforward, as it's only one step away.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can consider moving left towards (0,5).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), moving left to (4,5) is my tail, which is now at (4,5) after I eat the apple at (5,5).\n\nWait, no. After eating the apple at (5,5), my head moves to (5,5), and my tail remains at (4,5). So, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) would be moving into my own tail, which would cause me to die.\n\nOh no, that's a problem.\n\nSo, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (5,5), because my tail is there.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail extends, so your tail remains where it was, and you grow by one segment.\n\nSo, in this case, after eating the apple at (5,5), my body would be:\n\nHead at (5,5), previous head at (4,5).\n\nSo, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) would be moving into my own body, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (5,5).\n\nSo, maybe I should consider another direction.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,5), I can move up or down.\n\nLet's see:\n\nMoving up from (5,5) to (5,6). Is there anything there? From the board, it's empty.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can continue up to (5,7), where there's an apple at (3,7), but that's not directly up.\n\nWait, (3,7) is at column 3, row 7.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving up to (5,6), then (5,7), but that's column 5, row 7.\n\nThe apple is at column 3, row 7.\n\nSo, I would need to move left from (5,7) to (4,7), then to (3,7) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (0,5), but as we saw, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) is into my own body.\n\nSo, maybe I should move right from (5,5) to (6,5).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), move right to (6,5), which is empty.\n\nThen, I can continue moving left back to (5,5), then (4,5), but wait, my tail would be moving, so I need to be careful.\n\nActually, in Snake games, each move advances the head and the tail moves to where the previous head was.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (5,5), my body is now two segments: head at (5,5), and tail at (4,5).\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), my new body would be head at (6,5), and previous head at (5,5).\n\nThen, if I move left to (5,5), I'm moving into my own body, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, no. In Snake, you can't move back to the previous position immediately, because your tail is there.\n\nBut in this case, after eating the apple, my body is head at (5,5), and tail at (4,5).\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), then my body becomes head at (6,5), and tail at (5,5).\n\nThen, if I move left to (5,5), I'm moving into my tail, which is now at (5,5).\n\nSo, that's still not allowed.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need to choose a different path.\n\nMaybe I should consider moving up from (5,5) to (5,6), then (5,7), then left to (4,7), then (3,7) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, rows 6 and 7 seem empty in column 5.\n\nSo, from (5,5), up to (5,6), then (5,7), then left to (4,7), then (3,7) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (7,3), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,5), down to (5,4), then (5,3), then right to"

Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at positions (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (5,5). There's an enemy snake, ID 1, at (8,1) with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout based on the given state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . T 2 . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: .

The 'T' might represent the tail, but since I just started, maybe it's just notation. There's an apple at (0,5), which is in the same row but column 0.\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are several factors to consider:\n\n1. **Proximity**: Which apple is closest to my current position.\n\n2. **Safety**: Ensuring I don't run into walls, enemy snakes, or myself.\n\n3. **Future Path**: Planning a path that allows me to pick up multiple apples efficiently.\n\nLet's list out the distances to each apple using Manhattan distance, which is suitable for grid movements without diagonals.\n\n- To (0,5): |5-0| + |5-5| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n- To (3,7): |5-3| + |5-7| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (7,3): |5-7| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (1,1): |5-1| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- To (2,0): |5-2| + |5-0| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (3,7) and (7,3), both with a distance of 4.\n\nBut wait, there's also an apple at (0,5) which is distance 5, and another at (5,5), which seems to be where I am now. Wait, the board shows an 'A' at (0,5) and (5,5), and 'T' and '2' at (5,5). Maybe there's confusion in notation.\n\nLooking back, the board shows:\n\nRow 5: A . . . T 2 . . . .\n\nSo, 'A' at column 0, 'T' and '2' at column 5. Probably 'T' is the tail, and '2' is my head.\n\nSo, there is an apple at (0,5) and another at (5,5), where I am now. Wait, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple there, do I automatically eat it by staying put? Probably not; I need to move to a new cell to eat the apple.\n\nHmm, maybe the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto that cell to eat it.\n\nBut if I'm already there, perhaps I need to move onto it in my next move.\n\nWait, in Snake games, you move to an adjacent cell to eat the apple.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple at (5,5), maybe I need to move onto it, which would extend my snake.\n\nBut in reality, in Snake games, the apple is on the cell you move into, and eating it makes your snake longer.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple at (5,5), moving onto (5,5) would make me eat the apple and grow.\n\nBut, if I'm already on (5,5), maybe I need to move to an adjacent cell to eat the apple.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nBut in this setup, I'm at (5,5), and the apple is also at (5,5). Maybe the board notation is confusing.\n\nLet's assume that moving onto (5,5) from my current position would make me eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple is at (0,5) and (5,5), and I'm at (5,5).\n\nIn that case, moving onto (5,5) would make me eat the apple.\n\nBut, in Snake games, you can't stay in the same place; you must move to an adjacent cell.\n\nSo, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet's look back at the board:\n\nRow 5: A . . . T 2 . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, 'A' at (0,5), 'T' at (4,5), '2' at (5,5).\n\nSo, apple at (0,5), my tail at (4,5), and head at (5,5).\n\nWait, but according to the initial information, my snake is at (5,5), and the apple is also at (5,5). There might be a mismatch in notation.\n\nTo clarify:\n\n- My snake is at (5,5).\n\n- There is an apple at (5,5).\n\n- My tail is at (4,5).\n\nSo, if I move to (5,5), I should eat the apple and grow.\n\nBut in Snake games, moving onto the apple extends the snake by one segment.\n\nTherefore, if I move onto the apple at (5,5), my snake grows, and my tail remains where it was.\n\nWait, no. When you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail stays in place, and your head moves to the new cell.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and I move to (5,5), that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nBut I'm already on (5,5). Maybe the apple is still there, and moving onto it counts as eating it.\n\nIn that case, moving to (5,5) from (5,5) doesn't make sense because I can't stay in place.\n\nSo, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nBut I'm already on (5,5), so maybe I need to move to another adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the apple is at (5,5), and moving onto it from an adjacent cell allows me to eat it.\n\nBut since I'm already on (5,5), perhaps I need to move to another cell to eat it.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple remains until I move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nI think I need to clarify the rules of this specific Snake game.\n\nAssuming that moving onto the apple from an adjacent cell causes me to eat it, and since I'm already on (5,5), maybe I need to move to (5,5) from an adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nBut that seems odd because I'm already on (5,5).\n\nMaybe the apple disappears once I'm on it, or perhaps I need to move onto it from a different direction to eat it.\n\nTo simplify, perhaps I should consider that moving onto (5,5) from an adjacent cell allows me to eat the apple.\n\nGiven that, I need to move to (5,5) from, say, (4,5), to eat the apple.\n\nBut I'm already at (5,5), so maybe I need to move to another adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should consider the apple at (5,5) as already eaten or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are two apples: one at (0,5) and one at (5,5).\n\nLooking back, the initial information says apples are at (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0).\n\nBut the board shows an 'A' at (0,5) and (5,5), and 'T' and '2' at (5,5).\n\nMaybe there's only one apple at (0,5), and I'm at (5,5) with 'T' and '2' overlapping.\n\nThis is unclear. Perhaps I should proceed with the list of apple positions:"

There are apples at positions (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (5,6).

There's an apple at (0,5), which is in the same row but column 0.\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first.

The apple at (3,7) is the closest with a distance of 3.\n\nBut I should also consider the position of the enemy snake. Enemy snake 1 is at (8,2). I need to make sure that my path to the apple doesn't lead me into the enemy's path or a position where the enemy can easily cut me off.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (8,2), and I'm at (5,6). The apple at (3,7) is in the upper left direction from my current position. The enemy is in the lower right direction. So, moving towards (3,7) might take me away from the enemy, which is good.\n\nAdditionally, there are other apples at (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). I should think about a path that allows me to pick up more than one apple efficiently. But for now, let's focus on the closest apple at (3,7).\n\nTo get from (5,6) to (3,7), I need to move up twice and right once. So, possible moves:\n\n- UP to (4,6)\n\n- UP to (3,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nBut I need to make sure that these moves are safe and don't lead me into the enemy or a dead end.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (5,6), UP to (4,6):\n\n- Is (4,6) occupied? Doesn't seem so.\n\n- From (4,6), UP to (3,6):\n\n- Is (3,6) occupied? Doesn't seem so.\n\n- From (3,6), RIGHT to (3,7):\n\n- Is (3,7) occupied? It has an apple, so it's open.\n\nSo, this path seems clear. But I should also consider if the enemy might intercept me.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,2). If it moves UP, it goes to (7,2); then to (6,2); then to (5,2); and so on. It would take several moves for the enemy to reach my path.\n\nGiven that, it seems safe to proceed to (3,7).\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (3,7), I need to think about where to go next. The next closest apple would be (7,3), which is quite a distance away. I need to plan a path that avoids the enemy and doesn't lead me into a trap.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (0,5), which is also fairly distant. But considering the positions, going to (3,7) first and then to (7,3) might be a better strategy because they are somewhat aligned horizontally.\n\nWait, (3,7) and (7,3) are diagonally opposite, so maybe not the best sequence. Let's see:\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apple is likely (7,3), with a distance of |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, going to (0,5) from (3,7) would be |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nSo, (0,5) is closer from (3,7) than (7,3).\n\nBut (0,5) is also closer to the enemy's current position at (8,2). The distance for the enemy to (0,5) is |8-0| + |2-5| = 8 + 3 = 11.\n\nGiven that, and considering that I need to get to (0,5) from (3,7), which is 5 moves, and the enemy is 11 moves away from (0,5), it might still be safe.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that the enemy might change its path or grow longer, which could make it reach (0,5) faster.\n\nTo minimize risk, perhaps I should prioritize the apples that are farther from the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (0,5): 11 moves for the enemy\n\n- (3,7): |8-3| + |2-7| = 5 + 5 = 10 moves for the enemy\n\n- (7,3): |8-7| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2 moves for the enemy\n\n- (1,1): |8-1| + |2-1| = 7 + 1 = 8 moves for the enemy\n\n- (2,0): |8-2| + |2-0| = 6 + 2 = 8 moves for the enemy\n\nSo, the apple at (7,3) is only 2 moves away for the enemy. That's dangerous.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should avoid going to (7,3) for now and focus on (0,5) and (3,7), which are farther from the enemy.\n\nGiven that, going to (3,7) first, then to (0,5), might be a better strategy.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,7), I can then head to (0,5), which is 5 moves away, while the enemy would need 11 moves to get there.\n\nBut I need to consider that as I move, the enemy might also be moving towards the same apple, adjusting its path.\n\nTo be safe, perhaps I should consider picking up the apple at (0,5) first, as it's farther from the enemy and closer to my current position.\n\nWait, but (0,5) is at the top-left corner, and I'm at (5,6). The enemy is at (8,2), which is closer to (0,5) than I am.\n\nWait, no: my distance to (0,5) is |5-0| + |6-5| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves.\n\nEnemy's distance to (0,5) is |8-0| + |2-5| = 8 + 3 = 11 moves.\n\nSo, I am closer to (0,5) than the enemy is.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should aim for (0,5) directly from my current position.\n\nLet's calculate the path:\n\nFrom (5,6) to (0,5):\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,1)\n\n- Move UP to (4,1)\n\n-"

There are multiple apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,6) to each apple:\n\n- To (0,5): |7-0| + |6-5| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n- To (3,7): |7-3| + |6-7| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- To (7,3): |7-7| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n- To (1,1): |7-1| + |6-1| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- To (2,0): |7-2| + |6-0| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3), with a distance of 3.\n\nNext closest is (3,7) at distance 5, and (0,5) at distance 8.\n\nNow, I need to consider the position of the enemy snake. The enemy is at (8,3), which is close to me.\n\nI need to plan a path to the apple at (7,3) and ensure that I don't run into the enemy.\n\nLet's visualize the path:\n\nFrom (7,6) to (7,3):\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,3)\n\nI need to check if the enemy can intercept me on this path.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,3). If it moves UP to (7,3), it would directly conflict with my path.\n\nSo, that's a potential danger.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for the apple at (3,7), which is at a distance of 5.\n\nPath from (7,6) to (3,7):\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (5,6)\n\n- Move UP to (4,6)\n\n- Move UP to (3,6)\n\n- Move RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nThis path seems longer, but it takes me away from the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,3), and if it moves towards (3,7), it would need to move UP to (7,3), then LEFT to (7,2), and so on, which would take more moves.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (3,7) is safer.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,7), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nLet's think about the next apple to go for after (3,7).\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apples would be:\n\n- (7,3): |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (0,5): |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, (0,5) is closer.\n\nBut (0,5) is also relatively far from my current position, and the enemy is closer to (0,5) than I am.\n\nWait, no, earlier I saw that I am closer to (0,5) than the enemy.\n\nWait, let's recalculate distances:\n\nMy position: (7,6)\n\nApple at (0,5): |7-0| + |6-5| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nEnemy at (8,3) to (0,5): |8-0| + |3-5| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\nSo, the enemy is farther from (0,5) than I am.\n\nTherefore, perhaps going for (0,5) directly from my current position is safer, as the enemy has to cover more distance.\n\nLet's plan a path to (0,5):\n\nFrom (7,6) to (0,5):\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (5,6)\n\n- Move UP to (4,6)\n\n- Move UP to (3,6)\n\n- Move UP to (2,6)\n\n- Move UP to (1,6)\n\n- Move UP to (0,6)\n\n- Move LEFT to (0,5)\n\nThat's 7 moves up and 1 left, totaling 8 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy would need to move to (0,5), which is 10 moves away.\n\nSo, I can reach (0,5) before the enemy does.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that the enemy doesn't change its path to intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider picking up the apple at (3,7) first, then go to (0,5).\n\nBut that would take me 5 moves to (3,7) and then 5 more moves to (0,5), totaling 10 moves, while directly going to (0,5) is 8 moves.\n\nSo, going directly to (0,5) is more efficient.\n\nAlso, after eating (0,5), I can consider going for another apple.\n\nFrom (0,5), the closest apples would be:\n\n- (1,1): |0-1| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- (2,0): |0-2| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nSo, (1,1) is closest.\n\nBut (1,1) is also close to the enemy's starting position.\n\nWait, enemy is at (8,3). Distance to (1,1):\n\n|8-1| + |3-1| = 7 + 2 = 9 moves.\n\nSo, from (0,5), I can go to (1,1) in 5 moves, while the enemy would need 9 moves to get there.\n\nThat seems safe.\n\nAfter that, the remaining apples are (3,7) and (7,3).\n\nFrom (1,1), to (3,7):\n\n|1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\nTo (7,3): |1-7| + |1-3| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, both are equidistant.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (3,7) next.\n\nBut considering the enemy's position"

I'll move LEFT as that would also bring me closer to the apple at (3,7) which is part of my next strategy once the apple at (7,3) is consumed.\n\nStrategy for Next Turn: Keep a close eye on the enemy snake's movement.

I'll go with the board state, so my position is (7,6).\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,2) with no body parts.\n\nOkay, so I need to decide my next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple to go for.

Next is (3,7) at distance 5, and (0,5) at distance 8. The others are farther.\n\nNow, I need to consider the enemy snake's position at (8,2). That's somewhat close to the apple at (7,3), as the enemy would need to move to (7,2) and then to (7,3), which is a distance of 1 + 1 = 2 moves.\n\nWait, but I need to think about the timing. If I move towards (7,3), and the enemy moves towards (7,3) as well, they might get there before me.\n\nWait, no. I'm closer to (7,3) than the enemy is. I'm at (7,6), so it's 3 moves away, and the enemy is at (8,2), which is 2 moves away to (7,2) and then one more to (7,3), totaling 3 moves as well.\n\nSo, we might reach (7,3) at the same time if we both go for it.\n\nBut I need to consider that if both snakes reach the apple at the same time, probably only one will get it, and perhaps the one that reaches first, or maybe it's undefined. To play it safe, I should consider that the enemy might get to (7,3) before me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can plan a path that allows me to get to (7,3) before the enemy.\n\nLet's think about possible paths.\n\nFrom (7,6) to (7,3):\n\n- LEFT to (7,5)\n\n- LEFT to (7,4)\n\n- LEFT to (7,3)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nEnemy from (8,2) to (7,3):\n\n- UP to (7,2)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,3)\n\nThat's 2 moves.\n\nWait, that's faster than my 3 moves. So, the enemy can get to (7,3) in 2 moves, while I need 3. That means the enemy will reach first unless I can interfere or find a different path.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider going for (3,7) instead, which is at a distance of 5.\n\nFrom (7,6) to (3,7):\n\n- UP to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (5,6)\n\n- UP to (4,6)\n\n- UP to (3,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nEnemy from (8,2) to (3,7):\n\n- UP to (7,2)\n\n- UP to (6,2)\n\n- UP to (5,2)\n\n- UP to (4,2)\n\n- UP to (3,2)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nThat's 2 moves up and then 5 moves right, totaling 7 moves.\n\nSo, in this case, I can reach (3,7) in 5 moves, and the enemy would take 7 moves, so I reach first.\n\nAfter eating (3,7), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apples are:\n\n- (0,5): |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (7,3): |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (1,1): |3-1| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- (2,0): |3-2| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nSo, (0,5) is the closest at 5 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy, after moving 7 moves to (3,7), would have to go to another apple.\n\nBut since I'm already at (3,7), and assuming I eat it, I can move to (0,5) before the enemy can get there.\n\nFrom (3,7) to (0,5):\n\n- LEFT to (3,6)\n\n- LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,2)\n\n- LEFT to (3,1)\n\n- LEFT to (3,0)\n\n- DOWN to (4,0)\n\n- DOWN to (5,0)\n\n- DOWN to (6,0)\n\n- DOWN to (7,0)\n\n- DOWN to (8,0)\n\n- DOWN to (9,0)\n\nWait, that seems inefficient.

But wait, the enemy is at (3,7) after 7 moves, and I'm already there after 5 moves.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me outline a sequence:\n\n1. Move to (3,7) via UP,UP,UP,UP,RIGHT.\n\n2. Eat the apple at (3,7).\n\n3. Move to (0,5) via UP,UP,UP,LEFT,LEFT.\n\nTotal moves: 5 + 5 = 10 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy starts at (8,2):\n\n- Moves to (7,2)\n\n- Moves to (6,2)\n\n- Moves to (5,2)\n\n- Moves to (4,2)\n\n- Moves to (3,2)\n\n- Moves to (3,3)\n\n- Moves to (3,4)\n\n- Moves to (3,5)\n\n- Moves to (3,6)\n\n- Moves to (3,7)\n\nThat's 7 moves to reach (3,7), but I've already eaten it by then.\n\nThen, the enemy would have to go for another apple.\n\nSo, perhaps this is a viable strategy.\n\nAfter eating (0,5), the closest apples are (1,1) and (2,0), both at a distance of 5 moves.\n\nFrom (0,5) to (1,1):\n\n- DOWN to (1,5)\n\n- DOWN to (2,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- DOWN to (5,5)\n\n- DOWN to (6,5)\n\n- DOWN to (7,5)\n\n- DOWN to (8,5)\n\n- RIGHT to"

My snake, ID 2, is currently at (7,8).\n\nWait, in the board state, it shows my position at (7,8), but in the text, it says (6,8). There might be a confusion here. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . T 2 . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . A . 1 . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . T . .\n\nRow 1: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, '2' is at row 8, column 7, which is (8,7). But the text says (7,8). There's a discrepancy here. I'll go with the board state, so my position is (8,7).\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,3) with body at (7,2).\n\nOkay, so I need to decide my next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (8,7) to each apple:\n\n- To (0,5): |8-0| + |7-5| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\n- To (3,7): |8-3| + |7-7| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n- To (1,1): |8-1| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- To (2,0): |8-2| + |7-0| = 6 + 7 = 13\n\n- To (7,3): |8-7| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (3,7) and (7,3), both at a distance of 5.\n\nNow, I need to consider the enemy snake's position at (7,3) with body at (7,2). If I go for the apple at (7,3), I have to pass through (7,3), but the enemy is already there. So, that might not be safe.\n\nLet's think about going for the apple at (3,7).\n\nFrom (8,7), I can move UP to (7,7), then (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7). That's 5 moves.\n\nDuring these moves, the enemy is at (7,3), and its body is at (7,2). So, the enemy is moving somewhere, but I don't know its direction yet.\n\nAssuming the enemy is moving towards me or towards an apple, I need to predict its path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the enemy is moving towards the apple at (7,3), which is adjacent to it.\n\nIf I go for (3,7), the enemy might stay put or move elsewhere, but I need to make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (7,3), but that's risky because the enemy is already there.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (7,3), and its body is at (7,2). So, it's probably moving towards me or towards another apple.\n\nI need to consider that if I move towards (7,3), I might collide with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can lure the enemy towards (7,3), eat the apple, and then move away.\n\nBut that sounds dangerous. Maybe I should avoid that.\n\nLet me consider going for the apple at (3,7). It's at (3,7), and I'm at (8,7). So, I need to move UP 5 times.\n\nDuring these moves, the enemy might move towards me or towards another apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (0,5), which is at (0,5). That's farther, but perhaps safer.\n\nLet's calculate the distance to (0,5):\n\nFrom (8,7):\n\n- DOWN to (7,7)\n\n- DOWN to (6,7)\n\n- DOWN to (5,7)\n\n- DOWN to (4,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,6)\n\n- LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,2)\n\n- LEFT to (3,1)\n\n- LEFT to (3,0)\n\n- UP to (2,0)\n\n- UP to (1,0)\n\n- UP to (0,0)\n\n- RIGHT to (0,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (0,2)\n\n- RIGHT to (0,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (0,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (0,5)\n\nThat's way too many moves. Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, perhaps a better path:\n\nFrom (8,7):\n\n- DOWN to (7,7)\n\n- DOWN to (6,7)\n\n- DOWN to (5,7)\n\n- DOWN to (4,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,7)\n\n- DOWN to (2,7)\n\n- DOWN to (1,7)\n\n- DOWN to (0,7)\n\n- LEFT to (0,6)\n\n- LEFT to (0,5)\n\nThat's 9 moves.\n\nBut that's too many moves, and the enemy can reach apples faster.\n\nMaybe I should prioritize closer apples.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (3,7) again.\n\nFrom (8,7):\n\n- DOWN to (7,7)\n\n- DOWN to (6,7)\n\n- DOWN to (5,7)\n\n- DOWN to (4,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,7)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nDuring these moves, the enemy is at (7,3), and its body is at (7,2).\n\nIf the enemy moves towards me, it would have to move UP to (6,3), then (5,3), etc., which would take more moves.\n\nAlternatively, if the enemy moves towards the apple at (3,7), it would have to move UP to (6,3), then (5,3), etc., which would still take several moves.\n\nSo, I might be able to reach (3,7) before the enemy does.\n\nAfter eating (3,7), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apples are:\n\n- (0,5): |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (7,3): |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (1,1): |3-1| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- (2,0): |3-2| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nSo, (0,5) is the closest at 5 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy would have to move from (7,3) to (3,7), which is |7-3| + |3-7| = 4 + 4 = 8 moves.\n\nSo, I can reach (0,5) after eating (3,7) before the enemy can catch up.\n\nTherefore, my plan is:\n\n1. Move to (3,7):\n\n- DOWN to (7,7)\n\n- DOWN to (6,7)\n\n- DOWN to (5,7)\n\n- DOWN to (4,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,7)\n\n2. Eat the apple at (3,7), growing longer.\n\n3. Then move to (0,5):\n\n- DOWN to (2,7)\n\n- DOWN to (1,7)\n\n- DOWN to (0,7)\n\n- LEFT to (0,6)\n\n- LEFT to (0,5)\n\nDuring these moves, the enemy would have to move towards me, but it would take more moves, so I should be safe.\n\nAfter eating (0,5), I can consider going for another apple.\n\nBut for now, focusing on (3,7) seems like a good strategy.\n\nSo, for my next move, I should move DOWN to (7,7).\n\nWait, but looking at my current position at (8,7), moving DOWN would be towards (9,7), which is off the board. So, that's invalid.\n\nWait, in this game, decreasing y-coordinate is down, and increasing y-coordinate is up.\n\nSo, from (8,7), moving DOWN would be to (7,7), not (9,7). Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the coordinate system"

LEFT to (7,3)\n\nBut wait, there's an enemy body at (7,3), so that's blocked. I can't go directly to (3,7) via (7,3).\n\nAlternatively, I can go UP to (6,7), then LEFT to (6,6), (6,5), (6,4), and then DOWN to (5,4), etc. This might be longer, but safer.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider going for a different apple that's closer and without obstacles.\n\nLooking at the apple at (5,3), which is at a distance of 6.\n\nPath to (5,3):\n\nFrom (7,7):\n\n1.

There are apples at (0,5), (5,5), (3,7), (7,3), and (1,1). Oh, and there's an enemy snake number 1 at (9,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . 2 A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . A . . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, I'm at (4,5), which is in row 5, column 4.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (0,5): row 5, column 0\n\n- (5,5): row 5, column 5\n\n- (3,7): row 7, column 3\n\n- (7,3): row 3, column 7\n\n- (1,1): row 1, column 1\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (9,1), which is row 1, column 9.\n\nOkay, I need to think about which apple to go for. I should consider which one is closest and which one poses the least risk.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\nTo (0,5):\n\nDistance = |4-0| + |5-5| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\nTo (5,5):\n\nDistance = |4-5| + |5-5| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\nTo (3,7):\n\nDistance = |4-3| + |5-7| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nTo (7,3):\n\nDistance = |4-7| + |5-3| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nTo (1,1):\n\nDistance = |4-1| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (5,5), only 1 step away.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if there are any obstacles or enemies in that direction.\n\nLooking at the board, (5,5) is right next to me, to my right.\n\nIs there any part of my snake or the enemy snake there? From the board, it's just an apple, so it should be safe to move there.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so my tail would extend. But since I'm currently just the head at (4,5), my new position would be (5,5), and my tail would be at (4,5).\n\nNow, what's next? There are still apples at (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), and (1,1).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to eat as many apples as possible without running into walls, enemies, or myself.\n\nLet's think about the positions:\n\nFrom (5,5), I can see the apple at (0,5) is directly to my left, 5 steps away.\n\nThe apple at (3,7) is up and to the left.\n\n(7,3) is down and to the right.\n\n(1,1) is down and to the left.\n\nI need to consider the enemy snake at (9,1). I should keep an eye on its movement, but since it's only the head with no body parts, it might be less threatening for now.\n\nBut in this turn, I need to decide where to go.\n\nOption 1: Go right to (5,5), eat the apple, then plan to go left towards (0,5).\n\nOption 2: Go up towards (3,7).\n\nOption 3: Go down towards (7,3) or (1,1).\n\nHmm.\n\nGoing right to (5,5) seems straightforward, as it's only one step away.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I can consider moving left towards (0,5).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe.\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), moving left to (4,5) is my tail, which is now at (4,5) after I eat the apple at (5,5).\n\nWait, no. After eating the apple at (5,5), my head moves to (5,5), and my tail remains at (4,5). So, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) would be moving into my own tail, which would cause me to die.\n\nOh no, that's a problem.\n\nSo, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (5,5), because my tail is there.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, when you eat an apple, your tail extends, so your tail remains where it was, and you grow by one segment.\n\nSo, in this case, after eating the apple at (5,5), my body would be:\n\nHead at (5,5), previous head at (4,5).\n\nSo, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) would be moving into my own body, which is not allowed.\n\nTherefore, I can't move left immediately after eating the apple at (5,5).\n\nSo, maybe I should consider another direction.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,5), I can move up or down.\n\nLet's see:\n\nMoving up from (5,5) to (5,6). Is there anything there? From the board, it's empty.\n\nThen from (5,6), I can continue up to (5,7), where there's an apple at (3,7), but that's not directly up.\n\nWait, (3,7) is at column 3, row 7.\n\nFrom (5,5), moving up to (5,6), then (5,7), but that's column 5, row 7.\n\nThe apple is at column 3, row 7.\n\nSo, I would need to move left from (5,7) to (4,7), then to (3,7) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (0,5), but as we saw, moving left from (5,5) to (4,5) is into my own body.\n\nSo, maybe I should move right from (5,5) to (6,5).\n\nLet's see:\n\nFrom (5,5), move right to (6,5), which is empty.\n\nThen, I can continue moving left back to (5,5), then (4,5), but wait, my tail would be moving, so I need to be careful.\n\nActually, in Snake games, each move advances the head and the tail moves to where the previous head was.\n\nSo, after eating the apple at (5,5), my body is now two segments: head at (5,5), and tail at (4,5).\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), my new body would be head at (6,5), and previous head at (5,5).\n\nThen, if I move left to (5,5), I'm moving into my own body, which is not allowed.\n\nWait, no. In Snake, you can't move back to the previous position immediately, because your tail is there.\n\nBut in this case, after eating the apple, my body is head at (5,5), and tail at (4,5).\n\nIf I move right to (6,5), then my body becomes head at (6,5), and tail at (5,5).\n\nThen, if I move left to (5,5), I'm moving into my tail, which is now at (5,5).\n\nSo, that's still not allowed.\n\nHmm, so perhaps I need to choose a different path.\n\nMaybe I should consider moving up from (5,5) to (5,6), then (5,7), then left to (4,7), then (3,7) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLooking at the board, rows 6 and 7 seem empty in column 5.\n\nSo, from (5,5), up to (5,6), then (5,7), then left to (4,7), then (3,7) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating that apple, I would grow, so I need to plan accordingly.\n\nBut this seems a bit convoluted. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (7,3), which is down and to the right.\n\nFrom (5,5), down to (5,4), then (5,3), then right to"

Let's see the current situation.\n\nSo, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at positions (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (5,5). There's an enemy snake, ID 1, at (8,1) with no body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout based on the given state:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . T 2 . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: .

The 'T' might represent the tail, but since I just started, maybe it's just notation. There's an apple at (0,5), which is in the same row but column 0.\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are several factors to consider:\n\n1. **Proximity**: Which apple is closest to my current position.\n\n2. **Safety**: Ensuring I don't run into walls, enemy snakes, or myself.\n\n3. **Future Path**: Planning a path that allows me to pick up multiple apples efficiently.\n\nLet's list out the distances to each apple using Manhattan distance, which is suitable for grid movements without diagonals.\n\n- To (0,5): |5-0| + |5-5| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n- To (3,7): |5-3| + |5-7| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (7,3): |5-7| + |5-3| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (1,1): |5-1| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- To (2,0): |5-2| + |5-0| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (3,7) and (7,3), both with a distance of 4.\n\nBut wait, there's also an apple at (0,5) which is distance 5, and another at (5,5), which seems to be where I am now. Wait, the board shows an 'A' at (0,5) and (5,5), and 'T' and '2' at (5,5). Maybe there's confusion in notation.\n\nLooking back, the board shows:\n\nRow 5: A . . . T 2 . . . .\n\nSo, 'A' at column 0, 'T' and '2' at column 5. Probably 'T' is the tail, and '2' is my head.\n\nSo, there is an apple at (0,5) and another at (5,5), where I am now. Wait, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple there, do I automatically eat it by staying put? Probably not; I need to move to a new cell to eat the apple.\n\nHmm, maybe the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto that cell to eat it.\n\nBut if I'm already there, perhaps I need to move onto it in my next move.\n\nWait, in Snake games, you move to an adjacent cell to eat the apple.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple at (5,5), maybe I need to move onto it, which would extend my snake.\n\nBut in reality, in Snake games, the apple is on the cell you move into, and eating it makes your snake longer.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and there's an apple at (5,5), moving onto (5,5) would make me eat the apple and grow.\n\nBut, if I'm already on (5,5), maybe I need to move to an adjacent cell to eat the apple.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nBut in this setup, I'm at (5,5), and the apple is also at (5,5). Maybe the board notation is confusing.\n\nLet's assume that moving onto (5,5) from my current position would make me eat the apple.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the apple is at (0,5) and (5,5), and I'm at (5,5).\n\nIn that case, moving onto (5,5) would make me eat the apple.\n\nBut, in Snake games, you can't stay in the same place; you must move to an adjacent cell.\n\nSo, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet's look back at the board:\n\nRow 5: A . . . T 2 . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, 'A' at (0,5), 'T' at (4,5), '2' at (5,5).\n\nSo, apple at (0,5), my tail at (4,5), and head at (5,5).\n\nWait, but according to the initial information, my snake is at (5,5), and the apple is also at (5,5). There might be a mismatch in notation.\n\nTo clarify:\n\n- My snake is at (5,5).\n\n- There is an apple at (5,5).\n\n- My tail is at (4,5).\n\nSo, if I move to (5,5), I should eat the apple and grow.\n\nBut in Snake games, moving onto the apple extends the snake by one segment.\n\nTherefore, if I move onto the apple at (5,5), my snake grows, and my tail remains where it was.\n\nWait, no. When you eat an apple, your snake grows, so the tail stays in place, and your head moves to the new cell.\n\nSo, if I'm at (5,5), and I move to (5,5), that doesn't make sense.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nBut I'm already on (5,5). Maybe the apple is still there, and moving onto it counts as eating it.\n\nIn that case, moving to (5,5) from (5,5) doesn't make sense because I can't stay in place.\n\nSo, perhaps the apple is at (5,5), and I need to move onto it from an adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nBut I'm already on (5,5), so maybe I need to move to another adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nThis is confusing. Maybe I need to consider that the apple is at (5,5), and moving onto it from an adjacent cell allows me to eat it.\n\nBut since I'm already on (5,5), perhaps I need to move to another cell to eat it.\n\nWait, perhaps the apple remains until I move onto it from an adjacent cell.\n\nI think I need to clarify the rules of this specific Snake game.\n\nAssuming that moving onto the apple from an adjacent cell causes me to eat it, and since I'm already on (5,5), maybe I need to move to (5,5) from an adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nBut that seems odd because I'm already on (5,5).\n\nMaybe the apple disappears once I'm on it, or perhaps I need to move onto it from a different direction to eat it.\n\nTo simplify, perhaps I should consider that moving onto (5,5) from an adjacent cell allows me to eat the apple.\n\nGiven that, I need to move to (5,5) from, say, (4,5), to eat the apple.\n\nBut I'm already at (5,5), so maybe I need to move to another adjacent cell to eat it.\n\nThis is getting too confusing. Maybe I should consider the apple at (5,5) as already eaten or something.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there are two apples: one at (0,5) and one at (5,5).\n\nLooking back, the initial information says apples are at (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0).\n\nBut the board shows an 'A' at (0,5) and (5,5), and 'T' and '2' at (5,5).\n\nMaybe there's only one apple at (0,5), and I'm at (5,5) with 'T' and '2' overlapping.\n\nThis is unclear. Perhaps I should proceed with the list of apple positions:"

There are apples at positions (0,5), (3,7), (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). My snake, ID 2, is currently at (5,6).

There's an apple at (0,5), which is in the same row but column 0.\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first.

The apple at (3,7) is the closest with a distance of 3.\n\nBut I should also consider the position of the enemy snake. Enemy snake 1 is at (8,2). I need to make sure that my path to the apple doesn't lead me into the enemy's path or a position where the enemy can easily cut me off.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (8,2), and I'm at (5,6). The apple at (3,7) is in the upper left direction from my current position. The enemy is in the lower right direction. So, moving towards (3,7) might take me away from the enemy, which is good.\n\nAdditionally, there are other apples at (7,3), (1,1), and (2,0). I should think about a path that allows me to pick up more than one apple efficiently. But for now, let's focus on the closest apple at (3,7).\n\nTo get from (5,6) to (3,7), I need to move up twice and right once. So, possible moves:\n\n- UP to (4,6)\n\n- UP to (3,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nBut I need to make sure that these moves are safe and don't lead me into the enemy or a dead end.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nFrom (5,6), UP to (4,6):\n\n- Is (4,6) occupied? Doesn't seem so.\n\n- From (4,6), UP to (3,6):\n\n- Is (3,6) occupied? Doesn't seem so.\n\n- From (3,6), RIGHT to (3,7):\n\n- Is (3,7) occupied? It has an apple, so it's open.\n\nSo, this path seems clear. But I should also consider if the enemy might intercept me.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,2). If it moves UP, it goes to (7,2); then to (6,2); then to (5,2); and so on. It would take several moves for the enemy to reach my path.\n\nGiven that, it seems safe to proceed to (3,7).\n\nHowever, after eating the apple at (3,7), I need to think about where to go next. The next closest apple would be (7,3), which is quite a distance away. I need to plan a path that avoids the enemy and doesn't lead me into a trap.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (0,5), which is also fairly distant. But considering the positions, going to (3,7) first and then to (7,3) might be a better strategy because they are somewhat aligned horizontally.\n\nWait, (3,7) and (7,3) are diagonally opposite, so maybe not the best sequence. Let's see:\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apple is likely (7,3), with a distance of |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, going to (0,5) from (3,7) would be |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5.\n\nSo, (0,5) is closer from (3,7) than (7,3).\n\nBut (0,5) is also closer to the enemy's current position at (8,2). The distance for the enemy to (0,5) is |8-0| + |2-5| = 8 + 3 = 11.\n\nGiven that, and considering that I need to get to (0,5) from (3,7), which is 5 moves, and the enemy is 11 moves away from (0,5), it might still be safe.\n\nHowever, I need to consider that the enemy might change its path or grow longer, which could make it reach (0,5) faster.\n\nTo minimize risk, perhaps I should prioritize the apples that are farther from the enemy.\n\nLooking at the apples:\n\n- (0,5): 11 moves for the enemy\n\n- (3,7): |8-3| + |2-7| = 5 + 5 = 10 moves for the enemy\n\n- (7,3): |8-7| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2 moves for the enemy\n\n- (1,1): |8-1| + |2-1| = 7 + 1 = 8 moves for the enemy\n\n- (2,0): |8-2| + |2-0| = 6 + 2 = 8 moves for the enemy\n\nSo, the apple at (7,3) is only 2 moves away for the enemy. That's dangerous.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should avoid going to (7,3) for now and focus on (0,5) and (3,7), which are farther from the enemy.\n\nGiven that, going to (3,7) first, then to (0,5), might be a better strategy.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,7), I can then head to (0,5), which is 5 moves away, while the enemy would need 11 moves to get there.\n\nBut I need to consider that as I move, the enemy might also be moving towards the same apple, adjusting its path.\n\nTo be safe, perhaps I should consider picking up the apple at (0,5) first, as it's farther from the enemy and closer to my current position.\n\nWait, but (0,5) is at the top-left corner, and I'm at (5,6). The enemy is at (8,2), which is closer to (0,5) than I am.\n\nWait, no: my distance to (0,5) is |5-0| + |6-5| = 5 + 1 = 6 moves.\n\nEnemy's distance to (0,5) is |8-0| + |2-5| = 8 + 3 = 11 moves.\n\nSo, I am closer to (0,5) than the enemy is.\n\nTherefore, perhaps I should aim for (0,5) directly from my current position.\n\nLet's calculate the path:\n\nFrom (5,6) to (0,5):\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,3)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,2)\n\n- Move LEFT to (5,1)\n\n- Move UP to (4,1)\n\n-"

There are multiple apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (7,6) to each apple:\n\n- To (0,5): |7-0| + |6-5| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n- To (3,7): |7-3| + |6-7| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\n- To (7,3): |7-7| + |6-3| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n- To (1,1): |7-1| + |6-1| = 6 + 5 = 11\n\n- To (2,0): |7-2| + |6-0| = 5 + 6 = 11\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,3), with a distance of 3.\n\nNext closest is (3,7) at distance 5, and (0,5) at distance 8.\n\nNow, I need to consider the position of the enemy snake. The enemy is at (8,3), which is close to me.\n\nI need to plan a path to the apple at (7,3) and ensure that I don't run into the enemy.\n\nLet's visualize the path:\n\nFrom (7,6) to (7,3):\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,5)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,4)\n\n- Move LEFT to (7,3)\n\nI need to check if the enemy can intercept me on this path.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,3). If it moves UP to (7,3), it would directly conflict with my path.\n\nSo, that's a potential danger.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for the apple at (3,7), which is at a distance of 5.\n\nPath from (7,6) to (3,7):\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (5,6)\n\n- Move UP to (4,6)\n\n- Move UP to (3,6)\n\n- Move RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nThis path seems longer, but it takes me away from the enemy.\n\nThe enemy is at (8,3), and if it moves towards (3,7), it would need to move UP to (7,3), then LEFT to (7,2), and so on, which would take more moves.\n\nSo, perhaps going for (3,7) is safer.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,7), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nLet's think about the next apple to go for after (3,7).\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apples would be:\n\n- (7,3): |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (0,5): |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\nSo, (0,5) is closer.\n\nBut (0,5) is also relatively far from my current position, and the enemy is closer to (0,5) than I am.\n\nWait, no, earlier I saw that I am closer to (0,5) than the enemy.\n\nWait, let's recalculate distances:\n\nMy position: (7,6)\n\nApple at (0,5): |7-0| + |6-5| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\nEnemy at (8,3) to (0,5): |8-0| + |3-5| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\nSo, the enemy is farther from (0,5) than I am.\n\nTherefore, perhaps going for (0,5) directly from my current position is safer, as the enemy has to cover more distance.\n\nLet's plan a path to (0,5):\n\nFrom (7,6) to (0,5):\n\n- Move UP to (6,6)\n\n- Move UP to (5,6)\n\n- Move UP to (4,6)\n\n- Move UP to (3,6)\n\n- Move UP to (2,6)\n\n- Move UP to (1,6)\n\n- Move UP to (0,6)\n\n- Move LEFT to (0,5)\n\nThat's 7 moves up and 1 left, totaling 8 moves, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy would need to move to (0,5), which is 10 moves away.\n\nSo, I can reach (0,5) before the enemy does.\n\nHowever, I need to ensure that the enemy doesn't change its path to intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider picking up the apple at (3,7) first, then go to (0,5).\n\nBut that would take me 5 moves to (3,7) and then 5 more moves to (0,5), totaling 10 moves, while directly going to (0,5) is 8 moves.\n\nSo, going directly to (0,5) is more efficient.\n\nAlso, after eating (0,5), I can consider going for another apple.\n\nFrom (0,5), the closest apples would be:\n\n- (1,1): |0-1| + |5-1| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- (2,0): |0-2| + |5-0| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nSo, (1,1) is closest.\n\nBut (1,1) is also close to the enemy's starting position.\n\nWait, enemy is at (8,3). Distance to (1,1):\n\n|8-1| + |3-1| = 7 + 2 = 9 moves.\n\nSo, from (0,5), I can go to (1,1) in 5 moves, while the enemy would need 9 moves to get there.\n\nThat seems safe.\n\nAfter that, the remaining apples are (3,7) and (7,3).\n\nFrom (1,1), to (3,7):\n\n|1-3| + |1-7| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\nTo (7,3): |1-7| + |1-3| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\nSo, both are equidistant.\n\nPerhaps I should go for (3,7) next.\n\nBut considering the enemy's position"

I'll move LEFT as that would also bring me closer to the apple at (3,7) which is part of my next strategy once the apple at (7,3) is consumed.\n\nStrategy for Next Turn: Keep a close eye on the enemy snake's movement.

I'll go with the board state, so my position is (7,6).\n\nEnemy snake is at (8,2) with no body parts.\n\nOkay, so I need to decide my next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple to go for.

Next is (3,7) at distance 5, and (0,5) at distance 8. The others are farther.\n\nNow, I need to consider the enemy snake's position at (8,2). That's somewhat close to the apple at (7,3), as the enemy would need to move to (7,2) and then to (7,3), which is a distance of 1 + 1 = 2 moves.\n\nWait, but I need to think about the timing. If I move towards (7,3), and the enemy moves towards (7,3) as well, they might get there before me.\n\nWait, no. I'm closer to (7,3) than the enemy is. I'm at (7,6), so it's 3 moves away, and the enemy is at (8,2), which is 2 moves away to (7,2) and then one more to (7,3), totaling 3 moves as well.\n\nSo, we might reach (7,3) at the same time if we both go for it.\n\nBut I need to consider that if both snakes reach the apple at the same time, probably only one will get it, and perhaps the one that reaches first, or maybe it's undefined. To play it safe, I should consider that the enemy might get to (7,3) before me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can plan a path that allows me to get to (7,3) before the enemy.\n\nLet's think about possible paths.\n\nFrom (7,6) to (7,3):\n\n- LEFT to (7,5)\n\n- LEFT to (7,4)\n\n- LEFT to (7,3)\n\nThat's 3 moves.\n\nEnemy from (8,2) to (7,3):\n\n- UP to (7,2)\n\n- RIGHT to (7,3)\n\nThat's 2 moves.\n\nWait, that's faster than my 3 moves. So, the enemy can get to (7,3) in 2 moves, while I need 3. That means the enemy will reach first unless I can interfere or find a different path.\n\nHmm, maybe I should consider going for (3,7) instead, which is at a distance of 5.\n\nFrom (7,6) to (3,7):\n\n- UP to (6,6)\n\n- UP to (5,6)\n\n- UP to (4,6)\n\n- UP to (3,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nEnemy from (8,2) to (3,7):\n\n- UP to (7,2)\n\n- UP to (6,2)\n\n- UP to (5,2)\n\n- UP to (4,2)\n\n- UP to (3,2)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,5)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,6)\n\n- RIGHT to (3,7)\n\nThat's 2 moves up and then 5 moves right, totaling 7 moves.\n\nSo, in this case, I can reach (3,7) in 5 moves, and the enemy would take 7 moves, so I reach first.\n\nAfter eating (3,7), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apples are:\n\n- (0,5): |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (7,3): |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (1,1): |3-1| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- (2,0): |3-2| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nSo, (0,5) is the closest at 5 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy, after moving 7 moves to (3,7), would have to go to another apple.\n\nBut since I'm already at (3,7), and assuming I eat it, I can move to (0,5) before the enemy can get there.\n\nFrom (3,7) to (0,5):\n\n- LEFT to (3,6)\n\n- LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,2)\n\n- LEFT to (3,1)\n\n- LEFT to (3,0)\n\n- DOWN to (4,0)\n\n- DOWN to (5,0)\n\n- DOWN to (6,0)\n\n- DOWN to (7,0)\n\n- DOWN to (8,0)\n\n- DOWN to (9,0)\n\nWait, that seems inefficient.

But wait, the enemy is at (3,7) after 7 moves, and I'm already there after 5 moves.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to think differently.\n\nLet me outline a sequence:\n\n1. Move to (3,7) via UP,UP,UP,UP,RIGHT.\n\n2. Eat the apple at (3,7).\n\n3. Move to (0,5) via UP,UP,UP,LEFT,LEFT.\n\nTotal moves: 5 + 5 = 10 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy starts at (8,2):\n\n- Moves to (7,2)\n\n- Moves to (6,2)\n\n- Moves to (5,2)\n\n- Moves to (4,2)\n\n- Moves to (3,2)\n\n- Moves to (3,3)\n\n- Moves to (3,4)\n\n- Moves to (3,5)\n\n- Moves to (3,6)\n\n- Moves to (3,7)\n\nThat's 7 moves to reach (3,7), but I've already eaten it by then.\n\nThen, the enemy would have to go for another apple.\n\nSo, perhaps this is a viable strategy.\n\nAfter eating (0,5), the closest apples are (1,1) and (2,0), both at a distance of 5 moves.\n\nFrom (0,5) to (1,1):\n\n- DOWN to (1,5)\n\n- DOWN to (2,5)\n\n- DOWN to (3,5)\n\n- DOWN to (4,5)\n\n- DOWN to (5,5)\n\n- DOWN to (6,5)\n\n- DOWN to (7,5)\n\n- DOWN to (8,5)\n\n- RIGHT to"

My snake, ID 2, is currently at (7,8).\n\nWait, in the board state, it shows my position at (7,8), but in the text, it says (6,8). There might be a confusion here. Looking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . T 2 . .\n\nRow 7: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . . A . 1 . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . T . .\n\nRow 1: . A . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, '2' is at row 8, column 7, which is (8,7). But the text says (7,8). There's a discrepancy here. I'll go with the board state, so my position is (8,7).\n\nEnemy snake is at (7,3) with body at (7,2).\n\nOkay, so I need to decide my next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple to go for. There are multiple apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (8,7) to each apple:\n\n- To (0,5): |8-0| + |7-5| = 8 + 2 = 10\n\n- To (3,7): |8-3| + |7-7| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n- To (1,1): |8-1| + |7-1| = 7 + 6 = 13\n\n- To (2,0): |8-2| + |7-0| = 6 + 7 = 13\n\n- To (7,3): |8-7| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (3,7) and (7,3), both at a distance of 5.\n\nNow, I need to consider the enemy snake's position at (7,3) with body at (7,2). If I go for the apple at (7,3), I have to pass through (7,3), but the enemy is already there. So, that might not be safe.\n\nLet's think about going for the apple at (3,7).\n\nFrom (8,7), I can move UP to (7,7), then (6,7), (5,7), (4,7), (3,7). That's 5 moves.\n\nDuring these moves, the enemy is at (7,3), and its body is at (7,2). So, the enemy is moving somewhere, but I don't know its direction yet.\n\nAssuming the enemy is moving towards me or towards an apple, I need to predict its path.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider that the enemy is moving towards the apple at (7,3), which is adjacent to it.\n\nIf I go for (3,7), the enemy might stay put or move elsewhere, but I need to make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (7,3), but that's risky because the enemy is already there.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (7,3), and its body is at (7,2). So, it's probably moving towards me or towards another apple.\n\nI need to consider that if I move towards (7,3), I might collide with the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can lure the enemy towards (7,3), eat the apple, and then move away.\n\nBut that sounds dangerous. Maybe I should avoid that.\n\nLet me consider going for the apple at (3,7). It's at (3,7), and I'm at (8,7). So, I need to move UP 5 times.\n\nDuring these moves, the enemy might move towards me or towards another apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (0,5), which is at (0,5). That's farther, but perhaps safer.\n\nLet's calculate the distance to (0,5):\n\nFrom (8,7):\n\n- DOWN to (7,7)\n\n- DOWN to (6,7)\n\n- DOWN to (5,7)\n\n- DOWN to (4,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,7)\n\n- LEFT to (3,6)\n\n- LEFT to (3,5)\n\n- LEFT to (3,4)\n\n- LEFT to (3,3)\n\n- LEFT to (3,2)\n\n- LEFT to (3,1)\n\n- LEFT to (3,0)\n\n- UP to (2,0)\n\n- UP to (1,0)\n\n- UP to (0,0)\n\n- RIGHT to (0,1)\n\n- RIGHT to (0,2)\n\n- RIGHT to (0,3)\n\n- RIGHT to (0,4)\n\n- RIGHT to (0,5)\n\nThat's way too many moves. Maybe I miscalculated.\n\nWait, perhaps a better path:\n\nFrom (8,7):\n\n- DOWN to (7,7)\n\n- DOWN to (6,7)\n\n- DOWN to (5,7)\n\n- DOWN to (4,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,7)\n\n- DOWN to (2,7)\n\n- DOWN to (1,7)\n\n- DOWN to (0,7)\n\n- LEFT to (0,6)\n\n- LEFT to (0,5)\n\nThat's 9 moves.\n\nBut that's too many moves, and the enemy can reach apples faster.\n\nMaybe I should prioritize closer apples.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (3,7) again.\n\nFrom (8,7):\n\n- DOWN to (7,7)\n\n- DOWN to (6,7)\n\n- DOWN to (5,7)\n\n- DOWN to (4,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,7)\n\nThat's 5 moves.\n\nDuring these moves, the enemy is at (7,3), and its body is at (7,2).\n\nIf the enemy moves towards me, it would have to move UP to (6,3), then (5,3), etc., which would take more moves.\n\nAlternatively, if the enemy moves towards the apple at (3,7), it would have to move UP to (6,3), then (5,3), etc., which would still take several moves.\n\nSo, I might be able to reach (3,7) before the enemy does.\n\nAfter eating (3,7), I can consider moving to another apple.\n\nFrom (3,7), the closest apples are:\n\n- (0,5): |3-0| + |7-5| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\n- (7,3): |3-7| + |7-3| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (1,1): |3-1| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- (2,0): |3-2| + |7-0| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\nSo, (0,5) is the closest at 5 moves.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy would have to move from (7,3) to (3,7), which is |7-3| + |3-7| = 4 + 4 = 8 moves.\n\nSo, I can reach (0,5) after eating (3,7) before the enemy can catch up.\n\nTherefore, my plan is:\n\n1. Move to (3,7):\n\n- DOWN to (7,7)\n\n- DOWN to (6,7)\n\n- DOWN to (5,7)\n\n- DOWN to (4,7)\n\n- DOWN to (3,7)\n\n2. Eat the apple at (3,7), growing longer.\n\n3. Then move to (0,5):\n\n- DOWN to (2,7)\n\n- DOWN to (1,7)\n\n- DOWN to (0,7)\n\n- LEFT to (0,6)\n\n- LEFT to (0,5)\n\nDuring these moves, the enemy would have to move towards me, but it would take more moves, so I should be safe.\n\nAfter eating (0,5), I can consider going for another apple.\n\nBut for now, focusing on (3,7) seems like a good strategy.\n\nSo, for my next move, I should move DOWN to (7,7).\n\nWait, but looking at my current position at (8,7), moving DOWN would be towards (9,7), which is off the board. So, that's invalid.\n\nWait, in this game, decreasing y-coordinate is down, and increasing y-coordinate is up.\n\nSo, from (8,7), moving DOWN would be to (7,7), not (9,7). Wait, perhaps I need to clarify the coordinate system"
