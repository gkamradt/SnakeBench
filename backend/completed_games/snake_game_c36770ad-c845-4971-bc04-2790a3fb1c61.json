Avoid immediate collision with enemy snake\n2. Move towards apples strategically\n3. Keep options open for future moves\n\nThinking out loud:\n- The enemy snake is directly below me\n- I want to avoid getting trapped or cornered\n- Moving LEFT or RIGHT would give me more flexibility\n\nDecision rationale:\n- RIGHT move (3, 9) provides more open space\n- Keeps distance from enemy snake\n- Doesn't block my own potential movement paths\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

Since I'm currently at (2, 8), I can move up (direction: UP), down (direction: DOWN), left (direction: LEFT), or right (direction: RIGHT).\n\nTo avoid colliding with the walls, I can't move up (since I'm at the top edge of the board), left (since I'm at the left edge of the board), or right (since I'm close to the right edge of the board).\n\nTo avoid colliding with other snakes, I can't move towards the position of snake #1, which is (2, 9).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples. There are 5 apples at (5, 6), (3, 4), (6, 0), (1, 0), and (8, 1). Moving down (direction: DOWN) would bring me closer to the apple at (6, 0), but it's risky because I'm already close to the edge of the board. Moving left (direction: LEFT) would bring me closer to the apple at (1, 0), but it's not a good idea because I'm already at the left edge of the board. Moving right (direction: RIGHT) would bring me closer to the apple at (8, 1), but it's also risky because I'm close to the right edge of the board.\n\nMoving up (direction: UP) would bring me closer to the apples at (5, 6) and (3, 4), and it's safer because I'm not close to any edges. However, it's further from the apple at (8, 1).\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to move towards the apples that are further away from the edges of the board to minimize the risk of colliding with the walls.\n\nNext move: UP"
