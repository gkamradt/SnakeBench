However, I also need to consider the position of the enemy snake, which is at (3, 5), right next to me.\n\nIf I move up, I might be able to reach the apple at (7, 6), but I would also be moving closer to the enemy snake. Moving down or left would put me in a more vulnerable position.\n\nGiven the current state of the board, I think my best move would be to go RIGHT. This will allow me to create some distance between myself and the enemy snake, while still keeping me close to the apples on the board. Going right also opens up more potential options for my next move.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to continue moving right, and then assess the board state again to determine the best next move, whether that's up, down, or left.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
