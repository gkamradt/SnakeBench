Our snake is currently at (3, 9), which is adjacent to an apple. The enemy snake is at (5, 6) with no body parts listed, so it's not an immediate threat to us.\n\nThe closest apple to us is at (2, 2), but moving towards it would put us in a position where we have fewer options to escape if the enemy snake moves towards us. The apples at (1, 3) and (2, 3) are also close, but they are in a more open area, giving us more room to maneuver.\n\nGiven that we are at (3, 9), the most immediate move would be to collect the apple at (7, 9) by moving RIGHT. This is a straight path to an apple, and it doesn't put us in immediate danger. After collecting this apple, we will have to reassess the board to decide our next move.\n\nIt's also worth noting that moving right will put us in a position to potentially collect the apple at (1, 7) in the future, as we will be aligned with it vertically. This could set us up for a strategic move to collect that apple after we've secured the one to our right.\n\nSo, the next move is: RIGHT.\n\nFor the strategy next turn, we should consider the enemy snake's potential movements and the distribution of the remaining apples.
