Continuing in these directions might delay scoring and could potentially trap the snake later on the board.\n  \n- **Moving DOWN:** There's no apple at (7, 6), making this move less advantageous. Additionally, moving downward doesn't bring the snake closer to other available apples in the near future.\n\n- **Moving LEFT:** This move allows the snake to collect an immediate apple at (6, 7), increasing the score by 1 point. Collecting this apple not only boosts the score but also extends the snake's length, providing more flexibility in future moves. Moreover, this path keeps the snake away from the enemy snake at (4, 7), ensuring safety.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nAfter collecting the apple at (6, 7), the snake should aim to move towards the next closest apple at (5, 7). Maintaining a path that avoids the enemy snake and staying within the board boundaries will be crucial. Additionally, monitoring the positions of enemy snakes will help in planning safe routes to subsequent apples.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** **LEFT**"
