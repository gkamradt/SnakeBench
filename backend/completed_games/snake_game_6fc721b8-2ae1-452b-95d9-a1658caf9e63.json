Given the current positions of the apples and the enemy snake, we should prioritize collecting the apples that are closest to us and also consider the future path to avoid getting trapped or running into the enemy snake.\n\nStarting from our current position at (3, 9), we have the following options:\n\n1. Move to (3, 8) to collect the apple at that position. This is a direct move upwards and aligns with the general rule of collecting the nearest apple.\n2. Move to (2, 9) to position ourselves to collect the apple at (2, 0) on the next turn. However, this would put us in a position to potentially run into the enemy snake if it moves upwards on its next turn.\n3. Move to (4, 9) to position ourselves to collect the apple at (6, 0) in the future, but this would not be an immediate gain and could also put us at risk if the enemy snake moves towards us.\n\nGiven these options, the best immediate move is to collect the apple directly above us, which is also the closest apple. This will give us an immediate point and extend our snake's length, which could be beneficial for future moves.\n\nTherefore, the next move is: UP\n\nFor the next turn, we should reassess the board state and plan our move accordingly, keeping in mind the positions of the remaining apples and the enemy snake. It would be wise to avoid moving towards the enemy snake unless absolutely necessary and to keep an eye on potential paths to collect multiple apples in succession without backtracking."
