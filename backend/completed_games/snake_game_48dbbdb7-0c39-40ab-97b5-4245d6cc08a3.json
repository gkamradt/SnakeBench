Let me confirm: coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. So (0,9) is indeed the top-left.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: 2 (me) and some dots.\n\nRow 8: All dots.\n\nRow 7: All dots.\n\nRow 6: All dots.\n\nRow 5: An apple at (5,5).\n\nRow 4: An apple at (9,4).\n\nRow 3: All dots.\n\nRow 2: An apple at (0,2).\n\nRow 1: Apples at (8,1) and (7,1).\n\nRow 0: An apple at (4,0) and snake 1 at (4,0).\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,0), which is also where there's an apple. Does that mean snake 1 is on top of the apple, or is the apple still there? The board shows a '1' and an 'A' at (4,0), but maybe the '1' is the snake and 'A' is the apple. Hmm, that might be confusing.\n\nAlso, snake 1 has an empty body list, so it's just the head at (4,0). Me too, since I don't see any body parts listed for me.\n\nSo, my position: (0,9)\n\nApples at: (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), (7,1)\n\nEnemy snake at: (4,0)\n\nI need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential risks.\n\nLet me calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (0,9):\n\n1. (0,2): Distance is |0-0| + |9-2| = 0 + 7 = 7 steps.\n\n2. (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\n3. (8,1): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16 steps.\n\n4. (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\n5. (7,1): |0-7| + |9-1| = 7 + 8 = 15 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (0,2), 7 steps away.\n\nBut I should also consider the path to each apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet's visualize the grid:\n\nColumns 0 to 9, rows 0 to 9.\n\nMy position: (0,9)\n\nApple at (0,2): straight down, no obstacles seen in between.\n\nWait, but looking at the board state, row 2 has an 'A' at (0,2). From (0,9) to (0,2), that's moving down 7 rows.\n\nIs there any part of my body in the way? No, since I just started, I only have the head.\n\nSimilarly, is there any other snake in the way? Snake 1 is at (4,0), which is lower right.\n\nSo, path to (0,2): move down 7 steps.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider eating multiple apples in one go.\n\nLet me see: if I go to (0,2), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving right would take me towards (7,1) and (8,1), which are lower down.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up to (9,4), but that's farther.\n\nAlternatively, (5,5) is also an option.\n\nLet me think about a sequence.\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Go to (0,2): 7 steps down.\n\n2. After eating (0,2), I'm longer, so I need to be careful.\n\n3. From (0,2), I can move right to (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (7,1) is 7 steps right and 1 step down.\n\nWait, (7,1) is at column 7, row 1.\n\nFrom (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\nSo, from (0,2):\n\n- Move right 7 steps to (7,2)\n\n- Then down 1 step to (7,1)\n\n- Eat apple at (7,1)\n\n- Now, move right 1 step to (8,1) to eat another apple.\n\nTotal steps from start: 7 (down) + 7 (right) + 1 (down) + 1 (right) = 16 steps.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nOption 2:\n\nGo directly to (5,5):\n\nFrom (0,9) to (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nBut wait, in option 1, it was 16 steps for three apples, while option 2 is 14 steps for two apples.\n\nBut in option 1, I can potentially get three apples in 16 steps, while in option 2, only two in 14 steps.\n\nNot sure, need to think carefully.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Each time I eat an apple, my tail grows.\n\nSo, after eating (0,2), my tail will be longer, and I need to make sure I don't bump into it when making turns.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apples that are closer to each other first.\n\nLooking at the board, apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent.\n\nSo, maybe go to (7,1), eat it, then go to (8,1), eat it, then proceed to another apple.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps\n\n- Then right to (7,1): 7 steps\n\n- Eat (7,1)\n\n- Then right to (8,1): 1 step\n\n- Eat (8,1)\n\n- Now, where to next? (0,2), (5,5), or (9,4).\n\nFrom (8,1), to (5,5): |8-5| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps.\n\nTotal steps so far: 8 + 7 + 1 + 7 = 23 steps.\n\nThat seems too many.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), go up to (8,9), then left to (0,9), then down to (0,2), etc.\n\nBut that would be a very long detour.\n\nMaybe not efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (9,4).\n\nFrom (0,9), going to (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nThen from (9,4), I can go left to (5,4), then up to (5,5) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), so from (9,4), to (5,5): |9-5| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 14 + 5 = 19 steps.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best path.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (4,0), and it's just the head, no body.\n\nI need to make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nI don't know how the enemy snake will move, so I should assume it could move in any direction.\n\nBut for now, I'll plan my path assuming it stays put or moves in a way that doesn't block me.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to predict its movement based on the apple positions.\n\nBut perhaps that's too complicated for now.\n\nI need to make a decision for my next move.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by moving down towards the closest apple at (0,2).\n\nFrom (0,9), moving down to (0,2) is a straight path with no obstacles.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move down.\n\nBut wait, I need to specify left, right, up, or down.\n\nIn terms of coordinates:\n\n- Down corresponds to decreasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Up corresponds to increasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Left corresponds to decreasing x-coordinate.\n\n- Right corresponds to increasing x-coordinate.\n\nSo, to move down from (0,9) to (0,8), I should choose down.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, my next"

There don't seem to be any obstacles in that path, so that might be a safe starting point.\n\nBut I also need to think about what to do after eating that apple. After eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have a path that allows me to extend without bumping into myself.\n\nLet me consider the positions after eating (0,2). Once I eat it, my tail will extend, so I need to plan my moves carefully to avoid my own body.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), perhaps I can move right towards the apples at (7,1) and (8,1). From (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1) to eat another apple, and then to (8,1) for the third apple. That seems like a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (5,5) after (0,2). From (0,2), I can move right to (5,2), then up to (5,5). That's another option.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake at (4,0). I don't know how it will move, so I should assume it could potentially block some paths. For now, I'll plan my path away from it initially and see.\n\nLet me also look at the other apples. The apple at (9,4) is quite far away, requiring a move down to (0,4) and then right to (9,4), which is a long path and might not be efficient in the short term.\n\nSimilarly, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are in the lower right area. If I can pick up multiple apples in that area after getting (0,2), that would be ideal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for (0,2), then (7,1), then (8,1). Let's map that out.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 7 + 7 + 1 + 1 = 16 steps.\n\nThat seems manageable. Now, after eating three apples, my snake would be quite long, so I need to ensure that the path doesn't loop back on itself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (0,2), then up to (0,5), then right to (5,5) to get the apple there. But that seems less efficient because (5,5) is farther than (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nWait, from (0,2), moving up to (0,5) is actually moving up 3 steps, then right to (5,5), which is 5 steps right. That's 3 + 5 = 8 steps after the initial 7 steps to (0,2), totaling 15 steps for three apples. Hmm, that might be better.\n\nBut let's see: (0,2) to (0,5): up 3, then right to (5,5): 5 steps. That's a total of 7 + 3 + 5 = 15 steps.\n\nCompared to the previous path of 16 steps, this is shorter. However, I need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board, from (0,2) up to (0,5), then right to (5,5). It seems clear, but I need to make sure that I won't be bumping into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,5), I could then head over to (9,4). From (5,5), right to (9,5), then down to (9,4). That's 4 steps right and 1 step down, totaling 5 steps.\n\nSo, overall steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 3 (up to 0,5) + 5 (right to 5,5) + 4 (right to 9,5) + 1 (down to 9,4) = 7 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 20 steps.\n\nBut wait, after eating (5,5), my snake is longer, so I need to ensure that I can make these moves without hitting my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (5,5), I can go directly down to (5,4), then right to (9,4). That's 1 step down and 4 steps right, totaling 5 steps.\n\nOverall steps: 7 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 4 = still 20 steps.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nLet me consider going for (0,2), then directly to (9,4). From (0,2), right to (9,2), then down to (9,4). That's 9 steps right and 2 steps down, totaling 11 steps after the initial 7 steps, for a total of 18 steps.\n\nBut in this path, I would miss the apples at (7,1) and (8,1), which might not be optimal in terms of points, but it's faster in terms of steps.\n\nI need to balance between maximizing points and minimizing risk.\n\nAlso, I should consider that the enemy snake might be moving and potentially blocking my path.\n\nBut since I don't know its movement pattern, I'll have to plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for the apples that are closer together first, to minimize movement steps and maximize points.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent, so picking them up in sequence would be efficient.\n\nTo reach (7,1), from (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,1): 7 steps.\n\nTotal: 15 steps.\n\nThen, from (7,1), right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 16 steps for two apples.\n\nComparing to the previous path of 18 steps for two apples, this seems better.\n\nAfter that, I can head to (0,2), but that's now at (0,2), which is up left from (8,1). That would require:\n\n- Left to (8,2): 1 step.\n\n- Up to (8,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Left to (0,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\nThat's 1 + 8 + 8 + 7 = 24 steps, which is a lot.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), I could go up to (8,4), then right to (9,4) to get the apple there.\n\nFrom (8,1), up to (8,4): 3 steps.\n\nThen right to (9,4): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 15 (to 7,1) + 1 (to 8,1) + 3 (up to 8,4) + 1 (right to 9,4) = 20 steps for four apples.\n\nThen, finally, go to (5,5). From (9,4), left to (5,4): 4 steps.\n\nThen up to (5,5): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 20 + 4 + 1 = 25 steps for five apples.\n\nThis seems like a possible strategy.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself in these maneuvers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by going for (0,2), then (7,1), (8,1), (9,4), and finally (5,5).\n\nWait, but to get from (8,1) to (9,4), it's right to (9,1), then up to (9,4): 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n\nSo, total steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 7 (right to 7,2) + 1 (down to 7,1) + 1 (right to 8,1) + 1 (right to 9,1) + 3 (up to 9,4) + left to (5,4) + up to (5,5).\n\nWait, that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I need to sketch this out.\n\nLet's try to plan a path:\n\nStart at (0,9).\n\n1. Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n2. Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n3. Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n4. Right to (8,1):"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (0,9). That's the top-left corner, right? Let me confirm: coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. So (0,9) is indeed the top-left.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: 2 (me) and some dots.\n\nRow 8: All dots.\n\nRow 7: All dots.\n\nRow 6: All dots.\n\nRow 5: An apple at (5,5).\n\nRow 4: An apple at (9,4).\n\nRow 3: All dots.\n\nRow 2: An apple at (0,2).\n\nRow 1: Apples at (8,1) and (7,1).\n\nRow 0: An apple at (4,0) and snake 1 at (4,0).\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,0), which is also where there's an apple. Does that mean snake 1 is on top of the apple, or is the apple still there? The board shows a '1' and an 'A' at (4,0), but maybe the '1' is the snake and 'A' is the apple. Hmm, that might be confusing.\n\nAlso, snake 1 has an empty body list, so it's just the head at (4,0). Me too, since I don't see any body parts listed for me.\n\nSo, my position: (0,9)\n\nApples at: (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), (7,1)\n\nEnemy snake at: (4,0)\n\nI need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential risks.\n\nLet me calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (0,9):\n\n1. (0,2): Distance is |0-0| + |9-2| = 0 + 7 = 7 steps.\n\n2. (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\n3. (8,1): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16 steps.\n\n4. (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\n5. (7,1): |0-7| + |9-1| = 7 + 8 = 15 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (0,2), 7 steps away.\n\nBut I should also consider the path to each apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet's visualize the grid:\n\nColumns 0 to 9, rows 0 to 9.\n\nMy position: (0,9)\n\nApple at (0,2): straight down, no obstacles seen in between.\n\nWait, but looking at the board state, row 2 has an 'A' at (0,2). From (0,9) to (0,2), that's moving down 7 rows.\n\nIs there any part of my body in the way? No, since I just started, I only have the head.\n\nSimilarly, is there any other snake in the way? Snake 1 is at (4,0), which is lower right.\n\nSo, path to (0,2): move down 7 steps.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider eating multiple apples in one go.\n\nLet me see: if I go to (0,2), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving right would take me towards (7,1) and (8,1), which are lower down.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up to (9,4), but that's farther.\n\nAlternatively, (5,5) is also an option.\n\nLet me think about a sequence.\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Go to (0,2): 7 steps down.\n\n2. After eating (0,2), I'm longer, so I need to be careful.\n\n3. From (0,2), I can move right to (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (7,1) is 7 steps right and 1 step down.\n\nWait, (7,1) is at column 7, row 1.\n\nFrom (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\nSo, from (0,2):\n\n- Move right 7 steps to (7,2)\n\n- Then down 1 step to (7,1)\n\n- Eat apple at (7,1)\n\n- Now, move right 1 step to (8,1) to eat another apple.\n\nTotal steps from start: 7 (down) + 7 (right) + 1 (down) + 1 (right) = 16 steps.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nOption 2:\n\nGo directly to (5,5):\n\nFrom (0,9) to (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nBut wait, in option 1, it was 16 steps for three apples, while option 2 is 14 steps for two apples.\n\nBut in option 1, I can potentially get three apples in 16 steps, while in option 2, only two in 14 steps.\n\nNot sure, need to think carefully.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Each time I eat an apple, my tail grows.\n\nSo, after eating (0,2), my tail will be longer, and I need to make sure I don't bump into it when making turns.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apples that are closer to each other first.\n\nLooking at the board, apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent.\n\nSo, maybe go to (7,1), eat it, then go to (8,1), eat it, then proceed to another apple.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps\n\n- Then right to (7,1): 7 steps\n\n- Eat (7,1)\n\n- Then right to (8,1): 1 step\n\n- Eat (8,1)\n\n- Now, where to next? (0,2), (5,5), or (9,4).\n\nFrom (8,1), to (5,5): |8-5| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps.\n\nTotal steps so far: 8 + 7 + 1 + 7 = 23 steps.\n\nThat seems too many.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), go up to (8,9), then left to (0,9), then down to (0,2), etc.\n\nBut that would be a very long detour.\n\nMaybe not efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (9,4).\n\nFrom (0,9), going to (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nThen from (9,4), I can go left to (5,4), then up to (5,5) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), so from (9,4), to (5,5): |9-5| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 14 + 5 = 19 steps.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best path.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (4,0), and it's just the head, no body.\n\nI need to make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nI don't know how the enemy snake will move, so I should assume it could move in any direction.\n\nBut for now, I'll plan my path assuming it stays put or moves in a way that doesn't block me.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to predict its movement based on the apple positions.\n\nBut perhaps that's too complicated for now.\n\nI need to make a decision for my next move.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by moving down towards the closest apple at (0,2).\n\nFrom (0,9), moving down to (0,2) is a straight path with no obstacles.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move down.\n\nBut wait, I need to specify left, right, up, or down.\n\nIn terms of coordinates:\n\n- Down corresponds to decreasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Up corresponds to increasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Left corresponds to decreasing x-coordinate.\n\n- Right corresponds to increasing x-coordinate.\n\nSo, to move down from (0,9) to (0,8), I should choose down.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, my next"

From (9,4), left to (5,4): 4 steps.\n\nThen up to (5,5): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 20 + 4 + 1 = 25 steps for five apples.\n\nThis seems like a possible strategy.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself in these maneuvers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by going for (0,2), then (7,1), (8,1), (9,4), and finally (5,5).\n\nWait, but to get from (8,1) to (9,4), it's right to (9,1), then up to (9,4): 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n\nSo, total steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 7 (right to 7,2) + 1 (down to 7,1) + 1 (right to 8,1) + 1 (right to 9,1) + 3 (up to 9,4) + left to (5,4) + up to (5,5).\n\nWait, that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I need to sketch this out.\n\nLet's try to plan a path:\n\nStart at (0,9).\n\n1. Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n2. Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n3. Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n4. Right to (8,1):"

There's also an enemy snake at (3,1).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to collect as many apples as possible without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nLet me look at the positions:\n\n- I'm at (1,8).\n\n- Apples are at (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), and (7,1).\n\n- Enemy snake is at (3,1).\n\nI should consider the distances to each apple and plan a path that allows me to pick them up efficiently.\n\nLet's consider the Manhattan distance from my current position to each apple:\n\n- (0,2): |1-0| + |8-2| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n- (9,4): |1-9| + |8-4| = 8 + 4 = 12\n\n- (8,1): |1-8| + |8-1| = 7 + 7 = 14\n\n- (5,5): |1-5| + |8-5| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- (7,1): |1-7| + |8-1| = 6 + 7 = 13\n\nSo, the closest apples are (0,2) and (5,5), both with a distance of 7.\n\nI should consider which path might be better, considering the positions of other apples.\n\nLet's visualize the board:\n\n- (0,0) is bottom-left, (9,9) is top-right.\n\n- My snake is at (1,8), which is near the top.\n\n- Apples:\n\n  - (0,2): left, down\n\n  - (9,4): right, down\n\n  - (8,1): right, down\n\n  - (5,5): somewhat center\n\n  - (7,1): right, down\n\n- Enemy snake at (3,1): somewhat below me.\n\nFirst, I need to avoid the enemy snake.

If I can avoid that area, especially while the enemy might be moving, it's better.\n\nIn this path, I'm going down to (1,5), then right to (5,5), then right to (9,5), down to (9,4), left to (7,4), down to (7,1), and right to (8,1).\n\nThe enemy is at (3,1), which is below my path mostly, so as long as I don't go directly into its position, I should be fine.\n\nBut I need to be cautious, especially when moving down.\n\nAlso, after eating each apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me back to my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Start at (1,8)\n\n2. Down to (1,5)\n\n3. Right to (5,5)\n\n4. Right to (9,5)\n\n5. Down to (9,4)\n\n6. Left to (7,4)\n\n7. Down to (7,1)\n\n8. Right to (8,1)\n\nAt each step, after eating an apple, my tail extends.\n\nI need to ensure that the next move doesn't step on the new tail positions.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,5), my tail will have grown, so I need to make sure that moving right to (9,5) doesn't cause me to run into my own tail.\n\nSimilarly, after eating (9,4), moving left to (7,4) should be safe, provided I have a long enough path without hitting myself.\n\nThis seems manageable, but I need to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apples that are closer together first to minimize movement.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent, so picking them up in sequence would be efficient.\n\nFrom (1,8):\n\n- Down to (1,1): 7 steps\n\n- Right to (7,1): 6 steps\n\nTotal: 7 + 6 = 13 steps to (7,1)\n\nThen, right to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 1 step\n\nThen, up"

Let me confirm: coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. So (0,9) is indeed the top-left.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: 2 (me) and some dots.\n\nRow 8: All dots.\n\nRow 7: All dots.\n\nRow 6: All dots.\n\nRow 5: An apple at (5,5).\n\nRow 4: An apple at (9,4).\n\nRow 3: All dots.\n\nRow 2: An apple at (0,2).\n\nRow 1: Apples at (8,1) and (7,1).\n\nRow 0: An apple at (4,0) and snake 1 at (4,0).\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,0), which is also where there's an apple. Does that mean snake 1 is on top of the apple, or is the apple still there? The board shows a '1' and an 'A' at (4,0), but maybe the '1' is the snake and 'A' is the apple. Hmm, that might be confusing.\n\nAlso, snake 1 has an empty body list, so it's just the head at (4,0). Me too, since I don't see any body parts listed for me.\n\nSo, my position: (0,9)\n\nApples at: (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), (7,1)\n\nEnemy snake at: (4,0)\n\nI need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential risks.\n\nLet me calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (0,9):\n\n1. (0,2): Distance is |0-0| + |9-2| = 0 + 7 = 7 steps.\n\n2. (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\n3. (8,1): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16 steps.\n\n4. (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\n5. (7,1): |0-7| + |9-1| = 7 + 8 = 15 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (0,2), 7 steps away.\n\nBut I should also consider the path to each apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet's visualize the grid:\n\nColumns 0 to 9, rows 0 to 9.\n\nMy position: (0,9)\n\nApple at (0,2): straight down, no obstacles seen in between.\n\nWait, but looking at the board state, row 2 has an 'A' at (0,2). From (0,9) to (0,2), that's moving down 7 rows.\n\nIs there any part of my body in the way? No, since I just started, I only have the head.\n\nSimilarly, is there any other snake in the way? Snake 1 is at (4,0), which is lower right.\n\nSo, path to (0,2): move down 7 steps.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider eating multiple apples in one go.\n\nLet me see: if I go to (0,2), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving right would take me towards (7,1) and (8,1), which are lower down.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up to (9,4), but that's farther.\n\nAlternatively, (5,5) is also an option.\n\nLet me think about a sequence.\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Go to (0,2): 7 steps down.\n\n2. After eating (0,2), I'm longer, so I need to be careful.\n\n3. From (0,2), I can move right to (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (7,1) is 7 steps right and 1 step down.\n\nWait, (7,1) is at column 7, row 1.\n\nFrom (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\nSo, from (0,2):\n\n- Move right 7 steps to (7,2)\n\n- Then down 1 step to (7,1)\n\n- Eat apple at (7,1)\n\n- Now, move right 1 step to (8,1) to eat another apple.\n\nTotal steps from start: 7 (down) + 7 (right) + 1 (down) + 1 (right) = 16 steps.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nOption 2:\n\nGo directly to (5,5):\n\nFrom (0,9) to (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nBut wait, in option 1, it was 16 steps for three apples, while option 2 is 14 steps for two apples.\n\nBut in option 1, I can potentially get three apples in 16 steps, while in option 2, only two in 14 steps.\n\nNot sure, need to think carefully.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Each time I eat an apple, my tail grows.\n\nSo, after eating (0,2), my tail will be longer, and I need to make sure I don't bump into it when making turns.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apples that are closer to each other first.\n\nLooking at the board, apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent.\n\nSo, maybe go to (7,1), eat it, then go to (8,1), eat it, then proceed to another apple.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps\n\n- Then right to (7,1): 7 steps\n\n- Eat (7,1)\n\n- Then right to (8,1): 1 step\n\n- Eat (8,1)\n\n- Now, where to next? (0,2), (5,5), or (9,4).\n\nFrom (8,1), to (5,5): |8-5| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps.\n\nTotal steps so far: 8 + 7 + 1 + 7 = 23 steps.\n\nThat seems too many.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), go up to (8,9), then left to (0,9), then down to (0,2), etc.\n\nBut that would be a very long detour.\n\nMaybe not efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (9,4).\n\nFrom (0,9), going to (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nThen from (9,4), I can go left to (5,4), then up to (5,5) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), so from (9,4), to (5,5): |9-5| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 14 + 5 = 19 steps.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best path.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (4,0), and it's just the head, no body.\n\nI need to make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nI don't know how the enemy snake will move, so I should assume it could move in any direction.\n\nBut for now, I'll plan my path assuming it stays put or moves in a way that doesn't block me.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to predict its movement based on the apple positions.\n\nBut perhaps that's too complicated for now.\n\nI need to make a decision for my next move.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by moving down towards the closest apple at (0,2).\n\nFrom (0,9), moving down to (0,2) is a straight path with no obstacles.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move down.\n\nBut wait, I need to specify left, right, up, or down.\n\nIn terms of coordinates:\n\n- Down corresponds to decreasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Up corresponds to increasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Left corresponds to decreasing x-coordinate.\n\n- Right corresponds to increasing x-coordinate.\n\nSo, to move down from (0,9) to (0,8), I should choose down.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, my next"

There are five apples on the board: at (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), and (7,1). There's also an enemy snake at (4,0).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (0,2), which is straight down from my current position. Let's calculate the distance: from (0,9) to (0,2), that's a vertical move down by 7 steps. There don't seem to be any obstacles in that path, so that might be a safe starting point.\n\nBut I also need to think about what to do after eating that apple. After eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have a path that allows me to extend without bumping into myself.\n\nLet me consider the positions after eating (0,2). Once I eat it, my tail will extend, so I need to plan my moves carefully to avoid my own body.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), perhaps I can move right towards the apples at (7,1) and (8,1). From (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1) to eat another apple, and then to (8,1) for the third apple. That seems like a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (5,5) after (0,2). From (0,2), I can move right to (5,2), then up to (5,5). That's another option.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake at (4,0). I don't know how it will move, so I should assume it could potentially block some paths. For now, I'll plan my path away from it initially and see.\n\nLet me also look at the other apples. The apple at (9,4) is quite far away, requiring a move down to (0,4) and then right to (9,4), which is a long path and might not be efficient in the short term.\n\nSimilarly, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are in the lower right area.

Let's map that out.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 7 + 7 + 1 + 1 = 16 steps.\n\nThat seems manageable. Now, after eating three apples, my snake would be quite long, so I need to ensure that the path doesn't loop back on itself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (0,2), then up to (0,5), then right to (5,5) to get the apple there. But that seems less efficient because (5,5) is farther than (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nWait, from (0,2), moving up to (0,5) is actually moving up 3 steps, then right to (5,5), which is 5 steps right. That's 3 + 5 = 8 steps after the initial 7 steps to (0,2), totaling 15 steps for three apples. Hmm, that might be better.\n\nBut let's see: (0,2) to (0,5): up 3, then right to (5,5): 5 steps. That's a total of 7 + 3 + 5 = 15 steps.\n\nCompared to the previous path of 16 steps, this is shorter. However, I need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board, from (0,2) up to (0,5), then right to (5,5). It seems clear, but I need to make sure that I won't be bumping into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,5), I could then head over to (9,4). From (5,5), right to (9,5), then down to (9,4). That's 4 steps right and 1 step down, totaling 5 steps.\n\nSo, overall steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 3 (up to 0,5) + 5 (right to 5,5) + 4 (right to 9,5) + 1 (down to 9,4) = 7 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 20 steps.\n\nBut wait, after eating (5,5), my snake is longer, so I need to ensure that I can make these moves without hitting my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (5,5), I can go directly down to (5,4), then right to (9,4). That's 1 step down and 4 steps right, totaling 5 steps.\n\nOverall steps: 7 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 4 = still 20 steps.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nLet me consider going for (0,2), then directly to (9,4). From (0,2), right to (9,2), then down to (9,4). That's 9 steps right and 2 steps down, totaling 11 steps after the initial 7 steps, for a total of 18 steps.\n\nBut in this path, I would miss the apples at (7,1) and (8,1), which might not be optimal in terms of points, but it's faster in terms of steps.\n\nI need to balance between maximizing points and minimizing risk.\n\nAlso, I should consider that the enemy snake might be moving and potentially blocking my path.\n\nBut since I don't know its movement pattern, I'll have to plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for the apples that are closer together first, to minimize movement steps and maximize points.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent, so picking them up in sequence would be efficient.\n\nTo reach (7,1), from (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,1): 7 steps.\n\nTotal: 15 steps.\n\nThen, from (7,1), right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 16 steps for two apples.\n\nComparing to the previous path of 18 steps for two apples, this seems better.\n\nAfter that, I can head to (0,2), but that's now at (0,2), which is up left from (8,1). That would require:\n\n- Left to (8,2): 1 step.\n\n- Up to (8,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Left to (0,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\nThat's 1 + 8 + 8 + 7 = 24 steps, which is a lot.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), I could go up to (8,4), then right to (9,4) to get the apple there.\n\nFrom (8,1), up to (8,4): 3 steps.\n\nThen right to (9,4): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 15 (to 7,1) + 1 (to 8,1) + 3 (up to 8,4) + 1 (right to 9,4) = 20 steps for four apples.\n\nThen, finally, go to (5,5). From (9,4), left to (5,4): 4 steps.\n\nThen up to (5,5): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 20 + 4 + 1 = 25 steps for five apples.\n\nThis seems like a possible strategy.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself in these maneuvers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by going for (0,2), then (7,1), (8,1), (9,4), and finally (5,5).\n\nWait, but to get from (8,1) to (9,4), it's right to (9,1), then up to (9,4): 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n\nSo, total steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 7 (right to 7,2) + 1 (down to 7,1) + 1 (right to 8,1) + 1 (right to 9,1) + 3 (up to 9,4) + left to (5,4) + up to (5,5).\n\nWait, that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I need to sketch this out.\n\nLet's try to plan a path:\n\nStart at (0,9).\n\n1. Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n2. Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n3. Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n4. Right to (8,1):"

Let me confirm: coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. So (0,9) is indeed the top-left.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: 2 (me) and some dots.\n\nRow 8: All dots.\n\nRow 7: All dots.\n\nRow 6: All dots.\n\nRow 5: An apple at (5,5).\n\nRow 4: An apple at (9,4).\n\nRow 3: All dots.\n\nRow 2: An apple at (0,2).\n\nRow 1: Apples at (8,1) and (7,1).\n\nRow 0: An apple at (4,0) and snake 1 at (4,0).\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,0), which is also where there's an apple. Does that mean snake 1 is on top of the apple, or is the apple still there? The board shows a '1' and an 'A' at (4,0), but maybe the '1' is the snake and 'A' is the apple. Hmm, that might be confusing.\n\nAlso, snake 1 has an empty body list, so it's just the head at (4,0). Me too, since I don't see any body parts listed for me.\n\nSo, my position: (0,9)\n\nApples at: (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), (7,1)\n\nEnemy snake at: (4,0)\n\nI need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential risks.\n\nLet me calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (0,9):\n\n1. (0,2): Distance is |0-0| + |9-2| = 0 + 7 = 7 steps.\n\n2. (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\n3. (8,1): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16 steps.\n\n4. (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\n5. (7,1): |0-7| + |9-1| = 7 + 8 = 15 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (0,2), 7 steps away.\n\nBut I should also consider the path to each apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet's visualize the grid:\n\nColumns 0 to 9, rows 0 to 9.\n\nMy position: (0,9)\n\nApple at (0,2): straight down, no obstacles seen in between.\n\nWait, but looking at the board state, row 2 has an 'A' at (0,2). From (0,9) to (0,2), that's moving down 7 rows.\n\nIs there any part of my body in the way? No, since I just started, I only have the head.\n\nSimilarly, is there any other snake in the way? Snake 1 is at (4,0), which is lower right.\n\nSo, path to (0,2): move down 7 steps.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider eating multiple apples in one go.\n\nLet me see: if I go to (0,2), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving right would take me towards (7,1) and (8,1), which are lower down.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up to (9,4), but that's farther.\n\nAlternatively, (5,5) is also an option.\n\nLet me think about a sequence.\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Go to (0,2): 7 steps down.\n\n2. After eating (0,2), I'm longer, so I need to be careful.\n\n3. From (0,2), I can move right to (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (7,1) is 7 steps right and 1 step down.\n\nWait, (7,1) is at column 7, row 1.\n\nFrom (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\nSo, from (0,2):\n\n- Move right 7 steps to (7,2)\n\n- Then down 1 step to (7,1)\n\n- Eat apple at (7,1)\n\n- Now, move right 1 step to (8,1) to eat another apple.\n\nTotal steps from start: 7 (down) + 7 (right) + 1 (down) + 1 (right) = 16 steps.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nOption 2:\n\nGo directly to (5,5):\n\nFrom (0,9) to (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nBut wait, in option 1, it was 16 steps for three apples, while option 2 is 14 steps for two apples.\n\nBut in option 1, I can potentially get three apples in 16 steps, while in option 2, only two in 14 steps.\n\nNot sure, need to think carefully.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Each time I eat an apple, my tail grows.\n\nSo, after eating (0,2), my tail will be longer, and I need to make sure I don't bump into it when making turns.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apples that are closer to each other first.\n\nLooking at the board, apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent.\n\nSo, maybe go to (7,1), eat it, then go to (8,1), eat it, then proceed to another apple.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps\n\n- Then right to (7,1): 7 steps\n\n- Eat (7,1)\n\n- Then right to (8,1): 1 step\n\n- Eat (8,1)\n\n- Now, where to next? (0,2), (5,5), or (9,4).\n\nFrom (8,1), to (5,5): |8-5| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps.\n\nTotal steps so far: 8 + 7 + 1 + 7 = 23 steps.\n\nThat seems too many.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), go up to (8,9), then left to (0,9), then down to (0,2), etc.\n\nBut that would be a very long detour.\n\nMaybe not efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (9,4).\n\nFrom (0,9), going to (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nThen from (9,4), I can go left to (5,4), then up to (5,5) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), so from (9,4), to (5,5): |9-5| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 14 + 5 = 19 steps.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best path.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (4,0), and it's just the head, no body.\n\nI need to make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nI don't know how the enemy snake will move, so I should assume it could move in any direction.\n\nBut for now, I'll plan my path assuming it stays put or moves in a way that doesn't block me.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to predict its movement based on the apple positions.\n\nBut perhaps that's too complicated for now.\n\nI need to make a decision for my next move.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by moving down towards the closest apple at (0,2).\n\nFrom (0,9), moving down to (0,2) is a straight path with no obstacles.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move down.\n\nBut wait, I need to specify left, right, up, or down.\n\nIn terms of coordinates:\n\n- Down corresponds to decreasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Up corresponds to increasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Left corresponds to decreasing x-coordinate.\n\n- Right corresponds to increasing x-coordinate.\n\nSo, to move down from (0,9) to (0,8), I should choose down.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, my next"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. So, I'm currently at position (0,9), which is the top-left corner of the board. There are five apples on the board: at (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), and (7,1). There's also an enemy snake at (4,0).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (0,2), which is straight down from my current position. Let's calculate the distance: from (0,9) to (0,2), that's a vertical move down by 7 steps. There don't seem to be any obstacles in that path, so that might be a safe starting point.\n\nBut I also need to think about what to do after eating that apple. After eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have a path that allows me to extend without bumping into myself.\n\nLet me consider the positions after eating (0,2). Once I eat it, my tail will extend, so I need to plan my moves carefully to avoid my own body.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), perhaps I can move right towards the apples at (7,1) and (8,1). From (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1) to eat another apple, and then to (8,1) for the third apple. That seems like a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (5,5) after (0,2). From (0,2), I can move right to (5,2), then up to (5,5). That's another option.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake at (4,0). I don't know how it will move, so I should assume it could potentially block some paths. For now, I'll plan my path away from it initially and see.\n\nLet me also look at the other apples. The apple at (9,4) is quite far away, requiring a move down to (0,4) and then right to (9,4), which is a long path and might not be efficient in the short term.\n\nSimilarly, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are in the lower right area. If I can pick up multiple apples in that area after getting (0,2), that would be ideal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for (0,2), then (7,1), then (8,1). Let's map that out.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 7 + 7 + 1 + 1 = 16 steps.\n\nThat seems manageable. Now, after eating three apples, my snake would be quite long, so I need to ensure that the path doesn't loop back on itself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (0,2), then up to (0,5), then right to (5,5) to get the apple there. But that seems less efficient because (5,5) is farther than (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nWait, from (0,2), moving up to (0,5) is actually moving up 3 steps, then right to (5,5), which is 5 steps right. That's 3 + 5 = 8 steps after the initial 7 steps to (0,2), totaling 15 steps for three apples. Hmm, that might be better.\n\nBut let's see: (0,2) to (0,5): up 3, then right to (5,5): 5 steps. That's a total of 7 + 3 + 5 = 15 steps.\n\nCompared to the previous path of 16 steps, this is shorter. However, I need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board, from (0,2) up to (0,5), then right to (5,5). It seems clear, but I need to make sure that I won't be bumping into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,5), I could then head over to (9,4). From (5,5), right to (9,5), then down to (9,4). That's 4 steps right and 1 step down, totaling 5 steps.\n\nSo, overall steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 3 (up to 0,5) + 5 (right to 5,5) + 4 (right to 9,5) + 1 (down to 9,4) = 7 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 20 steps.\n\nBut wait, after eating (5,5), my snake is longer, so I need to ensure that I can make these moves without hitting my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (5,5), I can go directly down to (5,4), then right to (9,4). That's 1 step down and 4 steps right, totaling 5 steps.\n\nOverall steps: 7 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 4 = still 20 steps.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nLet me consider going for (0,2), then directly to (9,4). From (0,2), right to (9,2), then down to (9,4). That's 9 steps right and 2 steps down, totaling 11 steps after the initial 7 steps, for a total of 18 steps.\n\nBut in this path, I would miss the apples at (7,1) and (8,1), which might not be optimal in terms of points, but it's faster in terms of steps.\n\nI need to balance between maximizing points and minimizing risk.\n\nAlso, I should consider that the enemy snake might be moving and potentially blocking my path.\n\nBut since I don't know its movement pattern, I'll have to plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for the apples that are closer together first, to minimize movement steps and maximize points.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent, so picking them up in sequence would be efficient.\n\nTo reach (7,1), from (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,1): 7 steps.\n\nTotal: 15 steps.\n\nThen, from (7,1), right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 16 steps for two apples.\n\nComparing to the previous path of 18 steps for two apples, this seems better.\n\nAfter that, I can head to (0,2), but that's now at (0,2), which is up left from (8,1). That would require:\n\n- Left to (8,2): 1 step.\n\n- Up to (8,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Left to (0,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\nThat's 1 + 8 + 8 + 7 = 24 steps, which is a lot.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), I could go up to (8,4), then right to (9,4) to get the apple there.\n\nFrom (8,1), up to (8,4): 3 steps.\n\nThen right to (9,4): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 15 (to 7,1) + 1 (to 8,1) + 3 (up to 8,4) + 1 (right to 9,4) = 20 steps for four apples.\n\nThen, finally, go to (5,5). From (9,4), left to (5,4): 4 steps.\n\nThen up to (5,5): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 20 + 4 + 1 = 25 steps for five apples.\n\nThis seems like a possible strategy.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself in these maneuvers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by going for (0,2), then (7,1), (8,1), (9,4), and finally (5,5).\n\nWait, but to get from (8,1) to (9,4), it's right to (9,1), then up to (9,4): 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n\nSo, total steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 7 (right to 7,2) + 1 (down to 7,1) + 1 (right to 8,1) + 1 (right to 9,1) + 3 (up to 9,4) + left to (5,4) + up to (5,5).\n\nWait, that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I need to sketch this out.\n\nLet's try to plan a path:\n\nStart at (0,9).\n\n1. Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n2. Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n3. Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n4. Right to (8,1):"

Let me confirm: coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. So (0,9) is indeed the top-left.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: 2 (me) and some dots.\n\nRow 8: All dots.\n\nRow 7: All dots.\n\nRow 6: All dots.\n\nRow 5: An apple at (5,5).\n\nRow 4: An apple at (9,4).\n\nRow 3: All dots.\n\nRow 2: An apple at (0,2).\n\nRow 1: Apples at (8,1) and (7,1).\n\nRow 0: An apple at (4,0) and snake 1 at (4,0).\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,0), which is also where there's an apple. Does that mean snake 1 is on top of the apple, or is the apple still there? The board shows a '1' and an 'A' at (4,0), but maybe the '1' is the snake and 'A' is the apple. Hmm, that might be confusing.\n\nAlso, snake 1 has an empty body list, so it's just the head at (4,0). Me too, since I don't see any body parts listed for me.\n\nSo, my position: (0,9)\n\nApples at: (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), (7,1)\n\nEnemy snake at: (4,0)\n\nI need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential risks.\n\nLet me calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (0,9):\n\n1. (0,2): Distance is |0-0| + |9-2| = 0 + 7 = 7 steps.\n\n2. (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\n3. (8,1): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16 steps.\n\n4. (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\n5. (7,1): |0-7| + |9-1| = 7 + 8 = 15 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (0,2), 7 steps away.\n\nBut I should also consider the path to each apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet's visualize the grid:\n\nColumns 0 to 9, rows 0 to 9.\n\nMy position: (0,9)\n\nApple at (0,2): straight down, no obstacles seen in between.\n\nWait, but looking at the board state, row 2 has an 'A' at (0,2). From (0,9) to (0,2), that's moving down 7 rows.\n\nIs there any part of my body in the way? No, since I just started, I only have the head.\n\nSimilarly, is there any other snake in the way? Snake 1 is at (4,0), which is lower right.\n\nSo, path to (0,2): move down 7 steps.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider eating multiple apples in one go.\n\nLet me see: if I go to (0,2), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving right would take me towards (7,1) and (8,1), which are lower down.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up to (9,4), but that's farther.\n\nAlternatively, (5,5) is also an option.\n\nLet me think about a sequence.\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Go to (0,2): 7 steps down.\n\n2. After eating (0,2), I'm longer, so I need to be careful.\n\n3. From (0,2), I can move right to (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (7,1) is 7 steps right and 1 step down.\n\nWait, (7,1) is at column 7, row 1.\n\nFrom (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\nSo, from (0,2):\n\n- Move right 7 steps to (7,2)\n\n- Then down 1 step to (7,1)\n\n- Eat apple at (7,1)\n\n- Now, move right 1 step to (8,1) to eat another apple.\n\nTotal steps from start: 7 (down) + 7 (right) + 1 (down) + 1 (right) = 16 steps.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nOption 2:\n\nGo directly to (5,5):\n\nFrom (0,9) to (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nBut wait, in option 1, it was 16 steps for three apples, while option 2 is 14 steps for two apples.\n\nBut in option 1, I can potentially get three apples in 16 steps, while in option 2, only two in 14 steps.\n\nNot sure, need to think carefully.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Each time I eat an apple, my tail grows.\n\nSo, after eating (0,2), my tail will be longer, and I need to make sure I don't bump into it when making turns.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apples that are closer to each other first.\n\nLooking at the board, apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent.\n\nSo, maybe go to (7,1), eat it, then go to (8,1), eat it, then proceed to another apple.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps\n\n- Then right to (7,1): 7 steps\n\n- Eat (7,1)\n\n- Then right to (8,1): 1 step\n\n- Eat (8,1)\n\n- Now, where to next? (0,2), (5,5), or (9,4).\n\nFrom (8,1), to (5,5): |8-5| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps.\n\nTotal steps so far: 8 + 7 + 1 + 7 = 23 steps.\n\nThat seems too many.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), go up to (8,9), then left to (0,9), then down to (0,2), etc.\n\nBut that would be a very long detour.\n\nMaybe not efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (9,4).\n\nFrom (0,9), going to (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nThen from (9,4), I can go left to (5,4), then up to (5,5) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), so from (9,4), to (5,5): |9-5| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 14 + 5 = 19 steps.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best path.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (4,0), and it's just the head, no body.\n\nI need to make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nI don't know how the enemy snake will move, so I should assume it could move in any direction.\n\nBut for now, I'll plan my path assuming it stays put or moves in a way that doesn't block me.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to predict its movement based on the apple positions.\n\nBut perhaps that's too complicated for now.\n\nI need to make a decision for my next move.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by moving down towards the closest apple at (0,2).\n\nFrom (0,9), moving down to (0,2) is a straight path with no obstacles.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move down.\n\nBut wait, I need to specify left, right, up, or down.\n\nIn terms of coordinates:\n\n- Down corresponds to decreasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Up corresponds to increasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Left corresponds to decreasing x-coordinate.\n\n- Right corresponds to increasing x-coordinate.\n\nSo, to move down from (0,9) to (0,8), I should choose down.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, my next"

There are five apples on the board: at (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), and (7,1). There's also an enemy snake at (4,0).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (0,2), which is straight down from my current position. Let's calculate the distance: from (0,9) to (0,2), that's a vertical move down by 7 steps. There don't seem to be any obstacles in that path, so that might be a safe starting point.\n\nBut I also need to think about what to do after eating that apple. After eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have a path that allows me to extend without bumping into myself.\n\nLet me consider the positions after eating (0,2). Once I eat it, my tail will extend, so I need to plan my moves carefully to avoid my own body.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), perhaps I can move right towards the apples at (7,1) and (8,1). From (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1) to eat another apple, and then to (8,1) for the third apple. That seems like a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (5,5) after (0,2). From (0,2), I can move right to (5,2), then up to (5,5). That's another option.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake at (4,0). I don't know how it will move, so I should assume it could potentially block some paths. For now, I'll plan my path away from it initially and see.\n\nLet me also look at the other apples. The apple at (9,4) is quite far away, requiring a move down to (0,4) and then right to (9,4), which is a long path and might not be efficient in the short term.\n\nSimilarly, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are in the lower right area. If I can pick up multiple apples in that area after getting (0,2), that would be ideal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for (0,2), then (7,1), then (8,1). Let's map that out.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 7 + 7 + 1 + 1 = 16 steps.\n\nThat seems manageable. Now, after eating three apples, my snake would be quite long, so I need to ensure that the path doesn't loop back on itself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (0,2), then up to (0,5), then right to (5,5) to get the apple there. But that seems less efficient because (5,5) is farther than (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nWait, from (0,2), moving up to (0,5) is actually moving up 3 steps, then right to (5,5), which is 5 steps right. That's 3 + 5 = 8 steps after the initial 7 steps to (0,2), totaling 15 steps for three apples. Hmm, that might be better.\n\nBut let's see: (0,2) to (0,5): up 3, then right to (5,5): 5 steps. That's a total of 7 + 3 + 5 = 15 steps.\n\nCompared to the previous path of 16 steps, this is shorter. However, I need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board, from (0,2) up to (0,5), then right to (5,5). It seems clear, but I need to make sure that I won't be bumping into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,5), I could then head over to (9,4). From (5,5), right to (9,5), then down to (9,4). That's 4 steps right and 1 step down, totaling 5 steps.\n\nSo, overall steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 3 (up to 0,5) + 5 (right to 5,5) + 4 (right to 9,5) + 1 (down to 9,4) = 7 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 20 steps.\n\nBut wait, after eating (5,5), my snake is longer, so I need to ensure that I can make these moves without hitting my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (5,5), I can go directly down to (5,4), then right to (9,4). That's 1 step down and 4 steps right, totaling 5 steps.\n\nOverall steps: 7 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 4 = still 20 steps.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nLet me consider going for (0,2), then directly to (9,4). From (0,2), right to (9,2), then down to (9,4). That's 9 steps right and 2 steps down, totaling 11 steps after the initial 7 steps, for a total of 18 steps.\n\nBut in this path, I would miss the apples at (7,1) and (8,1), which might not be optimal in terms of points, but it's faster in terms of steps.\n\nI need to balance between maximizing points and minimizing risk.\n\nAlso, I should consider that the enemy snake might be moving and potentially blocking my path.\n\nBut since I don't know its movement pattern, I'll have to plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for the apples that are closer together first, to minimize movement steps and maximize points.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent, so picking them up in sequence would be efficient.\n\nTo reach (7,1), from (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,1): 7 steps.\n\nTotal: 15 steps.\n\nThen, from (7,1), right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 16 steps for two apples.\n\nComparing to the previous path of 18 steps for two apples, this seems better.\n\nAfter that, I can head to (0,2), but that's now at (0,2), which is up left from (8,1). That would require:\n\n- Left to (8,2): 1 step.\n\n- Up to (8,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Left to (0,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\nThat's 1 + 8 + 8 + 7 = 24 steps, which is a lot.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), I could go up to (8,4), then right to (9,4) to get the apple there.\n\nFrom (8,1), up to (8,4): 3 steps.\n\nThen right to (9,4): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 15 (to 7,1) + 1 (to 8,1) + 3 (up to 8,4) + 1 (right to 9,4) = 20 steps for four apples.\n\nThen, finally, go to (5,5). From (9,4), left to (5,4): 4 steps.\n\nThen up to (5,5): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 20 + 4 + 1 = 25 steps for five apples.\n\nThis seems like a possible strategy.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself in these maneuvers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by going for (0,2), then (7,1), (8,1), (9,4), and finally (5,5).\n\nWait, but to get from (8,1) to (9,4), it's right to (9,1), then up to (9,4): 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n\nSo, total steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 7 (right to 7,2) + 1 (down to 7,1) + 1 (right to 8,1) + 1 (right to 9,1) + 3 (up to 9,4) + left to (5,4) + up to (5,5).\n\nWait, that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I need to sketch this out.\n\nLet's try to plan a path:\n\nStart at (0,9).\n\n1. Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n2. Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n3. Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n4. Right to (8,1):"

I should plan paths that don't lead me directly into its area, especially since I don't know its direction.\n\nOption 1: Go for (0,2) first.\n\nFrom (1,9):\n\n- Move left to (0,9)\n\n- Move down to (0,2)\n\nThat's 1 left + 7 downs: total 8 moves.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure the next moves don't hit my own tail.\n\nThen, from (0,2), I can aim for other apples.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (5,5) is at (5,5)\n\n- (7,1) is at (7,1)\n\n- (8,1) is at (8,1)\n\n- (9,4) is at (9,4)\n\nFrom (0,2), the closest apple is (5,5):\n\n- |0-5| + |2-5| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\nAlternatively, (7,1):\n\n- |0-7| + |2-1| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n(8,1):\n\n- |0-8| + |2-1| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n(9,4):\n\n- |0-9| + |2-4| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\nSo, (5,5) and (7,1) are equally close from (0,2).\n\nLet's consider going to (5,5) first.\n\nFrom (0,2):\n\n- Right to (5,2): 5 steps\n\n- Up to (5,5): 3 steps\n\nTotal: 5 + 3 = 8 steps\n\nThen, from (5,5), let's see the next closest apple.\n\nApples left: (7,1), (8,1), (9,4)\n\nFrom (5,5):\n\n- (7,1): |5-7| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- (8,1): |5-8| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, (9,4) is the closest from (5,5).\n\nFrom (5,5):\n\n- Right to (9,5): 4 steps\n\n- Down to (9,4): 1 step\n\nTotal: 4 + 1 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (9,4), the remaining apples are (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nFrom (9,4):\n\n- Left to (7,4): 2 steps\n\n- Down to (7,1): 3 steps\n\nTotal: 2 + 3 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (7,1), right to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 1 step\n\nSo, overall steps:\n\n- (1,9) to (0,2): 8 steps\n\n- (0,2) to (5,5): 8 steps\n\n- (5,5) to (9,4): 5 steps\n\n- (9,4) to (7,1): 5 steps\n\n- (7,1) to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal steps: 8 + 8 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 27 steps\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path doesn't cause my snake to collide with itself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider going for (5,5) first.\n\nFrom (1,9):\n\n- Down to (1,5): 4 steps\n\n- Right to (5,5): 4 steps\n\nTotal: 4 + 4 = 8 steps\n\nThen, from (5,5):\n\n- Right to (9,5): 4 steps\n\n- Down to (9,4): 1 step\n\nTotal: 4 + 1 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (9,4):\n\n- Left to (7,4): 2 steps\n\n- Down to (7,1): 3 steps\n\nTotal: 2 + 3 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (7,1):\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 1 step\n\nSo, total steps:\n\n- (1,9) to (5,5): 8 steps\n\n- (5,5) to (9,4): 5 steps\n\n- (9,4) to (7,1): 5 steps\n\n- (7,1) to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 8 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 19 steps\n\nThis seems more efficient than the previous path.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1). If I can avoid that area, especially while the enemy might be moving, it's better.\n\nIn this path, I'm going down to (1,5), then right to (5,5), then right to (9,5), down to (9,4), left to (7,4), down to (7,1), and right to (8,1).\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), which is below my path mostly, so as long as I don't go directly into its position, I should be fine.\n\nBut I need to be cautious, especially when moving down.\n\nAlso, after eating each apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me back to my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Start at (1,9)\n\n2. Down to (1,5)\n\n3. Right to (5,5)\n\n4. Right to (9,5)\n\n5. Down to (9,4)\n\n6. Left to (7,4)\n\n7. Down to (7,1)\n\n8. Right to (8,1)\n\nAt each step, after eating an apple, my tail extends.\n\nI need to ensure that the next move doesn't step on the new tail positions.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,5), my tail will have grown, so I need to make sure that moving right to (9,5) doesn't cause me to run into my own tail.\n\nSimilarly, after eating (9,4), moving left to (7,4) should be safe, provided I have a long enough path without hitting myself.\n\nThis seems manageable, but I need to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apples that are closer together first to minimize movement.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent, so picking them up in sequence would be efficient.\n\nFrom (1,9):\n\n- Down to (1,1): 8 steps\n\n- Right to (8,1): 7 steps\n\nTotal: 8 + 7 = 15 steps to (8,1)\n\nThen, left to (7,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 1 step\n\nThen"

Let me confirm: coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. So (0,9) is indeed the top-left.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: 2 (me) and some dots.\n\nRow 8: All dots.\n\nRow 7: All dots.\n\nRow 6: All dots.\n\nRow 5: An apple at (5,5).\n\nRow 4: An apple at (9,4).\n\nRow 3: All dots.\n\nRow 2: An apple at (0,2).\n\nRow 1: Apples at (8,1) and (7,1).\n\nRow 0: An apple at (4,0) and snake 1 at (4,0).\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,0), which is also where there's an apple. Does that mean snake 1 is on top of the apple, or is the apple still there? The board shows a '1' and an 'A' at (4,0), but maybe the '1' is the snake and 'A' is the apple. Hmm, that might be confusing.\n\nAlso, snake 1 has an empty body list, so it's just the head at (4,0). Me too, since I don't see any body parts listed for me.\n\nSo, my position: (0,9)\n\nApples at: (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), (7,1)\n\nEnemy snake at: (4,0)\n\nI need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential risks.\n\nLet me calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (0,9):\n\n1. (0,2): Distance is |0-0| + |9-2| = 0 + 7 = 7 steps.\n\n2. (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\n3. (8,1): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16 steps.\n\n4. (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\n5. (7,1): |0-7| + |9-1| = 7 + 8 = 15 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (0,2), 7 steps away.\n\nBut I should also consider the path to each apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet's visualize the grid:\n\nColumns 0 to 9, rows 0 to 9.\n\nMy position: (0,9)\n\nApple at (0,2): straight down, no obstacles seen in between.\n\nWait, but looking at the board state, row 2 has an 'A' at (0,2). From (0,9) to (0,2), that's moving down 7 rows.\n\nIs there any part of my body in the way? No, since I just started, I only have the head.\n\nSimilarly, is there any other snake in the way? Snake 1 is at (4,0), which is lower right.\n\nSo, path to (0,2): move down 7 steps.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider eating multiple apples in one go.\n\nLet me see: if I go to (0,2), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving right would take me towards (7,1) and (8,1), which are lower down.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up to (9,4), but that's farther.\n\nAlternatively, (5,5) is also an option.\n\nLet me think about a sequence.\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Go to (0,2): 7 steps down.\n\n2. After eating (0,2), I'm longer, so I need to be careful.\n\n3. From (0,2), I can move right to (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (7,1) is 7 steps right and 1 step down.\n\nWait, (7,1) is at column 7, row 1.\n\nFrom (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\nSo, from (0,2):\n\n- Move right 7 steps to (7,2)\n\n- Then down 1 step to (7,1)\n\n- Eat apple at (7,1)\n\n- Now, move right 1 step to (8,1) to eat another apple.\n\nTotal steps from start: 7 (down) + 7 (right) + 1 (down) + 1 (right) = 16 steps.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nOption 2:\n\nGo directly to (5,5):\n\nFrom (0,9) to (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nBut wait, in option 1, it was 16 steps for three apples, while option 2 is 14 steps for two apples.\n\nBut in option 1, I can potentially get three apples in 16 steps, while in option 2, only two in 14 steps.\n\nNot sure, need to think carefully.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Each time I eat an apple, my tail grows.\n\nSo, after eating (0,2), my tail will be longer, and I need to make sure I don't bump into it when making turns.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apples that are closer to each other first.\n\nLooking at the board, apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent.\n\nSo, maybe go to (7,1), eat it, then go to (8,1), eat it, then proceed to another apple.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps\n\n- Then right to (7,1): 7 steps\n\n- Eat (7,1)\n\n- Then right to (8,1): 1 step\n\n- Eat (8,1)\n\n- Now, where to next? (0,2), (5,5), or (9,4).\n\nFrom (8,1), to (5,5): |8-5| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps.\n\nTotal steps so far: 8 + 7 + 1 + 7 = 23 steps.\n\nThat seems too many.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), go up to (8,9), then left to (0,9), then down to (0,2), etc.\n\nBut that would be a very long detour.\n\nMaybe not efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (9,4).\n\nFrom (0,9), going to (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nThen from (9,4), I can go left to (5,4), then up to (5,5) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), so from (9,4), to (5,5): |9-5| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 14 + 5 = 19 steps.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best path.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (4,0), and it's just the head, no body.\n\nI need to make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nI don't know how the enemy snake will move, so I should assume it could move in any direction.\n\nBut for now, I'll plan my path assuming it stays put or moves in a way that doesn't block me.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to predict its movement based on the apple positions.\n\nBut perhaps that's too complicated for now.\n\nI need to make a decision for my next move.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by moving down towards the closest apple at (0,2).\n\nFrom (0,9), moving down to (0,2) is a straight path with no obstacles.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move down.\n\nBut wait, I need to specify left, right, up, or down.\n\nIn terms of coordinates:\n\n- Down corresponds to decreasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Up corresponds to increasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Left corresponds to decreasing x-coordinate.\n\n- Right corresponds to increasing x-coordinate.\n\nSo, to move down from (0,9) to (0,8), I should choose down.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, my next"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. So, I'm currently at position (0,9), which is the top-left corner of the board. There are five apples on the board: at (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), and (7,1). There's also an enemy snake at (4,0).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (0,2), which is straight down from my current position. Let's calculate the distance: from (0,9) to (0,2), that's a vertical move down by 7 steps. There don't seem to be any obstacles in that path, so that might be a safe starting point.\n\nBut I also need to think about what to do after eating that apple. After eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have a path that allows me to extend without bumping into myself.\n\nLet me consider the positions after eating (0,2). Once I eat it, my tail will extend, so I need to plan my moves carefully to avoid my own body.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), perhaps I can move right towards the apples at (7,1) and (8,1). From (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1) to eat another apple, and then to (8,1) for the third apple. That seems like a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (5,5) after (0,2). From (0,2), I can move right to (5,2), then up to (5,5). That's another option.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake at (4,0). I don't know how it will move, so I should assume it could potentially block some paths. For now, I'll plan my path away from it initially and see.\n\nLet me also look at the other apples. The apple at (9,4) is quite far away, requiring a move down to (0,4) and then right to (9,4), which is a long path and might not be efficient in the short term.\n\nSimilarly, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are in the lower right area. If I can pick up multiple apples in that area after getting (0,2), that would be ideal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for (0,2), then (7,1), then (8,1). Let's map that out.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 7 + 7 + 1 + 1 = 16 steps.\n\nThat seems manageable. Now, after eating three apples, my snake would be quite long, so I need to ensure that the path doesn't loop back on itself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (0,2), then up to (0,5), then right to (5,5) to get the apple there. But that seems less efficient because (5,5) is farther than (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nWait, from (0,2), moving up to (0,5) is actually moving up 3 steps, then right to (5,5), which is 5 steps right. That's 3 + 5 = 8 steps after the initial 7 steps to (0,2), totaling 15 steps for three apples. Hmm, that might be better.\n\nBut let's see: (0,2) to (0,5): up 3, then right to (5,5): 5 steps. That's a total of 7 + 3 + 5 = 15 steps.\n\nCompared to the previous path of 16 steps, this is shorter. However, I need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board, from (0,2) up to (0,5), then right to (5,5). It seems clear, but I need to make sure that I won't be bumping into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,5), I could then head over to (9,4). From (5,5), right to (9,5), then down to (9,4). That's 4 steps right and 1 step down, totaling 5 steps.\n\nSo, overall steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 3 (up to 0,5) + 5 (right to 5,5) + 4 (right to 9,5) + 1 (down to 9,4) = 7 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 20 steps.\n\nBut wait, after eating (5,5), my snake is longer, so I need to ensure that I can make these moves without hitting my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (5,5), I can go directly down to (5,4), then right to (9,4). That's 1 step down and 4 steps right, totaling 5 steps.\n\nOverall steps: 7 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 4 = still 20 steps.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nLet me consider going for (0,2), then directly to (9,4). From (0,2), right to (9,2), then down to (9,4). That's 9 steps right and 2 steps down, totaling 11 steps after the initial 7 steps, for a total of 18 steps.\n\nBut in this path, I would miss the apples at (7,1) and (8,1), which might not be optimal in terms of points, but it's faster in terms of steps.\n\nI need to balance between maximizing points and minimizing risk.\n\nAlso, I should consider that the enemy snake might be moving and potentially blocking my path.\n\nBut since I don't know its movement pattern, I'll have to plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for the apples that are closer together first, to minimize movement steps and maximize points.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent, so picking them up in sequence would be efficient.\n\nTo reach (7,1), from (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,1): 7 steps.\n\nTotal: 15 steps.\n\nThen, from (7,1), right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 16 steps for two apples.\n\nComparing to the previous path of 18 steps for two apples, this seems better.\n\nAfter that, I can head to (0,2), but that's now at (0,2), which is up left from (8,1). That would require:\n\n- Left to (8,2): 1 step.\n\n- Up to (8,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Left to (0,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\nThat's 1 + 8 + 8 + 7 = 24 steps, which is a lot.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), I could go up to (8,4), then right to (9,4) to get the apple there.\n\nFrom (8,1), up to (8,4): 3 steps.\n\nThen right to (9,4): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 15 (to 7,1) + 1 (to 8,1) + 3 (up to 8,4) + 1 (right to 9,4) = 20 steps for four apples.\n\nThen, finally, go to (5,5). From (9,4), left to (5,4): 4 steps.\n\nThen up to (5,5): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 20 + 4 + 1 = 25 steps for five apples.\n\nThis seems like a possible strategy.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself in these maneuvers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by going for (0,2), then (7,1), (8,1), (9,4), and finally (5,5).\n\nWait, but to get from (8,1) to (9,4), it's right to (9,1), then up to (9,4): 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n\nSo, total steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 7 (right to 7,2) + 1 (down to 7,1) + 1 (right to 8,1) + 1 (right to 9,1) + 3 (up to 9,4) + left to (5,4) + up to (5,5).\n\nWait, that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I need to sketch this out.\n\nLet's try to plan a path:\n\nStart at (0,9).\n\n1. Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n2. Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n3. Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n4. Right to (8,1):"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (0,9). That's the top-left corner, right? Let me confirm: coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. So (0,9) is indeed the top-left.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: 2 (me) and some dots.\n\nRow 8: All dots.\n\nRow 7: All dots.\n\nRow 6: All dots.\n\nRow 5: An apple at (5,5).\n\nRow 4: An apple at (9,4).\n\nRow 3: All dots.\n\nRow 2: An apple at (0,2).\n\nRow 1: Apples at (8,1) and (7,1).\n\nRow 0: An apple at (4,0) and snake 1 at (4,0).\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,0), which is also where there's an apple. Does that mean snake 1 is on top of the apple, or is the apple still there? The board shows a '1' and an 'A' at (4,0), but maybe the '1' is the snake and 'A' is the apple. Hmm, that might be confusing.\n\nAlso, snake 1 has an empty body list, so it's just the head at (4,0). Me too, since I don't see any body parts listed for me.\n\nSo, my position: (0,9)\n\nApples at: (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), (7,1)\n\nEnemy snake at: (4,0)\n\nI need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential risks.\n\nLet me calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (0,9):\n\n1. (0,2): Distance is |0-0| + |9-2| = 0 + 7 = 7 steps.\n\n2. (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\n3. (8,1): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16 steps.\n\n4. (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\n5. (7,1): |0-7| + |9-1| = 7 + 8 = 15 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (0,2), 7 steps away.\n\nBut I should also consider the path to each apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet's visualize the grid:\n\nColumns 0 to 9, rows 0 to 9.\n\nMy position: (0,9)\n\nApple at (0,2): straight down, no obstacles seen in between.\n\nWait, but looking at the board state, row 2 has an 'A' at (0,2). From (0,9) to (0,2), that's moving down 7 rows.\n\nIs there any part of my body in the way? No, since I just started, I only have the head.\n\nSimilarly, is there any other snake in the way? Snake 1 is at (4,0), which is lower right.\n\nSo, path to (0,2): move down 7 steps.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider eating multiple apples in one go.\n\nLet me see: if I go to (0,2), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving right would take me towards (7,1) and (8,1), which are lower down.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up to (9,4), but that's farther.\n\nAlternatively, (5,5) is also an option.\n\nLet me think about a sequence.\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Go to (0,2): 7 steps down.\n\n2. After eating (0,2), I'm longer, so I need to be careful.\n\n3. From (0,2), I can move right to (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (7,1) is 7 steps right and 1 step down.\n\nWait, (7,1) is at column 7, row 1.\n\nFrom (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\nSo, from (0,2):\n\n- Move right 7 steps to (7,2)\n\n- Then down 1 step to (7,1)\n\n- Eat apple at (7,1)\n\n- Now, move right 1 step to (8,1) to eat another apple.\n\nTotal steps from start: 7 (down) + 7 (right) + 1 (down) + 1 (right) = 16 steps.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nOption 2:\n\nGo directly to (5,5):\n\nFrom (0,9) to (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nBut wait, in option 1, it was 16 steps for three apples, while option 2 is 14 steps for two apples.\n\nBut in option 1, I can potentially get three apples in 16 steps, while in option 2, only two in 14 steps.\n\nNot sure, need to think carefully.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Each time I eat an apple, my tail grows.\n\nSo, after eating (0,2), my tail will be longer, and I need to make sure I don't bump into it when making turns.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apples that are closer to each other first.\n\nLooking at the board, apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent.\n\nSo, maybe go to (7,1), eat it, then go to (8,1), eat it, then proceed to another apple.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps\n\n- Then right to (7,1): 7 steps\n\n- Eat (7,1)\n\n- Then right to (8,1): 1 step\n\n- Eat (8,1)\n\n- Now, where to next?

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. So, I'm currently at position (0,9), which is the top-left corner of the board. There are five apples on the board: at (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), and (7,1). There's also an enemy snake at (4,0).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (0,2), which is straight down from my current position. Let's calculate the distance: from (0,9) to (0,2), that's a vertical move down by 7 steps. There don't seem to be any obstacles in that path, so that might be a safe starting point.\n\nBut I also need to think about what to do after eating that apple. After eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have a path that allows me to extend without bumping into myself.\n\nLet me consider the positions after eating (0,2). Once I eat it, my tail will extend, so I need to plan my moves carefully to avoid my own body.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), perhaps I can move right towards the apples at (7,1) and (8,1). From (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1) to eat another apple, and then to (8,1) for the third apple. That seems like a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (5,5) after (0,2). From (0,2), I can move right to (5,2), then up to (5,5). That's another option.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake at (4,0). I don't know how it will move, so I should assume it could potentially block some paths. For now, I'll plan my path away from it initially and see.\n\nLet me also look at the other apples. The apple at (9,4) is quite far away, requiring a move down to (0,4) and then right to (9,4), which is a long path and might not be efficient in the short term.\n\nSimilarly, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are in the lower right area. If I can pick up multiple apples in that area after getting (0,2), that would be ideal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for (0,2), then (7,1), then (8,1). Let's map that out.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 7 + 7 + 1 + 1 = 16 steps.\n\nThat seems manageable. Now, after eating three apples, my snake would be quite long, so I need to ensure that the path doesn't loop back on itself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (0,2), then up to (0,5), then right to (5,5) to get the apple there. But that seems less efficient because (5,5) is farther than (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nWait, from (0,2), moving up to (0,5) is actually moving up 3 steps, then right to (5,5), which is 5 steps right. That's 3 + 5 = 8 steps after the initial 7 steps to (0,2), totaling 15 steps for three apples. Hmm, that might be better.\n\nBut let's see: (0,2) to (0,5): up 3, then right to (5,5): 5 steps. That's a total of 7 + 3 + 5 = 15 steps.\n\nCompared to the previous path of 16 steps, this is shorter. However, I need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board, from (0,2) up to (0,5), then right to (5,5). It seems clear, but I need to make sure that I won't be bumping into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,5), I could then head over to (9,4). From (5,5), right to (9,5), then down to (9,4). That's 4 steps right and 1 step down, totaling 5 steps.\n\nSo, overall steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 3 (up to 0,5) + 5 (right to 5,5) + 4 (right to 9,5) + 1 (down to 9,4) = 7 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 20 steps.\n\nBut wait, after eating (5,5), my snake is longer, so I need to ensure that I can make these moves without hitting my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (5,5), I can go directly down to (5,4), then right to (9,4). That's 1 step down and 4 steps right, totaling 5 steps.\n\nOverall steps: 7 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 4 = still 20 steps.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nLet me consider going for (0,2), then directly to (9,4). From (0,2), right to (9,2), then down to (9,4). That's 9 steps right and 2 steps down, totaling 11 steps after the initial 7 steps, for a total of 18 steps.\n\nBut in this path, I would miss the apples at (7,1) and (8,1), which might not be optimal in terms of points, but it's faster in terms of steps.\n\nI need to balance between maximizing points and minimizing risk.\n\nAlso, I should consider that the enemy snake might be moving and potentially blocking my path.\n\nBut since I don't know its movement pattern, I'll have to plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for the apples that are closer together first, to minimize movement steps and maximize points.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent, so picking them up in sequence would be efficient.\n\nTo reach (7,1), from (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,1): 7 steps.\n\nTotal: 15 steps.\n\nThen, from (7,1), right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 16 steps for two apples.\n\nComparing to the previous path of 18 steps for two apples, this seems better.\n\nAfter that, I can head to (0,2), but that's now at (0,2), which is up left from (8,1). That would require:\n\n- Left to (8,2): 1 step.\n\n- Up to (8,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Left to (0,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\nThat's 1 + 8 + 8 + 7 = 24 steps, which is a lot.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), I could go up to (8,4), then right to (9,4) to get the apple there.\n\nFrom (8,1), up to (8,4): 3 steps.\n\nThen right to (9,4): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 15 (to 7,1) + 1 (to 8,1) + 3 (up to 8,4) + 1 (right to 9,4) = 20 steps for four apples.\n\nThen, finally, go to (5,5). From (9,4), left to (5,4): 4 steps.\n\nThen up to (5,5): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 20 + 4 + 1 = 25 steps for five apples.\n\nThis seems like a possible strategy.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself in these maneuvers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by going for (0,2), then (7,1), (8,1), (9,4), and finally (5,5).\n\nWait, but to get from (8,1) to (9,4), it's right to (9,1), then up to (9,4): 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n\nSo, total steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 7 (right to 7,2) + 1 (down to 7,1) + 1 (right to 8,1) + 1 (right to 9,1) + 3 (up to 9,4) + left to (5,4) + up to (5,5).\n\nWait, that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I need to sketch this out.\n\nLet's try to plan a path:\n\nStart at (0,9).\n\n1. Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n2. Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n3. Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n4. Right to (8,1):"

I should plan paths that don't lead me directly into its area, especially since I don't know its direction.\n\nOption 1: Go for (0,2) first.\n\nFrom (1,9):\n\n- Move left to (0,9)\n\n- Move down to (0,2)\n\nThat's 1 left + 7 downs: total 8 moves.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure the next moves don't hit my own tail.\n\nThen, from (0,2), I can aim for other apples.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (5,5) is at (5,5)\n\n- (7,1) is at (7,1)\n\n- (8,1) is at (8,1)\n\n- (9,4) is at (9,4)\n\nFrom (0,2), the closest apple is (5,5):\n\n- |0-5| + |2-5| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\nAlternatively, (7,1):\n\n- |0-7| + |2-1| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n(8,1):\n\n- |0-8| + |2-1| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n(9,4):\n\n- |0-9| + |2-4| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\nSo, (5,5) and (7,1) are equally close from (0,2).\n\nLet's consider going to (5,5) first.\n\nFrom (0,2):\n\n- Right to (5,2): 5 steps\n\n- Up to (5,5): 3 steps\n\nTotal: 5 + 3 = 8 steps\n\nThen, from (5,5), let's see the next closest apple.\n\nApples left: (7,1), (8,1), (9,4)\n\nFrom (5,5):\n\n- (7,1): |5-7| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- (8,1): |5-8| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, (9,4) is the closest from (5,5).\n\nFrom (5,5):\n\n- Right to (9,5): 4 steps\n\n- Down to (9,4): 1 step\n\nTotal: 4 + 1 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (9,4), the remaining apples are (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nFrom (9,4):\n\n- Left to (7,4): 2 steps\n\n- Down to (7,1): 3 steps\n\nTotal: 2 + 3 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (7,1), right to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 1 step\n\nSo, overall steps:\n\n- (1,9) to (0,2): 8 steps\n\n- (0,2) to (5,5): 8 steps\n\n- (5,5) to (9,4): 5 steps\n\n- (9,4) to (7,1): 5 steps\n\n- (7,1) to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal steps: 8 + 8 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 27 steps\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path doesn't cause my snake to collide with itself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider going for (5,5) first.\n\nFrom (1,9):\n\n- Down to (1,5): 4 steps\n\n- Right to (5,5): 4 steps\n\nTotal: 4 + 4 = 8 steps\n\nThen, from (5,5):\n\n- Right to (9,5): 4 steps\n\n- Down to (9,4): 1 step\n\nTotal: 4 + 1 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (9,4):\n\n- Left to (7,4): 2 steps\n\n- Down to (7,1): 3 steps\n\nTotal: 2 + 3 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (7,1):\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 1 step\n\nSo, total steps:\n\n- (1,9) to (5,5): 8 steps\n\n- (5,5) to (9,4): 5 steps\n\n- (9,4) to (7,1): 5 steps\n\n- (7,1) to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 8 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 19 steps\n\nThis seems more efficient than the previous path.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1). If I can avoid that area, especially while the enemy might be moving, it's better.\n\nIn this path, I'm going down to (1,5), then right to (5,5), then right to (9,5), down to (9,4), left to (7,4), down to (7,1), and right to (8,1).\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), which is below my path mostly, so as long as I don't go directly into its position, I should be fine.\n\nBut I need to be cautious, especially when moving down.\n\nAlso, after eating each apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me back to my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Start at (1,9)\n\n2. Down to (1,5)\n\n3. Right to (5,5)\n\n4. Right to (9,5)\n\n5. Down to (9,4)\n\n6. Left to (7,4)\n\n7. Down to (7,1)\n\n8. Right to (8,1)\n\nAt each step, after eating an apple, my tail extends.\n\nI need to ensure that the next move doesn't step on the new tail positions.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,5), my tail will have grown, so I need to make sure that moving right to (9,5) doesn't cause me to run into my own tail.\n\nSimilarly, after eating (9,4), moving left to (7,4) should be safe, provided I have a long enough path without hitting myself.\n\nThis seems manageable, but I need to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apples that are closer together first to minimize movement.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent, so picking them up in sequence would be efficient.\n\nFrom (1,9):\n\n- Down to (1,1): 8 steps\n\n- Right to (8,1): 7 steps\n\nTotal: 8 + 7 = 15 steps to (8,1)\n\nThen, left to (7,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 1 step\n\nThen"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (0,9). That's the top-left corner, right? Let me confirm: coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. So (0,9) is indeed the top-left.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: 2 (me) and some dots.\n\nRow 8: All dots.\n\nRow 7: All dots.\n\nRow 6: All dots.\n\nRow 5: An apple at (5,5).\n\nRow 4: An apple at (9,4).\n\nRow 3: All dots.\n\nRow 2: An apple at (0,2).\n\nRow 1: Apples at (8,1) and (7,1).\n\nRow 0: An apple at (4,0) and snake 1 at (4,0).\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,0), which is also where there's an apple. Does that mean snake 1 is on top of the apple, or is the apple still there? The board shows a '1' and an 'A' at (4,0), but maybe the '1' is the snake and 'A' is the apple. Hmm, that might be confusing.\n\nAlso, snake 1 has an empty body list, so it's just the head at (4,0). Me too, since I don't see any body parts listed for me.\n\nSo, my position: (0,9)\n\nApples at: (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), (7,1)\n\nEnemy snake at: (4,0)\n\nI need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential risks.\n\nLet me calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (0,9):\n\n1. (0,2): Distance is |0-0| + |9-2| = 0 + 7 = 7 steps.\n\n2. (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\n3. (8,1): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16 steps.\n\n4. (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\n5. (7,1): |0-7| + |9-1| = 7 + 8 = 15 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (0,2), 7 steps away.\n\nBut I should also consider the path to each apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet's visualize the grid:\n\nColumns 0 to 9, rows 0 to 9.\n\nMy position: (0,9)\n\nApple at (0,2): straight down, no obstacles seen in between.\n\nWait, but looking at the board state, row 2 has an 'A' at (0,2). From (0,9) to (0,2), that's moving down 7 rows.\n\nIs there any part of my body in the way? No, since I just started, I only have the head.\n\nSimilarly, is there any other snake in the way? Snake 1 is at (4,0), which is lower right.\n\nSo, path to (0,2): move down 7 steps.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider eating multiple apples in one go.\n\nLet me see: if I go to (0,2), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving right would take me towards (7,1) and (8,1), which are lower down.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up to (9,4), but that's farther.\n\nAlternatively, (5,5) is also an option.\n\nLet me think about a sequence.\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Go to (0,2): 7 steps down.\n\n2. After eating (0,2), I'm longer, so I need to be careful.\n\n3. From (0,2), I can move right to (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (7,1) is 7 steps right and 1 step down.\n\nWait, (7,1) is at column 7, row 1.\n\nFrom (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\nSo, from (0,2):\n\n- Move right 7 steps to (7,2)\n\n- Then down 1 step to (7,1)\n\n- Eat apple at (7,1)\n\n- Now, move right 1 step to (8,1) to eat another apple.\n\nTotal steps from start: 7 (down) + 7 (right) + 1 (down) + 1 (right) = 16 steps.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nOption 2:\n\nGo directly to (5,5):\n\nFrom (0,9) to (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nBut wait, in option 1, it was 16 steps for three apples, while option 2 is 14 steps for two apples.\n\nBut in option 1, I can potentially get three apples in 16 steps, while in option 2, only two in 14 steps.\n\nNot sure, need to think carefully.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Each time I eat an apple, my tail grows.\n\nSo, after eating (0,2), my tail will be longer, and I need to make sure I don't bump into it when making turns.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apples that are closer to each other first.\n\nLooking at the board, apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent.\n\nSo, maybe go to (7,1), eat it, then go to (8,1), eat it, then proceed to another apple.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps\n\n- Then right to (7,1): 7 steps\n\n- Eat (7,1)\n\n- Then right to (8,1): 1 step\n\n- Eat (8,1)\n\n- Now, where to next? (0,2), (5,5), or (9,4).\n\nFrom (8,1), to (5,5): |8-5| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps.\n\nTotal steps so far: 8 + 7 + 1 + 7 = 23 steps.\n\nThat seems too many.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), go up to (8,9), then left to (0,9), then down to (0,2), etc.\n\nBut that would be a very long detour.\n\nMaybe not efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (9,4).\n\nFrom (0,9), going to (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nThen from (9,4), I can go left to (5,4), then up to (5,5) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), so from (9,4), to (5,5): |9-5| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 14 + 5 = 19 steps.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best path.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (4,0), and it's just the head, no body.\n\nI need to make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nI don't know how the enemy snake will move, so I should assume it could move in any direction.\n\nBut for now, I'll plan my path assuming it stays put or moves in a way that doesn't block me.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to predict its movement based on the apple positions.\n\nBut perhaps that's too complicated for now.\n\nI need to make a decision for my next move.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by moving down towards the closest apple at (0,2).\n\nFrom (0,9), moving down to (0,2) is a straight path with no obstacles.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move down.\n\nBut wait, I need to specify left, right, up, or down.\n\nIn terms of coordinates:\n\n- Down corresponds to decreasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Up corresponds to increasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Left corresponds to decreasing x-coordinate.\n\n- Right corresponds to increasing x-coordinate.\n\nSo, to move down from (0,9) to (0,8), I should choose down.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, my next"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. So, I'm currently at position (0,9), which is the top-left corner of the board. There are five apples on the board: at (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), and (7,1). There's also an enemy snake at (4,0).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (0,2), which is straight down from my current position. Let's calculate the distance: from (0,9) to (0,2), that's a vertical move down by 7 steps. There don't seem to be any obstacles in that path, so that might be a safe starting point.\n\nBut I also need to think about what to do after eating that apple. After eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have a path that allows me to extend without bumping into myself.\n\nLet me consider the positions after eating (0,2). Once I eat it, my tail will extend, so I need to plan my moves carefully to avoid my own body.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), perhaps I can move right towards the apples at (7,1) and (8,1). From (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1) to eat another apple, and then to (8,1) for the third apple. That seems like a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (5,5) after (0,2). From (0,2), I can move right to (5,2), then up to (5,5). That's another option.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake at (4,0). I don't know how it will move, so I should assume it could potentially block some paths. For now, I'll plan my path away from it initially and see.\n\nLet me also look at the other apples. The apple at (9,4) is quite far away, requiring a move down to (0,4) and then right to (9,4), which is a long path and might not be efficient in the short term.\n\nSimilarly, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are in the lower right area. If I can pick up multiple apples in that area after getting (0,2), that would be ideal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for (0,2), then (7,1), then (8,1). Let's map that out.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 7 + 7 + 1 + 1 = 16 steps.\n\nThat seems manageable. Now, after eating three apples, my snake would be quite long, so I need to ensure that the path doesn't loop back on itself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (0,2), then up to (0,5), then right to (5,5) to get the apple there. But that seems less efficient because (5,5) is farther than (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nWait, from (0,2), moving up to (0,5) is actually moving up 3 steps, then right to (5,5), which is 5 steps right. That's 3 + 5 = 8 steps after the initial 7 steps to (0,2), totaling 15 steps for three apples. Hmm, that might be better.\n\nBut let's see: (0,2) to (0,5): up 3, then right to (5,5): 5 steps. That's a total of 7 + 3 + 5 = 15 steps.\n\nCompared to the previous path of 16 steps, this is shorter. However, I need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board, from (0,2) up to (0,5), then right to (5,5). It seems clear, but I need to make sure that I won't be bumping into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,5), I could then head over to (9,4). From (5,5), right to (9,5), then down to (9,4). That's 4 steps right and 1 step down, totaling 5 steps.\n\nSo, overall steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 3 (up to 0,5) + 5 (right to 5,5) + 4 (right to 9,5) + 1 (down to 9,4) = 7 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 20 steps.\n\nBut wait, after eating (5,5), my snake is longer, so I need to ensure that I can make these moves without hitting my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (5,5), I can go directly down to (5,4), then right to (9,4). That's 1 step down and 4 steps right, totaling 5 steps.\n\nOverall steps: 7 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 4 = still 20 steps.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nLet me consider going for (0,2), then directly to (9,4). From (0,2), right to (9,2), then down to (9,4). That's 9 steps right and 2 steps down, totaling 11 steps after the initial 7 steps, for a total of 18 steps.\n\nBut in this path, I would miss the apples at (7,1) and (8,1), which might not be optimal in terms of points, but it's faster in terms of steps.\n\nI need to balance between maximizing points and minimizing risk.\n\nAlso, I should consider that the enemy snake might be moving and potentially blocking my path.\n\nBut since I don't know its movement pattern, I'll have to plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for the apples that are closer together first, to minimize movement steps and maximize points.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent, so picking them up in sequence would be efficient.\n\nTo reach (7,1), from (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,1): 7 steps.\n\nTotal: 15 steps.\n\nThen, from (7,1), right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 16 steps for two apples.\n\nComparing to the previous path of 18 steps for two apples, this seems better.\n\nAfter that, I can head to (0,2), but that's now at (0,2), which is up left from (8,1). That would require:\n\n- Left to (8,2): 1 step.\n\n- Up to (8,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Left to (0,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\nThat's 1 + 8 + 8 + 7 = 24 steps, which is a lot.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), I could go up to (8,4), then right to (9,4) to get the apple there.\n\nFrom (8,1), up to (8,4): 3 steps.\n\nThen right to (9,4): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 15 (to 7,1) + 1 (to 8,1) + 3 (up to 8,4) + 1 (right to 9,4) = 20 steps for four apples.\n\nThen, finally, go to (5,5). From (9,4), left to (5,4): 4 steps.\n\nThen up to (5,5): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 20 + 4 + 1 = 25 steps for five apples.\n\nThis seems like a possible strategy.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself in these maneuvers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by going for (0,2), then (7,1), (8,1), (9,4), and finally (5,5).\n\nWait, but to get from (8,1) to (9,4), it's right to (9,1), then up to (9,4): 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n\nSo, total steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 7 (right to 7,2) + 1 (down to 7,1) + 1 (right to 8,1) + 1 (right to 9,1) + 3 (up to 9,4) + left to (5,4) + up to (5,5).\n\nWait, that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I need to sketch this out.\n\nLet's try to plan a path:\n\nStart at (0,9).\n\n1. Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n2. Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n3. Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n4. Right to (8,1):"

I should plan paths that don't lead me directly into its area, especially since I don't know its direction.\n\nOption 1: Go for (0,2) first.\n\nFrom (1,9):\n\n- Move left to (0,9)\n\n- Move down to (0,2)\n\nThat's 1 left + 7 downs: total 8 moves.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure the next moves don't hit my own tail.\n\nThen, from (0,2), I can aim for other apples.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (5,5) is at (5,5)\n\n- (7,1) is at (7,1)\n\n- (8,1) is at (8,1)\n\n- (9,4) is at (9,4)\n\nFrom (0,2), the closest apple is (5,5):\n\n- |0-5| + |2-5| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\nAlternatively, (7,1):\n\n- |0-7| + |2-1| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n(8,1):\n\n- |0-8| + |2-1| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n(9,4):\n\n- |0-9| + |2-4| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\nSo, (5,5) and (7,1) are equally close from (0,2).\n\nLet's consider going to (5,5) first.\n\nFrom (0,2):\n\n- Right to (5,2): 5 steps\n\n- Up to (5,5): 3 steps\n\nTotal: 5 + 3 = 8 steps\n\nThen, from (5,5), let's see the next closest apple.\n\nApples left: (7,1), (8,1), (9,4)\n\nFrom (5,5):\n\n- (7,1): |5-7| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- (8,1): |5-8| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, (9,4) is the closest from (5,5).\n\nFrom (5,5):\n\n- Right to (9,5): 4 steps\n\n- Down to (9,4): 1 step\n\nTotal: 4 + 1 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (9,4), the remaining apples are (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nFrom (9,4):\n\n- Left to (7,4): 2 steps\n\n- Down to (7,1): 3 steps\n\nTotal: 2 + 3 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (7,1), right to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 1 step\n\nSo, overall steps:\n\n- (1,9) to (0,2): 8 steps\n\n- (0,2) to (5,5): 8 steps\n\n- (5,5) to (9,4): 5 steps\n\n- (9,4) to (7,1): 5 steps\n\n- (7,1) to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal steps: 8 + 8 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 27 steps\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path doesn't cause my snake to collide with itself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider going for (5,5) first.\n\nFrom (1,9):\n\n- Down to (1,5): 4 steps\n\n- Right to (5,5): 4 steps\n\nTotal: 4 + 4 = 8 steps\n\nThen, from (5,5):\n\n- Right to (9,5): 4 steps\n\n- Down to (9,4): 1 step\n\nTotal: 4 + 1 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (9,4):\n\n- Left to (7,4): 2 steps\n\n- Down to (7,1): 3 steps\n\nTotal: 2 + 3 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (7,1):\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 1 step\n\nSo, total steps:\n\n- (1,9) to (5,5): 8 steps\n\n- (5,5) to (9,4): 5 steps\n\n- (9,4) to (7,1): 5 steps\n\n- (7,1) to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 8 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 19 steps\n\nThis seems more efficient than the previous path.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1). If I can avoid that area, especially while the enemy might be moving, it's better.\n\nIn this path, I'm going down to (1,5), then right to (5,5), then right to (9,5), down to (9,4), left to (7,4), down to (7,1), and right to (8,1).\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), which is below my path mostly, so as long as I don't go directly into its position, I should be fine.\n\nBut I need to be cautious, especially when moving down.\n\nAlso, after eating each apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me back to my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Start at (1,9)\n\n2. Down to (1,5)\n\n3. Right to (5,5)\n\n4. Right to (9,5)\n\n5. Down to (9,4)\n\n6. Left to (7,4)\n\n7. Down to (7,1)\n\n8. Right to (8,1)\n\nAt each step, after eating an apple, my tail extends.\n\nI need to ensure that the next move doesn't step on the new tail positions.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,5), my tail will have grown, so I need to make sure that moving right to (9,5) doesn't cause me to run into my own tail.\n\nSimilarly, after eating (9,4), moving left to (7,4) should be safe, provided I have a long enough path without hitting myself.\n\nThis seems manageable, but I need to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apples that are closer together first to minimize movement.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent, so picking them up in sequence would be efficient.\n\nFrom (1,9):\n\n- Down to (1,1): 8 steps\n\n- Right to (8,1): 7 steps\n\nTotal: 8 + 7 = 15 steps to (8,1)\n\nThen, left to (7,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 1 step\n\nThen"

Let me confirm: coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. So (0,9) is indeed the top-left.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: 2 (me) and some dots.\n\nRow 8: All dots.\n\nRow 7: All dots.\n\nRow 6: All dots.\n\nRow 5: An apple at (5,5).\n\nRow 4: An apple at (9,4).\n\nRow 3: All dots.\n\nRow 2: An apple at (0,2).\n\nRow 1: Apples at (8,1) and (7,1).\n\nRow 0: An apple at (4,0) and snake 1 at (4,0).\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,0), which is also where there's an apple. Does that mean snake 1 is on top of the apple, or is the apple still there? The board shows a '1' and an 'A' at (4,0), but maybe the '1' is the snake and 'A' is the apple. Hmm, that might be confusing.\n\nAlso, snake 1 has an empty body list, so it's just the head at (4,0). Me too, since I don't see any body parts listed for me.\n\nSo, my position: (0,9)\n\nApples at: (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), (7,1)\n\nEnemy snake at: (4,0)\n\nI need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential risks.\n\nLet me calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (0,9):\n\n1. (0,2): Distance is |0-0| + |9-2| = 0 + 7 = 7 steps.\n\n2. (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\n3. (8,1): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16 steps.\n\n4. (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\n5. (7,1): |0-7| + |9-1| = 7 + 8 = 15 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (0,2), 7 steps away.\n\nBut I should also consider the path to each apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet's visualize the grid:\n\nColumns 0 to 9, rows 0 to 9.\n\nMy position: (0,9)\n\nApple at (0,2): straight down, no obstacles seen in between.\n\nWait, but looking at the board state, row 2 has an 'A' at (0,2). From (0,9) to (0,2), that's moving down 7 rows.\n\nIs there any part of my body in the way? No, since I just started, I only have the head.\n\nSimilarly, is there any other snake in the way? Snake 1 is at (4,0), which is lower right.\n\nSo, path to (0,2): move down 7 steps.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider eating multiple apples in one go.\n\nLet me see: if I go to (0,2), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving right would take me towards (7,1) and (8,1), which are lower down.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up to (9,4), but that's farther.\n\nAlternatively, (5,5) is also an option.\n\nLet me think about a sequence.\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Go to (0,2): 7 steps down.\n\n2. After eating (0,2), I'm longer, so I need to be careful.\n\n3. From (0,2), I can move right to (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (7,1) is 7 steps right and 1 step down.\n\nWait, (7,1) is at column 7, row 1.\n\nFrom (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\nSo, from (0,2):\n\n- Move right 7 steps to (7,2)\n\n- Then down 1 step to (7,1)\n\n- Eat apple at (7,1)\n\n- Now, move right 1 step to (8,1) to eat another apple.\n\nTotal steps from start: 7 (down) + 7 (right) + 1 (down) + 1 (right) = 16 steps.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nOption 2:\n\nGo directly to (5,5):\n\nFrom (0,9) to (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nBut wait, in option 1, it was 16 steps for three apples, while option 2 is 14 steps for two apples.\n\nBut in option 1, I can potentially get three apples in 16 steps, while in option 2, only two in 14 steps.\n\nNot sure, need to think carefully.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Each time I eat an apple, my tail grows.\n\nSo, after eating (0,2), my tail will be longer, and I need to make sure I don't bump into it when making turns.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apples that are closer to each other first.\n\nLooking at the board, apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent.\n\nSo, maybe go to (7,1), eat it, then go to (8,1), eat it, then proceed to another apple.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps\n\n- Then right to (7,1): 7 steps\n\n- Eat (7,1)\n\n- Then right to (8,1): 1 step\n\n- Eat (8,1)\n\n- Now, where to next? (0,2), (5,5), or (9,4).\n\nFrom (8,1), to (5,5): |8-5| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps.\n\nTotal steps so far: 8 + 7 + 1 + 7 = 23 steps.\n\nThat seems too many.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), go up to (8,9), then left to (0,9), then down to (0,2), etc.\n\nBut that would be a very long detour.\n\nMaybe not efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (9,4).\n\nFrom (0,9), going to (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nThen from (9,4), I can go left to (5,4), then up to (5,5) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), so from (9,4), to (5,5): |9-5| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 14 + 5 = 19 steps.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best path.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (4,0), and it's just the head, no body.\n\nI need to make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nI don't know how the enemy snake will move, so I should assume it could move in any direction.\n\nBut for now, I'll plan my path assuming it stays put or moves in a way that doesn't block me.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to predict its movement based on the apple positions.\n\nBut perhaps that's too complicated for now.\n\nI need to make a decision for my next move.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by moving down towards the closest apple at (0,2).\n\nFrom (0,9), moving down to (0,2) is a straight path with no obstacles.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move down.\n\nBut wait, I need to specify left, right, up, or down.\n\nIn terms of coordinates:\n\n- Down corresponds to decreasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Up corresponds to increasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Left corresponds to decreasing x-coordinate.\n\n- Right corresponds to increasing x-coordinate.\n\nSo, to move down from (0,9) to (0,8), I should choose down.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, my next"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. So, I'm currently at position (0,9), which is the top-left corner of the board. There are five apples on the board: at (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), and (7,1). There's also an enemy snake at (4,0).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (0,2), which is straight down from my current position. Let's calculate the distance: from (0,9) to (0,2), that's a vertical move down by 7 steps. There don't seem to be any obstacles in that path, so that might be a safe starting point.\n\nBut I also need to think about what to do after eating that apple. After eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have a path that allows me to extend without bumping into myself.\n\nLet me consider the positions after eating (0,2). Once I eat it, my tail will extend, so I need to plan my moves carefully to avoid my own body.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), perhaps I can move right towards the apples at (7,1) and (8,1). From (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1) to eat another apple, and then to (8,1) for the third apple. That seems like a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (5,5) after (0,2). From (0,2), I can move right to (5,2), then up to (5,5). That's another option.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake at (4,0). I don't know how it will move, so I should assume it could potentially block some paths. For now, I'll plan my path away from it initially and see.\n\nLet me also look at the other apples. The apple at (9,4) is quite far away, requiring a move down to (0,4) and then right to (9,4), which is a long path and might not be efficient in the short term.\n\nSimilarly, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are in the lower right area. If I can pick up multiple apples in that area after getting (0,2), that would be ideal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for (0,2), then (7,1), then (8,1). Let's map that out.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 7 + 7 + 1 + 1 = 16 steps.\n\nThat seems manageable. Now, after eating three apples, my snake would be quite long, so I need to ensure that the path doesn't loop back on itself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (0,2), then up to (0,5), then right to (5,5) to get the apple there. But that seems less efficient because (5,5) is farther than (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nWait, from (0,2), moving up to (0,5) is actually moving up 3 steps, then right to (5,5), which is 5 steps right. That's 3 + 5 = 8 steps after the initial 7 steps to (0,2), totaling 15 steps for three apples. Hmm, that might be better.\n\nBut let's see: (0,2) to (0,5): up 3, then right to (5,5): 5 steps. That's a total of 7 + 3 + 5 = 15 steps.\n\nCompared to the previous path of 16 steps, this is shorter. However, I need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board, from (0,2) up to (0,5), then right to (5,5). It seems clear, but I need to make sure that I won't be bumping into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,5), I could then head over to (9,4). From (5,5), right to (9,5), then down to (9,4). That's 4 steps right and 1 step down, totaling 5 steps.\n\nSo, overall steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 3 (up to 0,5) + 5 (right to 5,5) + 4 (right to 9,5) + 1 (down to 9,4) = 7 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 20 steps.\n\nBut wait, after eating (5,5), my snake is longer, so I need to ensure that I can make these moves without hitting my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (5,5), I can go directly down to (5,4), then right to (9,4). That's 1 step down and 4 steps right, totaling 5 steps.\n\nOverall steps: 7 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 4 = still 20 steps.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nLet me consider going for (0,2), then directly to (9,4). From (0,2), right to (9,2), then down to (9,4). That's 9 steps right and 2 steps down, totaling 11 steps after the initial 7 steps, for a total of 18 steps.\n\nBut in this path, I would miss the apples at (7,1) and (8,1), which might not be optimal in terms of points, but it's faster in terms of steps.\n\nI need to balance between maximizing points and minimizing risk.\n\nAlso, I should consider that the enemy snake might be moving and potentially blocking my path.\n\nBut since I don't know its movement pattern, I'll have to plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for the apples that are closer together first, to minimize movement steps and maximize points.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent, so picking them up in sequence would be efficient.\n\nTo reach (7,1), from (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,1): 7 steps.\n\nTotal: 15 steps.\n\nThen, from (7,1), right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 16 steps for two apples.\n\nComparing to the previous path of 18 steps for two apples, this seems better.\n\nAfter that, I can head to (0,2), but that's now at (0,2), which is up left from (8,1). That would require:\n\n- Left to (8,2): 1 step.\n\n- Up to (8,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Left to (0,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\nThat's 1 + 8 + 8 + 7 = 24 steps, which is a lot.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), I could go up to (8,4), then right to (9,4) to get the apple there.\n\nFrom (8,1), up to (8,4): 3 steps.\n\nThen right to (9,4): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 15 (to 7,1) + 1 (to 8,1) + 3 (up to 8,4) + 1 (right to 9,4) = 20 steps for four apples.\n\nThen, finally, go to (5,5). From (9,4), left to (5,4): 4 steps.\n\nThen up to (5,5): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 20 + 4 + 1 = 25 steps for five apples.\n\nThis seems like a possible strategy.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself in these maneuvers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by going for (0,2), then (7,1), (8,1), (9,4), and finally (5,5).\n\nWait, but to get from (8,1) to (9,4), it's right to (9,1), then up to (9,4): 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n\nSo, total steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 7 (right to 7,2) + 1 (down to 7,1) + 1 (right to 8,1) + 1 (right to 9,1) + 3 (up to 9,4) + left to (5,4) + up to (5,5).\n\nWait, that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I need to sketch this out.\n\nLet's try to plan a path:\n\nStart at (0,9).\n\n1. Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n2. Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n3. Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n4. Right to (8,1):"

(7,1): |0-7| + |9-1| = 7 + 8 = 15 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (0,2), 7 steps away.\n\nBut I should also consider the path to each apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet's visualize the grid:\n\nColumns 0 to 9, rows 0 to 9.\n\nMy position: (0,9)\n\nApple at (0,2): straight down, no obstacles seen in between.\n\nWait, but looking at the board state, row 2 has an 'A' at (0,2). From (0,9) to (0,2), that's moving down 7 rows.\n\nIs there any part of my body in the way? No, since I just started, I only have the head.\n\nSimilarly, is there any other snake in the way? Snake 1 is at (4,0), which is lower right.\n\nSo, path to (0,2): move down 7 steps.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider eating multiple apples in one go.\n\nLet me see: if I go to (0,2), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving right would take me towards (7,1) and (8,1), which are lower down.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up to (9,4), but that's farther.\n\nAlternatively, (5,5) is also an option.\n\nLet me think about a sequence.\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Go to (0,2): 7 steps down.\n\n2. After eating (0,2), I'm longer, so I need to be careful.\n\n3. From (0,2), I can move right to (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (7,1) is 7 steps right and 1 step down.\n\nWait, (7,1) is at column 7, row 1.\n\nFrom (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\nSo, from (0,2):\n\n- Move right 7 steps to (7,2)\n\n- Then down 1 step to (7,1)\n\n- Eat apple at (7,1)\n\n- Now, move right 1 step to (8,1) to eat another apple.\n\nTotal steps from start: 7 (down) + 7 (right) + 1 (down) + 1 (right) = 16 steps.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nOption 2:\n\nGo directly to (5,5):\n\nFrom (0,9) to (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nBut wait, in option 1, it was 16 steps for three apples, while option 2 is 14 steps for two apples.\n\nBut in option 1, I can potentially get three apples in 16 steps, while in option 2, only two in 14 steps.\n\nNot sure, need to think carefully.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Each time I eat an apple, my tail grows.\n\nSo, after eating (0,2), my tail will be longer, and I need to make sure I don't bump into it when making turns.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apples that are closer to each other first.\n\nLooking at the board, apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent.\n\nSo, maybe go to (7,1), eat it, then go to (8,1), eat it, then proceed to another apple.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps\n\n- Then right to (7,1): 7 steps\n\n- Eat (7,1)\n\n- Then right to (8,1): 1 step\n\n- Eat (8,1)\n\n- Now, where to next? (0,2), (5,5), or (9,4).\n\nFrom (8,1), to (5,5): |8-5| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps.\n\nTotal steps so far: 8 + 7 + 1 + 7 = 23 steps.\n\nThat seems too many.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), go up to (8,9), then left to (0,9), then down to (0,2), etc.\n\nBut that would be a very long detour.\n\nMaybe not efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (9,4).\n\nFrom (0,9), going to (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nThen from (9,4), I can go left to (5,4), then up to (5,5) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), so from (9,4), to (5,5): |9-5| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 14 + 5 = 19 steps.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best path.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (4,0), and it's just the head, no body.\n\nI need to make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nI don't know how the enemy snake will move, so I should assume it could move in any direction.\n\nBut for now, I'll plan my path assuming it stays put or moves in a way that doesn't block me.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to predict its movement based on the apple positions.\n\nBut perhaps that's too complicated for now.\n\nI need to make a decision for my next move.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by moving down towards the closest apple at (0,2).\n\nFrom (0,9), moving down to (0,2) is a straight path with no obstacles.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move down.\n\nBut wait, I need to specify left, right, up, or down.\n\nIn terms of coordinates:\n\n- Down corresponds to decreasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Up corresponds to increasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Left corresponds to decreasing x-coordinate.\n\n- Right corresponds to increasing x-coordinate.\n\nSo, to move down from (0,9) to (0,8), I should choose down.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, my next"

There are five apples on the board: at (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), and (7,1). There's also an enemy snake at (4,0).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (0,2), which is straight down from my current position. Let's calculate the distance: from (0,9) to (0,2), that's a vertical move down by 7 steps. There don't seem to be any obstacles in that path, so that might be a safe starting point.\n\nBut I also need to think about what to do after eating that apple. After eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have a path that allows me to extend without bumping into myself.\n\nLet me consider the positions after eating (0,2). Once I eat it, my tail will extend, so I need to plan my moves carefully to avoid my own body.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), perhaps I can move right towards the apples at (7,1) and (8,1). From (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1) to eat another apple, and then to (8,1) for the third apple. That seems like a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (5,5) after (0,2). From (0,2), I can move right to (5,2), then up to (5,5). That's another option.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake at (4,0). I don't know how it will move, so I should assume it could potentially block some paths. For now, I'll plan my path away from it initially and see.\n\nLet me also look at the other apples. The apple at (9,4) is quite far away, requiring a move down to (0,4) and then right to (9,4), which is a long path and might not be efficient in the short term.\n\nSimilarly, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are in the lower right area. If I can pick up multiple apples in that area after getting (0,2), that would be ideal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for (0,2), then (7,1), then (8,1). Let's map that out.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 7 + 7 + 1 + 1 = 16 steps.\n\nThat seems manageable. Now, after eating three apples, my snake would be quite long, so I need to ensure that the path doesn't loop back on itself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (0,2), then up to (0,5), then right to (5,5) to get the apple there. But that seems less efficient because (5,5) is farther than (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nWait, from (0,2), moving up to (0,5) is actually moving up 3 steps, then right to (5,5), which is 5 steps right. That's 3 + 5 = 8 steps after the initial 7 steps to (0,2), totaling 15 steps for three apples. Hmm, that might be better.\n\nBut let's see: (0,2) to (0,5): up 3, then right to (5,5): 5 steps. That's a total of 7 + 3 + 5 = 15 steps.\n\nCompared to the previous path of 16 steps, this is shorter. However, I need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board, from (0,2) up to (0,5), then right to (5,5). It seems clear, but I need to make sure that I won't be bumping into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,5), I could then head over to (9,4). From (5,5), right to (9,5), then down to (9,4). That's 4 steps right and 1 step down, totaling 5 steps.\n\nSo, overall steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 3 (up to 0,5) + 5 (right to 5,5) + 4 (right to 9,5) + 1 (down to 9,4) = 7 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 20 steps.\n\nBut wait, after eating (5,5), my snake is longer, so I need to ensure that I can make these moves without hitting my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (5,5), I can go directly down to (5,4), then right to (9,4). That's 1 step down and 4 steps right, totaling 5 steps.\n\nOverall steps: 7 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 4 = still 20 steps.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nLet me consider going for (0,2), then directly to (9,4). From (0,2), right to (9,2), then down to (9,4). That's 9 steps right and 2 steps down, totaling 11 steps after the initial 7 steps, for a total of 18 steps.\n\nBut in this path, I would miss the apples at (7,1) and (8,1), which might not be optimal in terms of points, but it's faster in terms of steps.\n\nI need to balance between maximizing points and minimizing risk.\n\nAlso, I should consider that the enemy snake might be moving and potentially blocking my path.\n\nBut since I don't know its movement pattern, I'll have to plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for the apples that are closer together first, to minimize movement steps and maximize points.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent, so picking them up in sequence would be efficient.\n\nTo reach (7,1), from (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,1): 7 steps.\n\nTotal: 15 steps.\n\nThen, from (7,1), right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 16 steps for two apples.\n\nComparing to the previous path of 18 steps for two apples, this seems better.\n\nAfter that, I can head to (0,2), but that's now at (0,2), which is up left from (8,1). That would require:\n\n- Left to (8,2): 1 step.\n\n- Up to (8,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Left to (0,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\nThat's 1 + 8 + 8 + 7 = 24 steps, which is a lot.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), I could go up to (8,4), then right to (9,4) to get the apple there.\n\nFrom (8,1), up to (8,4): 3 steps.\n\nThen right to (9,4): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 15 (to 7,1) + 1 (to 8,1) + 3 (up to 8,4) + 1 (right to 9,4) = 20 steps for four apples.\n\nThen, finally, go to (5,5). From (9,4), left to (5,4): 4 steps.\n\nThen up to (5,5): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 20 + 4 + 1 = 25 steps for five apples.\n\nThis seems like a possible strategy.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself in these maneuvers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by going for (0,2), then (7,1), (8,1), (9,4), and finally (5,5).\n\nWait, but to get from (8,1) to (9,4), it's right to (9,1), then up to (9,4): 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n\nSo, total steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 7 (right to 7,2) + 1 (down to 7,1) + 1 (right to 8,1) + 1 (right to 9,1) + 3 (up to 9,4) + left to (5,4) + up to (5,5).\n\nWait, that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I need to sketch this out.\n\nLet's try to plan a path:\n\nStart at (0,9).\n\n1. Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n2. Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n3. Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n4. Right to (8,1):"

There's also an enemy snake at (2,1).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to collect as many apples as possible without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nLet me look at the positions:\n\n- I'm at (1,9).\n\n- Apples are at (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), and (7,1).\n\n- Enemy snake is at (2,1).\n\nI should consider the distances to each apple and plan a path that allows me to pick them up efficiently.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- (0,2): |1-0| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n- (9,4): |1-9| + |9-4| = 8 + 5 = 13\n\n- (8,1): |1-8| + |9-1| = 7 + 8 = 15\n\n- (5,5): |1-5| + |9-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (7,1): |1-7| + |9-1| = 6 + 8 = 14\n\nSo, the closest apples are (0,2) and (5,5), both with a distance of 8.\n\nI should consider which path might be better, considering the positions of other apples.\n\nLet's visualize the board:\n\n- (0,0) is bottom-left, (9,9) is top-right.\n\n- My snake is at (1,9), which is near the top.\n\n- Apples:\n\n  - (0,2): left, down\n\n  - (9,4): right, down\n\n  - (8,1): right, down\n\n  - (5,5): somewhat center\n\n  - (7,1): right, down\n\n- Enemy snake at (2,1): below and to the right.\n\nFirst, I need to avoid the enemy snake. Since it's at (2,1), and I'm at (1,9), it's below and to the right. I should plan paths that don't lead me directly into its area, especially since I don't know its direction.\n\nOption 1: Go for (0,2) first.\n\nFrom (1,9):\n\n- Move left to (0,9)\n\n- Move down to (0,2)\n\nThat's 1 left + 7 downs: total 8 moves.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure the next moves don't hit my own tail.\n\nThen, from (0,2), I can aim for other apples.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (5,5) is at (5,5)\n\n- (7,1) is at (7,1)\n\n- (8,1) is at (8,1)\n\n- (9,4) is at (9,4)\n\nFrom (0,2), the closest apple is (5,5):\n\n- |0-5| + |2-5| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\nAlternatively, (7,1):\n\n- |0-7| + |2-1| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n(8,1):\n\n- |0-8| + |2-1| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n(9,4):\n\n- |0-9| + |2-4| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\nSo, (5,5) and (7,1) are equally close from (0,2).\n\nLet's consider going to (5,5) first.\n\nFrom (0,2):\n\n- Right to (5,2): 5 steps\n\n- Up to (5,5): 3 steps\n\nTotal: 5 + 3 = 8 steps\n\nThen, from (5,5), let's see the next closest apple.\n\nApples left: (7,1), (8,1), (9,4)\n\nFrom (5,5):\n\n- (7,1): |5-7| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- (8,1): |5-8| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, (9,4) is the closest from (5,5).\n\nFrom (5,5):\n\n- Right to (9,5): 4 steps\n\n- Down to (9,4): 1 step\n\nTotal: 4 + 1 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (9,4), the remaining apples are (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nFrom (9,4):\n\n- Left to (7,4): 2 steps\n\n- Down to (7,1): 3 steps\n\nTotal: 2 + 3 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (7,1), right to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 1 step\n\nSo, overall steps:\n\n- (1,9) to (0,2): 8 steps\n\n- (0,2) to (5,5): 8 steps\n\n- (5,5) to (9,4): 5 steps\n\n- (9,4) to (7,1): 5 steps\n\n- (7,1) to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal steps: 8 + 8 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 27 steps\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path doesn't cause my snake to collide with itself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider going for (5,5) first.\n\nFrom (1,9):\n\n- Down to (1,5): 4 steps\n\n- Right to (5,5): 4 steps\n\nTotal: 4 + 4 = 8 steps\n\nThen, from (5,5):\n\n- Right to (9,5): 4 steps\n\n- Down to (9,4): 1 step\n\nTotal: 4 + 1 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (9,4):\n\n- Left to (7,4): 2 steps\n\n- Down to (7,1): 3 steps\n\nTotal: 2 + 3 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (7,1):\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 1 step\n\nSo, total steps:\n\n- (1,9) to (5,5): 8 steps\n\n- (5,5) to (9,4): 5 steps\n\n- (9,4) to (7,1): 5 steps\n\n- (7,1) to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 8 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 19 steps\n\nThis seems more efficient than the previous path.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1). If I can avoid that area, especially while the enemy might be moving, it's better.\n\nIn this path, I'm going down to (1,5), then right to (5,5), then right to (9,5), down to (9,4), left to (7,4), down to (7,1), and right to (8,1).\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), which is below my path mostly, so as long as I don't go directly into its position, I should be fine.\n\nBut I need to be cautious, especially when moving down.\n\nAlso, after eating each apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me back to my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1.

Right to (8,1)\n\nAt each step, after eating an apple, my tail extends.\n\nI need to ensure that the next move doesn't step on the new tail positions.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,5), my tail will have grown, so I need to make sure that moving right to (9,5) doesn't cause me to run into my own tail.\n\nSimilarly, after eating (9,4), moving left to (7,4) should be safe, provided I have a long enough path without hitting myself.\n\nThis seems manageable, but I need to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apples that are closer together first to minimize movement.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent, so picking them up in sequence would be efficient.\n\nFrom (1,9):\n\n- Down to (1,1): 8 steps\n\n- Right to (8,1): 7 steps\n\nTotal: 8 + 7 = 15 steps to (8,1)\n\nThen, left to (7,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 1 step\n\nThen"

(7,1): |0-7| + |9-1| = 7 + 8 = 15 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (0,2), 7 steps away.\n\nBut I should also consider the path to each apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet's visualize the grid:\n\nColumns 0 to 9, rows 0 to 9.\n\nMy position: (0,9)\n\nApple at (0,2): straight down, no obstacles seen in between.\n\nWait, but looking at the board state, row 2 has an 'A' at (0,2). From (0,9) to (0,2), that's moving down 7 rows.\n\nIs there any part of my body in the way? No, since I just started, I only have the head.\n\nSimilarly, is there any other snake in the way? Snake 1 is at (4,0), which is lower right.\n\nSo, path to (0,2): move down 7 steps.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider eating multiple apples in one go.\n\nLet me see: if I go to (0,2), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving right would take me towards (7,1) and (8,1), which are lower down.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up to (9,4), but that's farther.\n\nAlternatively, (5,5) is also an option.\n\nLet me think about a sequence.\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Go to (0,2): 7 steps down.\n\n2. After eating (0,2), I'm longer, so I need to be careful.\n\n3. From (0,2), I can move right to (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (7,1) is 7 steps right and 1 step down.\n\nWait, (7,1) is at column 7, row 1.\n\nFrom (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\nSo, from (0,2):\n\n- Move right 7 steps to (7,2)\n\n- Then down 1 step to (7,1)\n\n- Eat apple at (7,1)\n\n- Now, move right 1 step to (8,1) to eat another apple.\n\nTotal steps from start: 7 (down) + 7 (right) + 1 (down) + 1 (right) = 16 steps.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nOption 2:\n\nGo directly to (5,5):\n\nFrom (0,9) to (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nBut wait, in option 1, it was 16 steps for three apples, while option 2 is 14 steps for two apples.\n\nBut in option 1, I can potentially get three apples in 16 steps, while in option 2, only two in 14 steps.\n\nNot sure, need to think carefully.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Each time I eat an apple, my tail grows.\n\nSo, after eating (0,2), my tail will be longer, and I need to make sure I don't bump into it when making turns.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apples that are closer to each other first.\n\nLooking at the board, apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent.\n\nSo, maybe go to (7,1), eat it, then go to (8,1), eat it, then proceed to another apple.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps\n\n- Then right to (7,1): 7 steps\n\n- Eat (7,1)\n\n- Then right to (8,1): 1 step\n\n- Eat (8,1)\n\n- Now, where to next? (0,2), (5,5), or (9,4).\n\nFrom (8,1), to (5,5): |8-5| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps.\n\nTotal steps so far: 8 + 7 + 1 + 7 = 23 steps.\n\nThat seems too many.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), go up to (8,9), then left to (0,9), then down to (0,2), etc.\n\nBut that would be a very long detour.\n\nMaybe not efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (9,4).\n\nFrom (0,9), going to (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nThen from (9,4), I can go left to (5,4), then up to (5,5) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), so from (9,4), to (5,5): |9-5| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 14 + 5 = 19 steps.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best path.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (4,0), and it's just the head, no body.\n\nI need to make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nI don't know how the enemy snake will move, so I should assume it could move in any direction.\n\nBut for now, I'll plan my path assuming it stays put or moves in a way that doesn't block me.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to predict its movement based on the apple positions.\n\nBut perhaps that's too complicated for now.\n\nI need to make a decision for my next move.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by moving down towards the closest apple at (0,2).\n\nFrom (0,9), moving down to (0,2) is a straight path with no obstacles.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move down.\n\nBut wait, I need to specify left, right, up, or down.\n\nIn terms of coordinates:\n\n- Down corresponds to decreasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Up corresponds to increasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Left corresponds to decreasing x-coordinate.\n\n- Right corresponds to increasing x-coordinate.\n\nSo, to move down from (0,9) to (0,8), I should choose down.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, my next"

There are five apples on the board: at (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), and (7,1). There's also an enemy snake at (4,0).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (0,2), which is straight down from my current position. Let's calculate the distance: from (0,9) to (0,2), that's a vertical move down by 7 steps. There don't seem to be any obstacles in that path, so that might be a safe starting point.\n\nBut I also need to think about what to do after eating that apple. After eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have a path that allows me to extend without bumping into myself.\n\nLet me consider the positions after eating (0,2). Once I eat it, my tail will extend, so I need to plan my moves carefully to avoid my own body.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), perhaps I can move right towards the apples at (7,1) and (8,1). From (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1) to eat another apple, and then to (8,1) for the third apple. That seems like a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (5,5) after (0,2). From (0,2), I can move right to (5,2), then up to (5,5). That's another option.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake at (4,0). I don't know how it will move, so I should assume it could potentially block some paths. For now, I'll plan my path away from it initially and see.\n\nLet me also look at the other apples. The apple at (9,4) is quite far away, requiring a move down to (0,4) and then right to (9,4), which is a long path and might not be efficient in the short term.\n\nSimilarly, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are in the lower right area. If I can pick up multiple apples in that area after getting (0,2), that would be ideal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for (0,2), then (7,1), then (8,1). Let's map that out.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 7 + 7 + 1 + 1 = 16 steps.\n\nThat seems manageable. Now, after eating three apples, my snake would be quite long, so I need to ensure that the path doesn't loop back on itself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (0,2), then up to (0,5), then right to (5,5) to get the apple there. But that seems less efficient because (5,5) is farther than (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nWait, from (0,2), moving up to (0,5) is actually moving up 3 steps, then right to (5,5), which is 5 steps right. That's 3 + 5 = 8 steps after the initial 7 steps to (0,2), totaling 15 steps for three apples. Hmm, that might be better.\n\nBut let's see: (0,2) to (0,5): up 3, then right to (5,5): 5 steps. That's a total of 7 + 3 + 5 = 15 steps.\n\nCompared to the previous path of 16 steps, this is shorter. However, I need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board, from (0,2) up to (0,5), then right to (5,5). It seems clear, but I need to make sure that I won't be bumping into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,5), I could then head over to (9,4). From (5,5), right to (9,5), then down to (9,4). That's 4 steps right and 1 step down, totaling 5 steps.\n\nSo, overall steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 3 (up to 0,5) + 5 (right to 5,5) + 4 (right to 9,5) + 1 (down to 9,4) = 7 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 20 steps.\n\nBut wait, after eating (5,5), my snake is longer, so I need to ensure that I can make these moves without hitting my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (5,5), I can go directly down to (5,4), then right to (9,4). That's 1 step down and 4 steps right, totaling 5 steps.\n\nOverall steps: 7 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 4 = still 20 steps.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nLet me consider going for (0,2), then directly to (9,4). From (0,2), right to (9,2), then down to (9,4). That's 9 steps right and 2 steps down, totaling 11 steps after the initial 7 steps, for a total of 18 steps.\n\nBut in this path, I would miss the apples at (7,1) and (8,1), which might not be optimal in terms of points, but it's faster in terms of steps.\n\nI need to balance between maximizing points and minimizing risk.\n\nAlso, I should consider that the enemy snake might be moving and potentially blocking my path.\n\nBut since I don't know its movement pattern, I'll have to plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for the apples that are closer together first, to minimize movement steps and maximize points.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent, so picking them up in sequence would be efficient.\n\nTo reach (7,1), from (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,1): 7 steps.\n\nTotal: 15 steps.\n\nThen, from (7,1), right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 16 steps for two apples.\n\nComparing to the previous path of 18 steps for two apples, this seems better.\n\nAfter that, I can head to (0,2), but that's now at (0,2), which is up left from (8,1). That would require:\n\n- Left to (8,2): 1 step.\n\n- Up to (8,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Left to (0,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\nThat's 1 + 8 + 8 + 7 = 24 steps, which is a lot.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), I could go up to (8,4), then right to (9,4) to get the apple there.\n\nFrom (8,1), up to (8,4): 3 steps.\n\nThen right to (9,4): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 15 (to 7,1) + 1 (to 8,1) + 3 (up to 8,4) + 1 (right to 9,4) = 20 steps for four apples.\n\nThen, finally, go to (5,5). From (9,4), left to (5,4): 4 steps.\n\nThen up to (5,5): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 20 + 4 + 1 = 25 steps for five apples.\n\nThis seems like a possible strategy.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself in these maneuvers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by going for (0,2), then (7,1), (8,1), (9,4), and finally (5,5).\n\nWait, but to get from (8,1) to (9,4), it's right to (9,1), then up to (9,4): 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n\nSo, total steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 7 (right to 7,2) + 1 (down to 7,1) + 1 (right to 8,1) + 1 (right to 9,1) + 3 (up to 9,4) + left to (5,4) + up to (5,5).\n\nWait, that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I need to sketch this out.\n\nLet's try to plan a path:\n\nStart at (0,9).\n\n1. Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n2. Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n3. Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n4. Right to (8,1):"

There's also an enemy snake at (2,1).\n\nFirst, I need to plan a path to collect as many apples as possible without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nLet me look at the positions:\n\n- I'm at (1,9).\n\n- Apples are at (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), and (7,1).\n\n- Enemy snake is at (2,1).\n\nI should consider the distances to each apple and plan a path that allows me to pick them up efficiently.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- (0,2): |1-0| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n- (9,4): |1-9| + |9-4| = 8 + 5 = 13\n\n- (8,1): |1-8| + |9-1| = 7 + 8 = 15\n\n- (5,5): |1-5| + |9-5| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (7,1): |1-7| + |9-1| = 6 + 8 = 14\n\nSo, the closest apples are (0,2) and (5,5), both with a distance of 8.\n\nI should consider which path might be better, considering the positions of other apples.\n\nLet's visualize the board:\n\n- (0,0) is bottom-left, (9,9) is top-right.\n\n- My snake is at (1,9), which is near the top.\n\n- Apples:\n\n  - (0,2): left, down\n\n  - (9,4): right, down\n\n  - (8,1): right, down\n\n  - (5,5): somewhat center\n\n  - (7,1): right, down\n\n- Enemy snake at (2,1): below and to the right.\n\nFirst, I need to avoid the enemy snake. Since it's at (2,1), and I'm at (1,9), it's below and to the right. I should plan paths that don't lead me directly into its area, especially since I don't know its direction.\n\nOption 1: Go for (0,2) first.\n\nFrom (1,9):\n\n- Move left to (0,9)\n\n- Move down to (0,2)\n\nThat's 1 left + 7 downs: total 8 moves.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure the next moves don't hit my own tail.\n\nThen, from (0,2), I can aim for other apples.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (5,5) is at (5,5)\n\n- (7,1) is at (7,1)\n\n- (8,1) is at (8,1)\n\n- (9,4) is at (9,4)\n\nFrom (0,2), the closest apple is (5,5):\n\n- |0-5| + |2-5| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\nAlternatively, (7,1):\n\n- |0-7| + |2-1| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n(8,1):\n\n- |0-8| + |2-1| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n(9,4):\n\n- |0-9| + |2-4| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\nSo, (5,5) and (7,1) are equally close from (0,2).\n\nLet's consider going to (5,5) first.\n\nFrom (0,2):\n\n- Right to (5,2): 5 steps\n\n- Up to (5,5): 3 steps\n\nTotal: 5 + 3 = 8 steps\n\nThen, from (5,5), let's see the next closest apple.\n\nApples left: (7,1), (8,1), (9,4)\n\nFrom (5,5):\n\n- (7,1): |5-7| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- (8,1): |5-8| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, (9,4) is the closest from (5,5).\n\nFrom (5,5):\n\n- Right to (9,5): 4 steps\n\n- Down to (9,4): 1 step\n\nTotal: 4 + 1 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (9,4), the remaining apples are (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nFrom (9,4):\n\n- Left to (7,4): 2 steps\n\n- Down to (7,1): 3 steps\n\nTotal: 2 + 3 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (7,1), right to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 1 step\n\nSo, overall steps:\n\n- (1,9) to (0,2): 8 steps\n\n- (0,2) to (5,5): 8 steps\n\n- (5,5) to (9,4): 5 steps\n\n- (9,4) to (7,1): 5 steps\n\n- (7,1) to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal steps: 8 + 8 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 27 steps\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path doesn't cause my snake to collide with itself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider going for (5,5) first.\n\nFrom (1,9):\n\n- Down to (1,5): 4 steps\n\n- Right to (5,5): 4 steps\n\nTotal: 4 + 4 = 8 steps\n\nThen, from (5,5):\n\n- Right to (9,5): 4 steps\n\n- Down to (9,4): 1 step\n\nTotal: 4 + 1 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (9,4):\n\n- Left to (7,4): 2 steps\n\n- Down to (7,1): 3 steps\n\nTotal: 2 + 3 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (7,1):\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 1 step\n\nSo, total steps:\n\n- (1,9) to (5,5): 8 steps\n\n- (5,5) to (9,4): 5 steps\n\n- (9,4) to (7,1): 5 steps\n\n- (7,1) to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 8 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 19 steps\n\nThis seems more efficient than the previous path.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1). If I can avoid that area, especially while the enemy might be moving, it's better.\n\nIn this path, I'm going down to (1,5), then right to (5,5), then right to (9,5), down to (9,4), left to (7,4), down to (7,1), and right to (8,1).\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), which is below my path mostly, so as long as I don't go directly into its position, I should be fine.\n\nBut I need to be cautious, especially when moving down.\n\nAlso, after eating each apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me back to my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1.

Right to (8,1)\n\nAt each step, after eating an apple, my tail extends.\n\nI need to ensure that the next move doesn't step on the new tail positions.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,5), my tail will have grown, so I need to make sure that moving right to (9,5) doesn't cause me to run into my own tail.\n\nSimilarly, after eating (9,4), moving left to (7,4) should be safe, provided I have a long enough path without hitting myself.\n\nThis seems manageable, but I need to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apples that are closer together first to minimize movement.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent, so picking them up in sequence would be efficient.\n\nFrom (1,9):\n\n- Down to (1,1): 8 steps\n\n- Right to (8,1): 7 steps\n\nTotal: 8 + 7 = 15 steps to (8,1)\n\nThen, left to (7,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 1 step\n\nThen"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (0,9). That's the top-left corner, right? Let me confirm: coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. So (0,9) is indeed the top-left.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: 2 (me) and some dots.\n\nRow 8: All dots.\n\nRow 7: All dots.\n\nRow 6: All dots.\n\nRow 5: An apple at (5,5).\n\nRow 4: An apple at (9,4).\n\nRow 3: All dots.\n\nRow 2: An apple at (0,2).\n\nRow 1: Apples at (8,1) and (7,1).\n\nRow 0: An apple at (4,0) and snake 1 at (4,0).\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,0), which is also where there's an apple. Does that mean snake 1 is on top of the apple, or is the apple still there? The board shows a '1' and an 'A' at (4,0), but maybe the '1' is the snake and 'A' is the apple. Hmm, that might be confusing.\n\nAlso, snake 1 has an empty body list, so it's just the head at (4,0). Me too, since I don't see any body parts listed for me.\n\nSo, my position: (0,9)\n\nApples at: (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), (7,1)\n\nEnemy snake at: (4,0)\n\nI need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential risks.\n\nLet me calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (0,9):\n\n1. (0,2): Distance is |0-0| + |9-2| = 0 + 7 = 7 steps.\n\n2. (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\n3. (8,1): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16 steps.\n\n4. (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\n5. (7,1): |0-7| + |9-1| = 7 + 8 = 15 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (0,2), 7 steps away.\n\nBut I should also consider the path to each apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet's visualize the grid:\n\nColumns 0 to 9, rows 0 to 9.\n\nMy position: (0,9)\n\nApple at (0,2): straight down, no obstacles seen in between.\n\nWait, but looking at the board state, row 2 has an 'A' at (0,2). From (0,9) to (0,2), that's moving down 7 rows.\n\nIs there any part of my body in the way? No, since I just started, I only have the head.\n\nSimilarly, is there any other snake in the way? Snake 1 is at (4,0), which is lower right.\n\nSo, path to (0,2): move down 7 steps.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider eating multiple apples in one go.\n\nLet me see: if I go to (0,2), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving right would take me towards (7,1) and (8,1), which are lower down.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up to (9,4), but that's farther.\n\nAlternatively, (5,5) is also an option.\n\nLet me think about a sequence.\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Go to (0,2): 7 steps down.\n\n2. After eating (0,2), I'm longer, so I need to be careful.\n\n3. From (0,2), I can move right to (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (7,1) is 7 steps right and 1 step down.\n\nWait, (7,1) is at column 7, row 1.\n\nFrom (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\nSo, from (0,2):\n\n- Move right 7 steps to (7,2)\n\n- Then down 1 step to (7,1)\n\n- Eat apple at (7,1)\n\n- Now, move right 1 step to (8,1) to eat another apple.\n\nTotal steps from start: 7 (down) + 7 (right) + 1 (down) + 1 (right) = 16 steps.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nOption 2:\n\nGo directly to (5,5):\n\nFrom (0,9) to (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nBut wait, in option 1, it was 16 steps for three apples, while option 2 is 14 steps for two apples.\n\nBut in option 1, I can potentially get three apples in 16 steps, while in option 2, only two in 14 steps.\n\nNot sure, need to think carefully.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Each time I eat an apple, my tail grows.\n\nSo, after eating (0,2), my tail will be longer, and I need to make sure I don't bump into it when making turns.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apples that are closer to each other first.\n\nLooking at the board, apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent.\n\nSo, maybe go to (7,1), eat it, then go to (8,1), eat it, then proceed to another apple.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps\n\n- Then right to (7,1): 7 steps\n\n- Eat (7,1)\n\n- Then right to (8,1): 1 step\n\n- Eat (8,1)\n\n- Now, where to next? (0,2), (5,5), or (9,4).\n\nFrom (8,1), to (5,5): |8-5| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps.\n\nTotal steps so far: 8 + 7 + 1 + 7 = 23 steps.\n\nThat seems too many.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), go up to (8,9), then left to (0,9), then down to (0,2), etc.\n\nBut that would be a very long detour.\n\nMaybe not efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (9,4).\n\nFrom (0,9), going to (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nThen from (9,4), I can go left to (5,4), then up to (5,5) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), so from (9,4), to (5,5): |9-5| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 14 + 5 = 19 steps.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best path.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (4,0), and it's just the head, no body.\n\nI need to make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nI don't know how the enemy snake will move, so I should assume it could move in any direction.\n\nBut for now, I'll plan my path assuming it stays put or moves in a way that doesn't block me.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to predict its movement based on the apple positions.\n\nBut perhaps that's too complicated for now.\n\nI need to make a decision for my next move.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by moving down towards the closest apple at (0,2).\n\nFrom (0,9), moving down to (0,2) is a straight path with no obstacles.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move down.\n\nBut wait, I need to specify left, right, up, or down.\n\nIn terms of coordinates:\n\n- Down corresponds to decreasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Up corresponds to increasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Left corresponds to decreasing x-coordinate.\n\n- Right corresponds to increasing x-coordinate.\n\nSo, to move down from (0,9) to (0,8), I should choose down.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, my next"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. So, I'm currently at position (0,9), which is the top-left corner of the board. There are five apples on the board: at (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), and (7,1). There's also an enemy snake at (4,0).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (0,2), which is straight down from my current position. Let's calculate the distance: from (0,9) to (0,2), that's a vertical move down by 7 steps. There don't seem to be any obstacles in that path, so that might be a safe starting point.\n\nBut I also need to think about what to do after eating that apple. After eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have a path that allows me to extend without bumping into myself.\n\nLet me consider the positions after eating (0,2). Once I eat it, my tail will extend, so I need to plan my moves carefully to avoid my own body.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), perhaps I can move right towards the apples at (7,1) and (8,1). From (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1) to eat another apple, and then to (8,1) for the third apple. That seems like a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (5,5) after (0,2). From (0,2), I can move right to (5,2), then up to (5,5). That's another option.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake at (4,0). I don't know how it will move, so I should assume it could potentially block some paths. For now, I'll plan my path away from it initially and see.\n\nLet me also look at the other apples. The apple at (9,4) is quite far away, requiring a move down to (0,4) and then right to (9,4), which is a long path and might not be efficient in the short term.\n\nSimilarly, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are in the lower right area. If I can pick up multiple apples in that area after getting (0,2), that would be ideal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for (0,2), then (7,1), then (8,1). Let's map that out.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 7 + 7 + 1 + 1 = 16 steps.\n\nThat seems manageable. Now, after eating three apples, my snake would be quite long, so I need to ensure that the path doesn't loop back on itself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (0,2), then up to (0,5), then right to (5,5) to get the apple there. But that seems less efficient because (5,5) is farther than (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nWait, from (0,2), moving up to (0,5) is actually moving up 3 steps, then right to (5,5), which is 5 steps right. That's 3 + 5 = 8 steps after the initial 7 steps to (0,2), totaling 15 steps for three apples. Hmm, that might be better.\n\nBut let's see: (0,2) to (0,5): up 3, then right to (5,5): 5 steps. That's a total of 7 + 3 + 5 = 15 steps.\n\nCompared to the previous path of 16 steps, this is shorter. However, I need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board, from (0,2) up to (0,5), then right to (5,5). It seems clear, but I need to make sure that I won't be bumping into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,5), I could then head over to (9,4). From (5,5), right to (9,5), then down to (9,4). That's 4 steps right and 1 step down, totaling 5 steps.\n\nSo, overall steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 3 (up to 0,5) + 5 (right to 5,5) + 4 (right to 9,5) + 1 (down to 9,4) = 7 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 20 steps.\n\nBut wait, after eating (5,5), my snake is longer, so I need to ensure that I can make these moves without hitting my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (5,5), I can go directly down to (5,4), then right to (9,4). That's 1 step down and 4 steps right, totaling 5 steps.\n\nOverall steps: 7 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 4 = still 20 steps.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nLet me consider going for (0,2), then directly to (9,4). From (0,2), right to (9,2), then down to (9,4).

That would require:\n\n- Left to (8,2): 1 step.\n\n- Up to (8,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Left to (0,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\nThat's 1 + 8 + 8 + 7 = 24 steps, which is a lot.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), I could go up to (8,4), then right to (9,4) to get the apple there.\n\nFrom (8,1), up to (8,4): 3 steps.\n\nThen right to (9,4): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 15 (to 7,1) + 1 (to 8,1) + 3 (up to 8,4) + 1 (right to 9,4) = 20 steps for four apples.\n\nThen, finally, go to (5,5). From (9,4), left to (5,4): 4 steps.\n\nThen up to (5,5): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 20 + 4 + 1 = 25 steps for five apples.\n\nThis seems like a possible strategy.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself in these maneuvers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by going for (0,2), then (7,1), (8,1), (9,4), and finally (5,5).\n\nWait, but to get from (8,1) to (9,4), it's right to (9,1), then up to (9,4): 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n\nSo, total steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 7 (right to 7,2) + 1 (down to 7,1) + 1 (right to 8,1) + 1 (right to 9,1) + 3 (up to 9,4) + left to (5,4) + up to (5,5).\n\nWait, that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I need to sketch this out.\n\nLet's try to plan a path:\n\nStart at (0,9).\n\n1. Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n2. Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n3. Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n4. Right to (8,1):"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (0,9). That's the top-left corner, right? Let me confirm: coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. So (0,9) is indeed the top-left.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: 2 (me) and some dots.\n\nRow 8: All dots.\n\nRow 7: All dots.\n\nRow 6: All dots.\n\nRow 5: An apple at (5,5).\n\nRow 4: An apple at (9,4).\n\nRow 3: All dots.\n\nRow 2: An apple at (0,2).\n\nRow 1: Apples at (8,1) and (7,1).\n\nRow 0: An apple at (4,0) and snake 1 at (4,0).\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,0), which is also where there's an apple. Does that mean snake 1 is on top of the apple, or is the apple still there? The board shows a '1' and an 'A' at (4,0), but maybe the '1' is the snake and 'A' is the apple. Hmm, that might be confusing.\n\nAlso, snake 1 has an empty body list, so it's just the head at (4,0). Me too, since I don't see any body parts listed for me.\n\nSo, my position: (0,9)\n\nApples at: (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), (7,1)\n\nEnemy snake at: (4,0)\n\nI need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential risks.\n\nLet me calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (0,9):\n\n1. (0,2): Distance is |0-0| + |9-2| = 0 + 7 = 7 steps.\n\n2. (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\n3. (8,1): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16 steps.\n\n4. (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\n5. (7,1): |0-7| + |9-1| = 7 + 8 = 15 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (0,2), 7 steps away.\n\nBut I should also consider the path to each apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet's visualize the grid:\n\nColumns 0 to 9, rows 0 to 9.\n\nMy position: (0,9)\n\nApple at (0,2): straight down, no obstacles seen in between.\n\nWait, but looking at the board state, row 2 has an 'A' at (0,2). From (0,9) to (0,2), that's moving down 7 rows.\n\nIs there any part of my body in the way? No, since I just started, I only have the head.\n\nSimilarly, is there any other snake in the way? Snake 1 is at (4,0), which is lower right.\n\nSo, path to (0,2): move down 7 steps.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider eating multiple apples in one go.\n\nLet me see: if I go to (0,2), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving right would take me towards (7,1) and (8,1), which are lower down.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up to (9,4), but that's farther.\n\nAlternatively, (5,5) is also an option.\n\nLet me think about a sequence.\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Go to (0,2): 7 steps down.\n\n2. After eating (0,2), I'm longer, so I need to be careful.\n\n3. From (0,2), I can move right to (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (7,1) is 7 steps right and 1 step down.\n\nWait, (7,1) is at column 7, row 1.\n\nFrom (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\nSo, from (0,2):\n\n- Move right 7 steps to (7,2)\n\n- Then down 1 step to (7,1)\n\n- Eat apple at (7,1)\n\n- Now, move right 1 step to (8,1) to eat another apple.\n\nTotal steps from start: 7 (down) + 7 (right) + 1 (down) + 1 (right) = 16 steps.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nOption 2:\n\nGo directly to (5,5):\n\nFrom (0,9) to (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nBut wait, in option 1, it was 16 steps for three apples, while option 2 is 14 steps for two apples.\n\nBut in option 1, I can potentially get three apples in 16 steps, while in option 2, only two in 14 steps.\n\nNot sure, need to think carefully.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Each time I eat an apple, my tail grows.\n\nSo, after eating (0,2), my tail will be longer, and I need to make sure I don't bump into it when making turns.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apples that are closer to each other first.\n\nLooking at the board, apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent.\n\nSo, maybe go to (7,1), eat it, then go to (8,1), eat it, then proceed to another apple.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps\n\n- Then right to (7,1): 7 steps\n\n- Eat (7,1)\n\n- Then right to (8,1): 1 step\n\n- Eat (8,1)\n\n- Now, where to next? (0,2), (5,5), or (9,4).\n\nFrom (8,1), to (5,5): |8-5| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps.\n\nTotal steps so far: 8 + 7 + 1 + 7 = 23 steps.\n\nThat seems too many.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), go up to (8,9), then left to (0,9), then down to (0,2), etc.\n\nBut that would be a very long detour.\n\nMaybe not efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (9,4).\n\nFrom (0,9), going to (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nThen from (9,4), I can go left to (5,4), then up to (5,5) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), so from (9,4), to (5,5): |9-5| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 14 + 5 = 19 steps.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best path.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (4,0), and it's just the head, no body.\n\nI need to make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nI don't know how the enemy snake will move, so I should assume it could move in any direction.\n\nBut for now, I'll plan my path assuming it stays put or moves in a way that doesn't block me.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to predict its movement based on the apple positions.\n\nBut perhaps that's too complicated for now.\n\nI need to make a decision for my next move.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by moving down towards the closest apple at (0,2).\n\nFrom (0,9), moving down to (0,2) is a straight path with no obstacles.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move down.\n\nBut wait, I need to specify left, right, up, or down.\n\nIn terms of coordinates:\n\n- Down corresponds to decreasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Up corresponds to increasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Left corresponds to decreasing x-coordinate.\n\n- Right corresponds to increasing x-coordinate.\n\nSo, to move down from (0,9) to (0,8), I should choose down.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, my next"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. So, I'm currently at position (0,9), which is the top-left corner of the board. There are five apples on the board: at (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), and (7,1). There's also an enemy snake at (4,0).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (0,2), which is straight down from my current position. Let's calculate the distance: from (0,9) to (0,2), that's a vertical move down by 7 steps. There don't seem to be any obstacles in that path, so that might be a safe starting point.\n\nBut I also need to think about what to do after eating that apple. After eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have a path that allows me to extend without bumping into myself.\n\nLet me consider the positions after eating (0,2). Once I eat it, my tail will extend, so I need to plan my moves carefully to avoid my own body.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), perhaps I can move right towards the apples at (7,1) and (8,1). From (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1) to eat another apple, and then to (8,1) for the third apple. That seems like a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (5,5) after (0,2). From (0,2), I can move right to (5,2), then up to (5,5). That's another option.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake at (4,0). I don't know how it will move, so I should assume it could potentially block some paths. For now, I'll plan my path away from it initially and see.\n\nLet me also look at the other apples. The apple at (9,4) is quite far away, requiring a move down to (0,4) and then right to (9,4), which is a long path and might not be efficient in the short term.\n\nSimilarly, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are in the lower right area. If I can pick up multiple apples in that area after getting (0,2), that would be ideal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for (0,2), then (7,1), then (8,1). Let's map that out.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 7 + 7 + 1 + 1 = 16 steps.\n\nThat seems manageable. Now, after eating three apples, my snake would be quite long, so I need to ensure that the path doesn't loop back on itself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (0,2), then up to (0,5), then right to (5,5) to get the apple there. But that seems less efficient because (5,5) is farther than (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nWait, from (0,2), moving up to (0,5) is actually moving up 3 steps, then right to (5,5), which is 5 steps right. That's 3 + 5 = 8 steps after the initial 7 steps to (0,2), totaling 15 steps for three apples. Hmm, that might be better.\n\nBut let's see: (0,2) to (0,5): up 3, then right to (5,5): 5 steps. That's a total of 7 + 3 + 5 = 15 steps.\n\nCompared to the previous path of 16 steps, this is shorter. However, I need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board, from (0,2) up to (0,5), then right to (5,5). It seems clear, but I need to make sure that I won't be bumping into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,5), I could then head over to (9,4). From (5,5), right to (9,5), then down to (9,4). That's 4 steps right and 1 step down, totaling 5 steps.\n\nSo, overall steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 3 (up to 0,5) + 5 (right to 5,5) + 4 (right to 9,5) + 1 (down to 9,4) = 7 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 20 steps.\n\nBut wait, after eating (5,5), my snake is longer, so I need to ensure that I can make these moves without hitting my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (5,5), I can go directly down to (5,4), then right to (9,4). That's 1 step down and 4 steps right, totaling 5 steps.\n\nOverall steps: 7 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 4 = still 20 steps.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nLet me consider going for (0,2), then directly to (9,4). From (0,2), right to (9,2), then down to (9,4).

That would require:\n\n- Left to (8,2): 1 step.\n\n- Up to (8,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Left to (0,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\nThat's 1 + 8 + 8 + 7 = 24 steps, which is a lot.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), I could go up to (8,4), then right to (9,4) to get the apple there.\n\nFrom (8,1), up to (8,4): 3 steps.\n\nThen right to (9,4): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 15 (to 7,1) + 1 (to 8,1) + 3 (up to 8,4) + 1 (right to 9,4) = 20 steps for four apples.\n\nThen, finally, go to (5,5). From (9,4), left to (5,4): 4 steps.\n\nThen up to (5,5): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 20 + 4 + 1 = 25 steps for five apples.\n\nThis seems like a possible strategy.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself in these maneuvers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by going for (0,2), then (7,1), (8,1), (9,4), and finally (5,5).\n\nWait, but to get from (8,1) to (9,4), it's right to (9,1), then up to (9,4): 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n\nSo, total steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 7 (right to 7,2) + 1 (down to 7,1) + 1 (right to 8,1) + 1 (right to 9,1) + 3 (up to 9,4) + left to (5,4) + up to (5,5).\n\nWait, that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I need to sketch this out.\n\nLet's try to plan a path:\n\nStart at (0,9).\n\n1. Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n2. Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n3. Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n4. Right to (8,1):"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (8,8), and I need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right. There are apples at (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), (7,1), and (5,1). Also, there's an enemy snake at (4,5) with its body at (3,5) and (2,5).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to collect as many apples as possible without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or my own body. Since this is a turn-based game, I have to think step by step.\n\nLet me visualize the board. The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. My snake is at (8,8), which is towards the top-right corner.\n\nI should consider the distances to each apple and think about which one to go for first. Let's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- (9,4): |8-9| + |8-4| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- (8,1): |8-8| + |8-1| = 0 + 7 = 7\n\n- (5,5): |8-5| + |8-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- (7,1): |8-7| + |8-1| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n- (5,1): |8-5| + |8-1| = 3 + 7 = 10\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,4) with a distance of 5.\n\nLet me think about moving towards (9,4). From (8,8), I need to go down to (9,8), then left to (9,4). But wait, moving down to (9,8) is okay, but then left to (9,4), I need to make sure there are no obstacles in between.\n\nWait, but looking back at the board state you provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . T T 1 A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . A . A A .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my snake is at (8,8), which is row 8, column 8, and there's an apple at (9,4), which is row 9, column 4.\n\nFrom (8,8), if I go down to (9,8), then left to (9,4), but looking at row 9, it seems empty except for the apple at (9,4). So, that might be a possible path.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake and its possible movements. The enemy is at (4,5) with body at (3,5) and (2,5). I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nMoreover, I need to think about the sequence of picking up apples. Going for the closest one first might not always be the best strategy if it blocks access to others.\n\nLet me consider the positions of all apples:\n\n- (9,4)\n\n- (8,1)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (7,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\nI'm at (8,8). If I go to (9,4), then from there, I can go to (8,1), then to (7,1), then to (5,1), and finally to (5,5). Let's calculate the total distance:\n\n- (8,8) to (9,4): 5\n\n- (9,4) to (8,1): |9-8| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (8,1) to (7,1): 1\n\n- (7,1) to (5,1): 2\n\n- (5,1) to (5,5): 4\n\nTotal steps: 5 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 16\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (5,5) first:\n\n- (8,8) to (5,5): |8-5| + |8-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- (5,5) to (5,1): 4\n\n- (5,1) to (7,1): 2\n\n- (7,1) to (8,1): 1\n\n- (8,1) to (9,4): 5\n\nTotal steps: 6 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 5 = 18\n\nSo, going to (9,4) first seems shorter in terms of steps.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements. The enemy is at (4,5) with body at (3,5) and (2,5). I need to predict where it might be in the future turns.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake is moving somehow, I need to anticipate its path and make sure I don't cross it.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should simplify and just focus on the immediate move.\n\nLooking at my current position (8,8), possible moves are:\n\n- Up to (8,9)\n\n- Down to (9,8)\n\n- Left to (7,8)\n\n- Right to (8,9)\n\nWait, up is (8,9), down is (9,8), left is (7,8), right is (8,9). Wait, up and right both seem to be (8,9), which can't be right.\n\nWait, in this coordinate system, increasing y is up, so up from (8,8) is (8,9), down is (8,7), left is (7,8), right is (9,8).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, from (8,8), possible moves are:\n\n- Up to (8,9)\n\n- Down to (8,7)\n\n- Left to (7,8)\n\n- Right to (9,8)\n\nNow, looking at the board:\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . T T 1 A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . A . A A .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (8,8):\n\n- Up to (8,9): seems empty\n\n- Down to (8,7): seems empty\n\n- Left to (7,8): seems empty\n\n- Right to (9,8): seems empty\n\nAmong these, moving down to (8,7) would bring me closer to the apple at (9,4), but maybe moving right to (9,8) would be better to align with (9,4).\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,7) and then right to (9,7), then down to (9,4).\n\nWait, but I need to consider the sequence.\n\nMaybe I should just pick one direction and see.\n\nLet me consider moving down to (8,7).\n\nFrom there, I can move right to (9,7), then down to (9,4).\n\nThat's three steps from (8,8) to (9,4):\n\n1. Down to (8,7)\n\n2. Right to (9,7)\n\n3. Down to (9,4)\n\nBut, is there a shorter path?\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (9,8), then down to (9,7), then down to (9,4). That's also three steps.\n\nWait, but moving right to (9,8), then down to (9,4) directly in two steps.\n\nWait, from (9,8) to (9,4) is just down 4 steps, but that's more than one move.\n\nWait, in this game, do we move one step at a time, or can we specify a path?\n\nAssuming we move one step at a time, I need to choose one direction per move.\n\nSo, in this turn, I choose one direction: up, down, left, or right.\n\nThen, in the next turn, I can choose again.\n\nBut I need to think ahead and plan a sequence of moves to reach the apple without hitting anything.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should just move down to (8,7) in this turn, bringing me closer to (9,4).\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move down to (8,7), the enemy"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (0,9). That's the top-left corner, right? Let me confirm: coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. So (0,9) is indeed the top-left.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: 2 (me) and some dots.\n\nRow 8: All dots.\n\nRow 7: All dots.\n\nRow 6: All dots.\n\nRow 5: An apple at (5,5).\n\nRow 4: An apple at (9,4).\n\nRow 3: All dots.\n\nRow 2: An apple at (0,2).\n\nRow 1: Apples at (8,1) and (7,1).\n\nRow 0: An apple at (4,0) and snake 1 at (4,0).\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,0), which is also where there's an apple. Does that mean snake 1 is on top of the apple, or is the apple still there? The board shows a '1' and an 'A' at (4,0), but maybe the '1' is the snake and 'A' is the apple. Hmm, that might be confusing.\n\nAlso, snake 1 has an empty body list, so it's just the head at (4,0). Me too, since I don't see any body parts listed for me.\n\nSo, my position: (0,9)\n\nApples at: (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), (7,1)\n\nEnemy snake at: (4,0)\n\nI need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential risks.\n\nLet me calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (0,9):\n\n1. (0,2): Distance is |0-0| + |9-2| = 0 + 7 = 7 steps.\n\n2. (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\n3. (8,1): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16 steps.\n\n4. (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\n5. (7,1): |0-7| + |9-1| = 7 + 8 = 15 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (0,2), 7 steps away.\n\nBut I should also consider the path to each apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet's visualize the grid:\n\nColumns 0 to 9, rows 0 to 9.\n\nMy position: (0,9)\n\nApple at (0,2): straight down, no obstacles seen in between.\n\nWait, but looking at the board state, row 2 has an 'A' at (0,2). From (0,9) to (0,2), that's moving down 7 rows.\n\nIs there any part of my body in the way? No, since I just started, I only have the head.\n\nSimilarly, is there any other snake in the way? Snake 1 is at (4,0), which is lower right.\n\nSo, path to (0,2): move down 7 steps.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider eating multiple apples in one go.\n\nLet me see: if I go to (0,2), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving right would take me towards (7,1) and (8,1), which are lower down.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up to (9,4), but that's farther.\n\nAlternatively, (5,5) is also an option.\n\nLet me think about a sequence.\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Go to (0,2): 7 steps down.\n\n2. After eating (0,2), I'm longer, so I need to be careful.\n\n3. From (0,2), I can move right to (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (7,1) is 7 steps right and 1 step down.\n\nWait, (7,1) is at column 7, row 1.\n\nFrom (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\nSo, from (0,2):\n\n- Move right 7 steps to (7,2)\n\n- Then down 1 step to (7,1)\n\n- Eat apple at (7,1)\n\n- Now, move right 1 step to (8,1) to eat another apple.\n\nTotal steps from start: 7 (down) + 7 (right) + 1 (down) + 1 (right) = 16 steps.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nOption 2:\n\nGo directly to (5,5):\n\nFrom (0,9) to (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nBut wait, in option 1, it was 16 steps for three apples, while option 2 is 14 steps for two apples.\n\nBut in option 1, I can potentially get three apples in 16 steps, while in option 2, only two in 14 steps.\n\nNot sure, need to think carefully.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Each time I eat an apple, my tail grows.\n\nSo, after eating (0,2), my tail will be longer, and I need to make sure I don't bump into it when making turns.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apples that are closer to each other first.\n\nLooking at the board, apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent.\n\nSo, maybe go to (7,1), eat it, then go to (8,1), eat it, then proceed to another apple.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps\n\n- Then right to (7,1): 7 steps\n\n- Eat (7,1)\n\n- Then right to (8,1): 1 step\n\n- Eat (8,1)\n\n- Now, where to next?

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. So, I'm currently at position (0,9), which is the top-left corner of the board. There are five apples on the board: at (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), and (7,1). There's also an enemy snake at (4,0).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (0,2), which is straight down from my current position. Let's calculate the distance: from (0,9) to (0,2), that's a vertical move down by 7 steps. There don't seem to be any obstacles in that path, so that might be a safe starting point.\n\nBut I also need to think about what to do after eating that apple. After eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have a path that allows me to extend without bumping into myself.\n\nLet me consider the positions after eating (0,2). Once I eat it, my tail will extend, so I need to plan my moves carefully to avoid my own body.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), perhaps I can move right towards the apples at (7,1) and (8,1). From (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1) to eat another apple, and then to (8,1) for the third apple. That seems like a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (5,5) after (0,2). From (0,2), I can move right to (5,2), then up to (5,5). That's another option.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake at (4,0). I don't know how it will move, so I should assume it could potentially block some paths. For now, I'll plan my path away from it initially and see.\n\nLet me also look at the other apples. The apple at (9,4) is quite far away, requiring a move down to (0,4) and then right to (9,4), which is a long path and might not be efficient in the short term.\n\nSimilarly, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are in the lower right area. If I can pick up multiple apples in that area after getting (0,2), that would be ideal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for (0,2), then (7,1), then (8,1). Let's map that out.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 7 + 7 + 1 + 1 = 16 steps.\n\nThat seems manageable. Now, after eating three apples, my snake would be quite long, so I need to ensure that the path doesn't loop back on itself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (0,2), then up to (0,5), then right to (5,5) to get the apple there. But that seems less efficient because (5,5) is farther than (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nWait, from (0,2), moving up to (0,5) is actually moving up 3 steps, then right to (5,5), which is 5 steps right. That's 3 + 5 = 8 steps after the initial 7 steps to (0,2), totaling 15 steps for three apples. Hmm, that might be better.\n\nBut let's see: (0,2) to (0,5): up 3, then right to (5,5): 5 steps. That's a total of 7 + 3 + 5 = 15 steps.\n\nCompared to the previous path of 16 steps, this is shorter. However, I need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board, from (0,2) up to (0,5), then right to (5,5). It seems clear, but I need to make sure that I won't be bumping into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,5), I could then head over to (9,4). From (5,5), right to (9,5), then down to (9,4). That's 4 steps right and 1 step down, totaling 5 steps.\n\nSo, overall steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 3 (up to 0,5) + 5 (right to 5,5) + 4 (right to 9,5) + 1 (down to 9,4) = 7 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 20 steps.\n\nBut wait, after eating (5,5), my snake is longer, so I need to ensure that I can make these moves without hitting my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (5,5), I can go directly down to (5,4), then right to (9,4). That's 1 step down and 4 steps right, totaling 5 steps.\n\nOverall steps: 7 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 4 = still 20 steps.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nLet me consider going for (0,2), then directly to (9,4). From (0,2), right to (9,2), then down to (9,4). That's 9 steps right and 2 steps down, totaling 11 steps after the initial 7 steps, for a total of 18 steps.\n\nBut in this path, I would miss the apples at (7,1) and (8,1), which might not be optimal in terms of points, but it's faster in terms of steps.\n\nI need to balance between maximizing points and minimizing risk.\n\nAlso, I should consider that the enemy snake might be moving and potentially blocking my path.\n\nBut since I don't know its movement pattern, I'll have to plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for the apples that are closer together first, to minimize movement steps and maximize points.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent, so picking them up in sequence would be efficient.\n\nTo reach (7,1), from (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,1): 7 steps.\n\nTotal: 15 steps.\n\nThen, from (7,1), right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 16 steps for two apples.\n\nComparing to the previous path of 18 steps for two apples, this seems better.\n\nAfter that, I can head to (0,2), but that's now at (0,2), which is up left from (8,1). That would require:\n\n- Left to (8,2): 1 step.\n\n- Up to (8,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Left to (0,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\nThat's 1 + 8 + 8 + 7 = 24 steps, which is a lot.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), I could go up to (8,4), then right to (9,4) to get the apple there.\n\nFrom (8,1), up to (8,4): 3 steps.\n\nThen right to (9,4): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 15 (to 7,1) + 1 (to 8,1) + 3 (up to 8,4) + 1 (right to 9,4) = 20 steps for four apples.\n\nThen, finally, go to (5,5). From (9,4), left to (5,4): 4 steps.\n\nThen up to (5,5): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 20 + 4 + 1 = 25 steps for five apples.\n\nThis seems like a possible strategy.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself in these maneuvers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by going for (0,2), then (7,1), (8,1), (9,4), and finally (5,5).\n\nWait, but to get from (8,1) to (9,4), it's right to (9,1), then up to (9,4): 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n\nSo, total steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 7 (right to 7,2) + 1 (down to 7,1) + 1 (right to 8,1) + 1 (right to 9,1) + 3 (up to 9,4) + left to (5,4) + up to (5,5).\n\nWait, that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I need to sketch this out.\n\nLet's try to plan a path:\n\nStart at (0,9).\n\n1. Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n2. Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n3. Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n4. Right to (8,1):"

I should plan paths that don't lead me directly into its area, especially since I don't know its direction.\n\nOption 1: Go for (0,2) first.\n\nFrom (1,9):\n\n- Move left to (0,9)\n\n- Move down to (0,2)\n\nThat's 1 left + 7 downs: total 8 moves.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), my snake will grow, so I need to make sure the next moves don't hit my own tail.\n\nThen, from (0,2), I can aim for other apples.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (5,5) is at (5,5)\n\n- (7,1) is at (7,1)\n\n- (8,1) is at (8,1)\n\n- (9,4) is at (9,4)\n\nFrom (0,2), the closest apple is (5,5):\n\n- |0-5| + |2-5| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\nAlternatively, (7,1):\n\n- |0-7| + |2-1| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n(8,1):\n\n- |0-8| + |2-1| = 8 + 1 = 9\n\n(9,4):\n\n- |0-9| + |2-4| = 9 + 2 = 11\n\nSo, (5,5) and (7,1) are equally close from (0,2).\n\nLet's consider going to (5,5) first.\n\nFrom (0,2):\n\n- Right to (5,2): 5 steps\n\n- Up to (5,5): 3 steps\n\nTotal: 5 + 3 = 8 steps\n\nThen, from (5,5), let's see the next closest apple.\n\nApples left: (7,1), (8,1), (9,4)\n\nFrom (5,5):\n\n- (7,1): |5-7| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6\n\n- (8,1): |5-8| + |5-1| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, (9,4) is the closest from (5,5).\n\nFrom (5,5):\n\n- Right to (9,5): 4 steps\n\n- Down to (9,4): 1 step\n\nTotal: 4 + 1 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (9,4), the remaining apples are (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nFrom (9,4):\n\n- Left to (7,4): 2 steps\n\n- Down to (7,1): 3 steps\n\nTotal: 2 + 3 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (7,1), right to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 1 step\n\nSo, overall steps:\n\n- (1,9) to (0,2): 8 steps\n\n- (0,2) to (5,5): 8 steps\n\n- (5,5) to (9,4): 5 steps\n\n- (9,4) to (7,1): 5 steps\n\n- (7,1) to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal steps: 8 + 8 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 27 steps\n\nBut I need to make sure that my path doesn't cause my snake to collide with itself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlternatively, let's consider going for (5,5) first.\n\nFrom (1,9):\n\n- Down to (1,5): 4 steps\n\n- Right to (5,5): 4 steps\n\nTotal: 4 + 4 = 8 steps\n\nThen, from (5,5):\n\n- Right to (9,5): 4 steps\n\n- Down to (9,4): 1 step\n\nTotal: 4 + 1 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (9,4):\n\n- Left to (7,4): 2 steps\n\n- Down to (7,1): 3 steps\n\nTotal: 2 + 3 = 5 steps\n\nThen, from (7,1):\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 1 step\n\nSo, total steps:\n\n- (1,9) to (5,5): 8 steps\n\n- (5,5) to (9,4): 5 steps\n\n- (9,4) to (7,1): 5 steps\n\n- (7,1) to (8,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 8 + 5 + 5 + 1 = 19 steps\n\nThis seems more efficient than the previous path.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake's position.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1). If I can avoid that area, especially while the enemy might be moving, it's better.\n\nIn this path, I'm going down to (1,5), then right to (5,5), then right to (9,5), down to (9,4), left to (7,4), down to (7,1), and right to (8,1).\n\nThe enemy is at (2,1), which is below my path mostly, so as long as I don't go directly into its position, I should be fine.\n\nBut I need to be cautious, especially when moving down.\n\nAlso, after eating each apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me back to my own tail.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Start at (1,9)\n\n2. Down to (1,5)\n\n3. Right to (5,5)\n\n4. Right to (9,5)\n\n5. Down to (9,4)\n\n6. Left to (7,4)\n\n7. Down to (7,1)\n\n8. Right to (8,1)\n\nAt each step, after eating an apple, my tail extends.\n\nI need to ensure that the next move doesn't step on the new tail positions.\n\nFor example, after eating (5,5), my tail will have grown, so I need to make sure that moving right to (9,5) doesn't cause me to run into my own tail.\n\nSimilarly, after eating (9,4), moving left to (7,4) should be safe, provided I have a long enough path without hitting myself.\n\nThis seems manageable, but I need to be careful.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for the apples that are closer together first to minimize movement.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent, so picking them up in sequence would be efficient.\n\nFrom (1,9):\n\n- Down to (1,1): 8 steps\n\n- Right to (8,1): 7 steps\n\nTotal: 8 + 7 = 15 steps to (8,1)\n\nThen, left to (7,1): 1 step\n\nTotal: 1 step\n\nThen"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (8,8), and I need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right. There are apples at (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), (7,1), and (5,1). Also, there's an enemy snake at (4,5) with its body at (3,5) and (2,5).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to collect as many apples as possible without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or my own body. Since this is a turn-based game, I have to think step by step.\n\nLet me visualize the board. The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. My snake is at (8,8), which is towards the top-right corner.\n\nI should consider the distances to each apple and think about which one to go for first. Let's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- (9,4): |8-9| + |8-4| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- (8,1): |8-8| + |8-1| = 0 + 7 = 7\n\n- (5,5): |8-5| + |8-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- (7,1): |8-7| + |8-1| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n- (5,1): |8-5| + |8-1| = 3 + 7 = 10\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,4) with a distance of 5.\n\nLet me think about moving towards (9,4). From (8,8), I need to go down to (9,8), then left to (9,4). But wait, moving down to (9,8) is okay, but then left to (9,4), I need to make sure there are no obstacles in between.\n\nWait, but looking back at the board state you provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . T T 1 A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . A . A A .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my snake is at (8,8), which is row 8, column 8, and there's an apple at (9,4), which is row 9, column 4.\n\nFrom (8,8), if I go down to (9,8), then left to (9,4), but looking at row 9, it seems empty except for the apple at (9,4). So, that might be a possible path.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake and its possible movements. The enemy is at (4,5) with body at (3,5) and (2,5). I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nMoreover, I need to think about the sequence of picking up apples. Going for the closest one first might not always be the best strategy if it blocks access to others.\n\nLet me consider the positions of all apples:\n\n- (9,4)\n\n- (8,1)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (7,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\nI'm at (8,8). If I go to (9,4), then from there, I can go to (8,1), then to (7,1), then to (5,1), and finally to (5,5). Let's calculate the total distance:\n\n- (8,8) to (9,4): 5\n\n- (9,4) to (8,1): |9-8| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (8,1) to (7,1): 1\n\n- (7,1) to (5,1): 2\n\n- (5,1) to (5,5): 4\n\nTotal steps: 5 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 16\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (5,5) first:\n\n- (8,8) to (5,5): |8-5| + |8-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- (5,5) to (5,1): 4\n\n- (5,1) to (7,1): 2\n\n- (7,1) to (8,1): 1\n\n- (8,1) to (9,4): 5\n\nTotal steps: 6 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 5 = 18\n\nSo, going to (9,4) first seems shorter in terms of steps.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements. The enemy is at (4,5) with body at (3,5) and (2,5). I need to predict where it might be in the future turns.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake is moving somehow, I need to anticipate its path and make sure I don't cross it.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should simplify and just focus on the immediate move.\n\nLooking at my current position (8,8), possible moves are:\n\n- Up to (8,9)\n\n- Down to (9,8)\n\n- Left to (7,8)\n\n- Right to (8,9)\n\nWait, up is (8,9), down is (9,8), left is (7,8), right is (8,9). Wait, up and right both seem to be (8,9), which can't be right.\n\nWait, in this coordinate system, increasing y is up, so up from (8,8) is (8,9), down is (8,7), left is (7,8), right is (9,8).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, from (8,8), possible moves are:\n\n- Up to (8,9)\n\n- Down to (8,7)\n\n- Left to (7,8)\n\n- Right to (9,8)\n\nNow, looking at the board:\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . T T 1 A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . A . A A .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (8,8):\n\n- Up to (8,9): seems empty\n\n- Down to (8,7): seems empty\n\n- Left to (7,8): seems empty\n\n- Right to (9,8): seems empty\n\nAmong these, moving down to (8,7) would bring me closer to the apple at (9,4), but maybe moving right to (9,8) would be better to align with (9,4).\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,7) and then right to (9,7), then down to (9,4).\n\nWait, but I need to consider the sequence.\n\nMaybe I should just pick one direction and see.\n\nLet me consider moving down to (8,7).\n\nFrom there, I can move right to (9,7), then down to (9,4).\n\nThat's three steps from (8,8) to (9,4):\n\n1. Down to (8,7)\n\n2. Right to (9,7)\n\n3. Down to (9,4)\n\nBut, is there a shorter path?\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (9,8), then down to (9,7), then down to (9,4). That's also three steps.\n\nWait, but moving right to (9,8), then down to (9,4) directly in two steps.\n\nWait, from (9,8) to (9,4) is just down 4 steps, but that's more than one move.\n\nWait, in this game, do we move one step at a time, or can we specify a path?\n\nAssuming we move one step at a time, I need to choose one direction per move.\n\nSo, in this turn, I choose one direction: up, down, left, or right.\n\nThen, in the next turn, I can choose again.\n\nBut I need to think ahead and plan a sequence of moves to reach the apple without hitting anything.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should just move down to (8,7) in this turn, bringing me closer to (9,4).\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move down to (8,7), the enemy"

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a decision on which direction to move in this Snake game. Let's recap the situation:\n\n- Board size: 10x10 grid, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\n- Apples are located at (9,4), (8,1), (7,1), (5,1), and (5,8).\n\n- My snake (ID 2) is currently at (8,7).\n\n- There's an enemy snake at (5,5) with its body at (4,5), (3,5), and (2,5).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the positions relative to my current location.\n\nI'm at (8,7). Let's see where everything else is:\n\n- Apple at (9,4): that's one row down and three columns to the left.\n\n- Apple at (8,1): same row, five columns to the left.\n\n- Apple at (7,1): one row up and six columns to the left.\n\n- Apple at (5,1): three rows up and six columns to the left.\n\n- Apple at (5,8): three rows up and no columns left or right.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (5,5) with its body at (4,5), (3,5), and (2,5). So, it's vertically aligned along the y=5 column from x=2 to x=5.\n\nI need to plan a path to collect as many apples as possible without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or my own body.\n\nFirst, let's consider the distances to each apple using Manhattan distance, which is suitable for grid movements.\n\nFrom (8,7):\n\n- To (9,4): |8-9| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- To (8,1): |8-8| + |7-1| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- To (7,1): |8-7| + |7-1| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n- To (5,1): |8-5| + |7-1| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\n- To (5,8): |8-5| + |7-8| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (9,4) and (5,8), both with a distance of 4.\n\nNow, I need to think about which one to go for first. Let's consider the positions:\n\n- (9,4) is down and left.\n\n- (5,8) is up and left.\n\nLooking at the board, moving towards (9,4) might bring me closer to other apples like (8,1), while moving towards (5,8) could lead to (5,1).\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake's position and possible movements.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (5,5) with its body from (2,5) to (5,5). It seems to be vertically aligned along y=5.\n\nI need to be careful not to move into its path or onto its body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps moving towards (9,4) first would be safer, as it's further away from the enemy's current position.\n\nLet's plan a path to (9,4):\n\nFrom (8,7):\n\n1. Move down to (9,7)\n\n2. Move left to (9,4)\n\nThat's two steps.\n\nAfter picking up the apple at (9,4), I can then aim for another apple.\n\nLooking at the next closest apple, (8,1), which is at a distance of |9-8| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4 from (9,4).\n\nSo, from (9,4), I can move:\n\n1. Up to (8,4)\n\n2. Left to (8,1)\n\nThat's two more steps.\n\nTotal steps from starting position to (8,1) would be 4 steps.\n\nThen, from (8,1), I can go to (7,1), which is one step up.\n\nThen to (5,1), which is two steps up.\n\nFinally, to (5,8), which is seven steps to the right.\n\nBut that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, after picking up (9,4) and (8,1), I could go to (5,1), then to (5,8).\n\nWait, but (5,8) is at (5,8), which is three rows up and four columns left from (8,1).\n\nThat would be |8-5| + |1-8| = 3 + 7 = 10 steps.\n\nThat's a long way.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should go for (5,8) first, then to (5,1), then to (7,1), and so on.\n\nLet's think about that.\n\nFrom (8,7):\n\n- To (5,8): |8-5| + |7-8| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nPath:\n\n1. Up to (8,8)\n\n2. Left to (7,8)\n\n3. Left to (6,8)\n\n4. Left to (5,8)\n\nThat's four steps to (5,8).\n\nThen, from (5,8), to (5,1): |5-5| + |8-1| = 0 + 7 = 7 steps to the left.\n\nThen, to (7,1): |5-7| + |1-1| = 2 + 0 = 2 steps down.\n\nThen, to (8,1): |7-8| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1 step down.\n\nFinally, to (9,4): |8-9| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 4 + 7 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 18 steps.\n\nComparing to the previous path: 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 13 steps.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Earlier, I thought the first path was 4 steps to (9,4), then 4 steps to (8,1), then 1 to (7,1), 2 to (5,1), and 7 to (5,8), totaling 18 steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.\n\nLet me recast.\n\nFirst path:\n\n1. (8,7) to (9,4): 4 steps\n\n2. (9,4) to (8,1): 4 steps\n\n3. (8,1) to (7,1): 1 step\n\n4. (7,1) to (5,1): 2 steps\n\n5. (5,1) to (5,8): 7 steps\n\nTotal: 4+4+1+2+7=18 steps\n\nAlternative path:\n\n1. (8,7) to (5,8): 4 steps\n\n2. (5,8) to (5,1): 7 steps\n\n3. (5,1) to (7,1): 2 steps\n\n4. (7,1) to (8,1): 1 step\n\n5. (8,1) to (9,4): 4 steps\n\nTotal: 4+7+2+1+4=18 steps\n\nSo, both paths seem to have the same total steps. Maybe I need to consider other factors, like avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (5,5) with body at (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). It's aligned vertically along y=5 from x=2 to x=5.\n\nIf I go towards (5,8), I'll be moving up to y=8, which is above the enemy's position.\n\nMeanwhile, going towards (9,4) is down and left, away from the enemy.\n\nPerhaps going towards (9,4) first is safer.\n\nAlso, considering the apples' positions, picking (9,4) and then (8,1) makes sense because they are in the same general direction.\n\nAfter that, I can decide whether to go for (7,1), (5,1), or (5,8).\n\nBut I need to think about the sequence that minimizes the total steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider picking the apples in such a way that I don't have to go back and forth.\n\nLet's try to visualize the positions:\n\n- (9,4)\n\n- (8,1)\n\n- (7,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (5,8)\n\nIf I collect them in this order:\n\n1. (9,4)\n\n2. (8,1)\n\n3. (7,1)\n\n4. (5,1)\n\n5. (5,8)\n\nPaths:\n\n- (8,7) to (9,4): down one, left three\n\n- (9,4) to (8,1): up one, left three\n\n- (8,1) to (7,1): up one\n\n- (7,1) to (5,1): up two\n\n- (5,1) to (5,8): right seven\n\nTotal steps: 4 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 7 = 18\n\nAlternative order:\n\n1. (5,8)\n\n2. (5,1)"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (0,9). That's the top-left corner, right? Let me confirm: coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom-left to (9,9) at the top-right. So (0,9) is indeed the top-left.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 9: 2 (me) and some dots.\n\nRow 8: All dots.\n\nRow 7: All dots.\n\nRow 6: All dots.\n\nRow 5: An apple at (5,5).\n\nRow 4: An apple at (9,4).\n\nRow 3: All dots.\n\nRow 2: An apple at (0,2).\n\nRow 1: Apples at (8,1) and (7,1).\n\nRow 0: An apple at (4,0) and snake 1 at (4,0).\n\nWait, snake 1 is at (4,0), which is also where there's an apple. Does that mean snake 1 is on top of the apple, or is the apple still there? The board shows a '1' and an 'A' at (4,0), but maybe the '1' is the snake and 'A' is the apple. Hmm, that might be confusing.\n\nAlso, snake 1 has an empty body list, so it's just the head at (4,0). Me too, since I don't see any body parts listed for me.\n\nSo, my position: (0,9)\n\nApples at: (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), (7,1)\n\nEnemy snake at: (4,0)\n\nI need to plan my moves to eat as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should think about which apple to go for first. There are five apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and potential risks.\n\nLet me calculate the distances to each apple from my current position (0,9):\n\n1. (0,2): Distance is |0-0| + |9-2| = 0 + 7 = 7 steps.\n\n2. (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\n3. (8,1): |0-8| + |9-1| = 8 + 8 = 16 steps.\n\n4. (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\n5. (7,1): |0-7| + |9-1| = 7 + 8 = 15 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (0,2), 7 steps away.\n\nBut I should also consider the path to each apple and potential obstacles.\n\nLet's visualize the grid:\n\nColumns 0 to 9, rows 0 to 9.\n\nMy position: (0,9)\n\nApple at (0,2): straight down, no obstacles seen in between.\n\nWait, but looking at the board state, row 2 has an 'A' at (0,2). From (0,9) to (0,2), that's moving down 7 rows.\n\nIs there any part of my body in the way? No, since I just started, I only have the head.\n\nSimilarly, is there any other snake in the way? Snake 1 is at (4,0), which is lower right.\n\nSo, path to (0,2): move down 7 steps.\n\nThat seems straightforward.\n\nBut maybe I should consider eating multiple apples in one go.\n\nLet me see: if I go to (0,2), I'll grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't bump into myself.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), I can consider moving right or left to reach other apples.\n\nWait, but moving right would take me towards (7,1) and (8,1), which are lower down.\n\nAlternatively, I could move up to (9,4), but that's farther.\n\nAlternatively, (5,5) is also an option.\n\nLet me think about a sequence.\n\nOption 1:\n\n1. Go to (0,2): 7 steps down.\n\n2. After eating (0,2), I'm longer, so I need to be careful.\n\n3. From (0,2), I can move right to (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nBut moving right from (0,2) to (7,1) is 7 steps right and 1 step down.\n\nWait, (7,1) is at column 7, row 1.\n\nFrom (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1).\n\nSo, from (0,2):\n\n- Move right 7 steps to (7,2)\n\n- Then down 1 step to (7,1)\n\n- Eat apple at (7,1)\n\n- Now, move right 1 step to (8,1) to eat another apple.\n\nTotal steps from start: 7 (down) + 7 (right) + 1 (down) + 1 (right) = 16 steps.\n\nBut is there a shorter path?\n\nOption 2:\n\nGo directly to (5,5):\n\nFrom (0,9) to (5,5): |0-5| + |9-5| = 5 + 4 = 9 steps.\n\nThen from (5,5) to (9,4): |5-9| + |5-4| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nBut wait, in option 1, it was 16 steps for three apples, while option 2 is 14 steps for two apples.\n\nBut in option 1, I can potentially get three apples in 16 steps, while in option 2, only two in 14 steps.\n\nNot sure, need to think carefully.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the growth of my snake. Each time I eat an apple, my tail grows.\n\nSo, after eating (0,2), my tail will be longer, and I need to make sure I don't bump into it when making turns.\n\nThis complicates things.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for the apples that are closer to each other first.\n\nLooking at the board, apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent.\n\nSo, maybe go to (7,1), eat it, then go to (8,1), eat it, then proceed to another apple.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps\n\n- Then right to (7,1): 7 steps\n\n- Eat (7,1)\n\n- Then right to (8,1): 1 step\n\n- Eat (8,1)\n\n- Now, where to next? (0,2), (5,5), or (9,4).\n\nFrom (8,1), to (5,5): |8-5| + |1-5| = 3 + 4 = 7 steps.\n\nTotal steps so far: 8 + 7 + 1 + 7 = 23 steps.\n\nThat seems too many.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), go up to (8,9), then left to (0,9), then down to (0,2), etc.\n\nBut that would be a very long detour.\n\nMaybe not efficient.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider the apple at (9,4).\n\nFrom (0,9), going to (9,4): |0-9| + |9-4| = 9 + 5 = 14 steps.\n\nThen from (9,4), I can go left to (5,4), then up to (5,5) to eat the apple there.\n\nBut (5,5) is at (5,5), so from (9,4), to (5,5): |9-5| + |4-5| = 4 + 1 = 5 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 14 + 5 = 19 steps.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's the best path.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nEnemy snake is at (4,0), and it's just the head, no body.\n\nI need to make sure I don't collide with it.\n\nI don't know how the enemy snake will move, so I should assume it could move in any direction.\n\nBut for now, I'll plan my path assuming it stays put or moves in a way that doesn't block me.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to predict its movement based on the apple positions.\n\nBut perhaps that's too complicated for now.\n\nI need to make a decision for my next move.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by moving down towards the closest apple at (0,2).\n\nFrom (0,9), moving down to (0,2) is a straight path with no obstacles.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll choose to move down.\n\nBut wait, I need to specify left, right, up, or down.\n\nIn terms of coordinates:\n\n- Down corresponds to decreasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Up corresponds to increasing y-coordinate.\n\n- Left corresponds to decreasing x-coordinate.\n\n- Right corresponds to increasing x-coordinate.\n\nSo, to move down from (0,9) to (0,8), I should choose down.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, my next"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out my next move in this Snake game. So, I'm currently at position (0,9), which is the top-left corner of the board. There are five apples on the board: at (0,2), (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), and (7,1). There's also an enemy snake at (4,0).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. The closest apple seems to be at (0,2), which is straight down from my current position. Let's calculate the distance: from (0,9) to (0,2), that's a vertical move down by 7 steps. There don't seem to be any obstacles in that path, so that might be a safe starting point.\n\nBut I also need to think about what to do after eating that apple. After eating an apple, my snake grows, so I need to make sure that I have a path that allows me to extend without bumping into myself.\n\nLet me consider the positions after eating (0,2). Once I eat it, my tail will extend, so I need to plan my moves carefully to avoid my own body.\n\nAfter eating (0,2), perhaps I can move right towards the apples at (7,1) and (8,1). From (0,2), moving right to (7,2), then down to (7,1) to eat another apple, and then to (8,1) for the third apple. That seems like a possible path.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for the apple at (5,5) after (0,2). From (0,2), I can move right to (5,2), then up to (5,5). That's another option.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake at (4,0). I don't know how it will move, so I should assume it could potentially block some paths. For now, I'll plan my path away from it initially and see.\n\nLet me also look at the other apples. The apple at (9,4) is quite far away, requiring a move down to (0,4) and then right to (9,4), which is a long path and might not be efficient in the short term.\n\nSimilarly, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are in the lower right area. If I can pick up multiple apples in that area after getting (0,2), that would be ideal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for (0,2), then (7,1), then (8,1). Let's map that out.\n\nFrom (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n- Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n- Right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal steps: 7 + 7 + 1 + 1 = 16 steps.\n\nThat seems manageable. Now, after eating three apples, my snake would be quite long, so I need to ensure that the path doesn't loop back on itself.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider going for (0,2), then up to (0,5), then right to (5,5) to get the apple there. But that seems less efficient because (5,5) is farther than (7,1) and (8,1).\n\nWait, from (0,2), moving up to (0,5) is actually moving up 3 steps, then right to (5,5), which is 5 steps right. That's 3 + 5 = 8 steps after the initial 7 steps to (0,2), totaling 15 steps for three apples. Hmm, that might be better.\n\nBut let's see: (0,2) to (0,5): up 3, then right to (5,5): 5 steps. That's a total of 7 + 3 + 5 = 15 steps.\n\nCompared to the previous path of 16 steps, this is shorter. However, I need to check if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nLooking at the board, from (0,2) up to (0,5), then right to (5,5). It seems clear, but I need to make sure that I won't be bumping into myself or the enemy snake.\n\nAlso, after eating (5,5), I could then head over to (9,4). From (5,5), right to (9,5), then down to (9,4). That's 4 steps right and 1 step down, totaling 5 steps.\n\nSo, overall steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 3 (up to 0,5) + 5 (right to 5,5) + 4 (right to 9,5) + 1 (down to 9,4) = 7 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 1 = 20 steps.\n\nBut wait, after eating (5,5), my snake is longer, so I need to ensure that I can make these moves without hitting my own tail.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps from (5,5), I can go directly down to (5,4), then right to (9,4). That's 1 step down and 4 steps right, totaling 5 steps.\n\nOverall steps: 7 + 3 + 5 + 1 + 4 = still 20 steps.\n\nHmm, maybe there's a more efficient way.\n\nLet me consider going for (0,2), then directly to (9,4). From (0,2), right to (9,2), then down to (9,4). That's 9 steps right and 2 steps down, totaling 11 steps after the initial 7 steps, for a total of 18 steps.\n\nBut in this path, I would miss the apples at (7,1) and (8,1), which might not be optimal in terms of points, but it's faster in terms of steps.\n\nI need to balance between maximizing points and minimizing risk.\n\nAlso, I should consider that the enemy snake might be moving and potentially blocking my path.\n\nBut since I don't know its movement pattern, I'll have to plan assuming it could move in any direction.\n\nPerhaps a better strategy is to go for the apples that are closer together first, to minimize movement steps and maximize points.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples at (7,1) and (8,1) are adjacent, so picking them up in sequence would be efficient.\n\nTo reach (7,1), from (0,9):\n\n- Down to (0,1): 8 steps.\n\n- Right to (7,1): 7 steps.\n\nTotal: 15 steps.\n\nThen, from (7,1), right to (8,1): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 16 steps for two apples.\n\nComparing to the previous path of 18 steps for two apples, this seems better.\n\nAfter that, I can head to (0,2), but that's now at (0,2), which is up left from (8,1). That would require:\n\n- Left to (8,2): 1 step.\n\n- Up to (8,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Left to (0,9): 8 steps.\n\n- Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\nThat's 1 + 8 + 8 + 7 = 24 steps, which is a lot.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,1), I could go up to (8,4), then right to (9,4) to get the apple there.\n\nFrom (8,1), up to (8,4): 3 steps.\n\nThen right to (9,4): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 15 (to 7,1) + 1 (to 8,1) + 3 (up to 8,4) + 1 (right to 9,4) = 20 steps for four apples.\n\nThen, finally, go to (5,5). From (9,4), left to (5,4): 4 steps.\n\nThen up to (5,5): 1 step.\n\nTotal: 20 + 4 + 1 = 25 steps for five apples.\n\nThis seems like a possible strategy.\n\nBut I need to make sure that my snake doesn't collide with itself in these maneuvers.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should start by going for (0,2), then (7,1), (8,1), (9,4), and finally (5,5).\n\nWait, but to get from (8,1) to (9,4), it's right to (9,1), then up to (9,4): 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n\nSo, total steps: 7 (to 0,2) + 7 (right to 7,2) + 1 (down to 7,1) + 1 (right to 8,1) + 1 (right to 9,1) + 3 (up to 9,4) + left to (5,4) + up to (5,5).\n\nWait, that seems a bit convoluted.\n\nMaybe I need to sketch this out.\n\nLet's try to plan a path:\n\nStart at (0,9).\n\n1. Down to (0,2): 7 steps.\n\n2. Right to (7,2): 7 steps.\n\n3. Down to (7,1): 1 step.\n\n4. Right to (8,1):"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, my snake is at position (8,8), and I need to choose a direction: up, down, left, or right. There are apples at (9,4), (8,1), (5,5), (7,1), and (5,1). Also, there's an enemy snake at (4,5) with its body at (3,5) and (2,5).\n\nI need to plan a path that allows me to collect as many apples as possible without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or my own body. Since this is a turn-based game, I have to think step by step.\n\nLet me visualize the board. The board is 10x10, with (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. My snake is at (8,8), which is towards the top-right corner.\n\nI should consider the distances to each apple and think about which one to go for first. Let's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- (9,4): |8-9| + |8-4| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\n- (8,1): |8-8| + |8-1| = 0 + 7 = 7\n\n- (5,5): |8-5| + |8-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- (7,1): |8-7| + |8-1| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n- (5,1): |8-5| + |8-1| = 3 + 7 = 10\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,4) with a distance of 5.\n\nLet me think about moving towards (9,4). From (8,8), I need to go down to (9,8), then left to (9,4). But wait, moving down to (9,8) is okay, but then left to (9,4), I need to make sure there are no obstacles in between.\n\nWait, but looking back at the board state you provided:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . T T 1 A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . A . A A .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns 0 to 9.\n\nSo, my snake is at (8,8), which is row 8, column 8, and there's an apple at (9,4), which is row 9, column 4.\n\nFrom (8,8), if I go down to (9,8), then left to (9,4), but looking at row 9, it seems empty except for the apple at (9,4). So, that might be a possible path.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake and its possible movements. The enemy is at (4,5) with body at (3,5) and (2,5). I need to make sure I don't run into it.\n\nMoreover, I need to think about the sequence of picking up apples. Going for the closest one first might not always be the best strategy if it blocks access to others.\n\nLet me consider the positions of all apples:\n\n- (9,4)\n\n- (8,1)\n\n- (5,5)\n\n- (7,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\nI'm at (8,8). If I go to (9,4), then from there, I can go to (8,1), then to (7,1), then to (5,1), and finally to (5,5). Let's calculate the total distance:\n\n- (8,8) to (9,4): 5\n\n- (9,4) to (8,1): |9-8| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- (8,1) to (7,1): 1\n\n- (7,1) to (5,1): 2\n\n- (5,1) to (5,5): 4\n\nTotal steps: 5 + 4 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 16\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (5,5) first:\n\n- (8,8) to (5,5): |8-5| + |8-5| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- (5,5) to (5,1): 4\n\n- (5,1) to (7,1): 2\n\n- (7,1) to (8,1): 1\n\n- (8,1) to (9,4): 5\n\nTotal steps: 6 + 4 + 2 + 1 + 5 = 18\n\nSo, going to (9,4) first seems shorter in terms of steps.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's possible movements. The enemy is at (4,5) with body at (3,5) and (2,5). I need to predict where it might be in the future turns.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake is moving somehow, I need to anticipate its path and make sure I don't cross it.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should simplify and just focus on the immediate move.\n\nLooking at my current position (8,8), possible moves are:\n\n- Up to (8,9)\n\n- Down to (9,8)\n\n- Left to (7,8)\n\n- Right to (8,9)\n\nWait, up is (8,9), down is (9,8), left is (7,8), right is (8,9). Wait, up and right both seem to be (8,9), which can't be right.\n\nWait, in this coordinate system, increasing y is up, so up from (8,8) is (8,9), down is (8,7), left is (7,8), right is (9,8).\n\nYes, that makes sense.\n\nSo, from (8,8), possible moves are:\n\n- Up to (8,9)\n\n- Down to (8,7)\n\n- Left to (7,8)\n\n- Right to (9,8)\n\nNow, looking at the board:\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . 2\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . T T 1 A . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . A\n\nRow 3: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . A . A A .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nSo, from (8,8):\n\n- Up to (8,9): seems empty\n\n- Down to (8,7): seems empty\n\n- Left to (7,8): seems empty\n\n- Right to (9,8): seems empty\n\nAmong these, moving down to (8,7) would bring me closer to the apple at (9,4), but maybe moving right to (9,8) would be better to align with (9,4).\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (8,7) and then right to (9,7), then down to (9,4).\n\nWait, but I need to consider the sequence.\n\nMaybe I should just pick one direction and see.\n\nLet me consider moving down to (8,7).\n\nFrom there, I can move right to (9,7), then down to (9,4).\n\nThat's three steps from (8,8) to (9,4):\n\n1. Down to (8,7)\n\n2. Right to (9,7)\n\n3. Down to (9,4)\n\nBut, is there a shorter path?\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (9,8), then down to (9,7), then down to (9,4). That's also three steps.\n\nWait, but moving right to (9,8), then down to (9,4) directly in two steps.\n\nWait, from (9,8) to (9,4) is just down 4 steps, but that's more than one move.\n\nWait, in this game, do we move one step at a time, or can we specify a path?\n\nAssuming we move one step at a time, I need to choose one direction per move.\n\nSo, in this turn, I choose one direction: up, down, left, or right.\n\nThen, in the next turn, I can choose again.\n\nBut I need to think ahead and plan a sequence of moves to reach the apple without hitting anything.\n\nGiven that, perhaps I should just move down to (8,7) in this turn, bringing me closer to (9,4).\n\nBut let's think about potential risks.\n\nIf I move down to (8,7), the enemy"

Let's recap the situation:\n\n- Board size: 10x10 grid, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\n- Apples are located at (9,4), (8,1), (7,1), (5,1), and (5,8).\n\n- My snake (ID 2) is currently at (8,7).\n\n- There's an enemy snake at (5,5) with its body at (4,5), (3,5), and (2,5).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the positions relative to my current location.\n\nI'm at (8,7). Let's see where everything else is:\n\n- Apple at (9,4): that's one row down and three columns to the left.\n\n- Apple at (8,1): same row, five columns to the left.\n\n- Apple at (7,1): one row up and six columns to the left.\n\n- Apple at (5,1): three rows up and six columns to the left.\n\n- Apple at (5,8): three rows up and no columns left or right.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (5,5) with its body at (4,5), (3,5), and (2,5). So, it's vertically aligned along the y=5 column from x=2 to x=5.\n\nI need to plan a path to collect as many apples as possible without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or my own body.\n\nFirst, let's consider the distances to each apple using Manhattan distance, which is suitable for grid movements.\n\nFrom (8,7):\n\n- To (9,4): |8-9| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- To (8,1): |8-8| + |7-1| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- To (7,1): |8-7| + |7-1| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n- To (5,1): |8-5| + |7-1| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\n- To (5,8): |8-5| + |7-8| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (9,4) and (5,8), both with a distance of 4.\n\nNow, I need to think about which one to go for first. Let's consider the positions:\n\n- (9,4) is down and left.\n\n- (5,8) is up and left.\n\nLooking at the board, moving towards (9,4) might bring me closer to other apples like (8,1), while moving towards (5,8) could lead to (5,1).\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake's position and possible movements.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (5,5) with its body from (2,5) to (5,5). It seems to be vertically aligned along y=5.\n\nI need to be careful not to move into its path or onto its body.\n\nGiven that, perhaps moving towards (9,4) first would be safer, as it's further away from the enemy's current position.\n\nLet's plan a path to (9,4):\n\nFrom (8,7):\n\n1. Move down to (9,7)\n\n2. Move left to (9,4)\n\nThat's two steps.\n\nAfter picking up the apple at (9,4), I can then aim for another apple.\n\nLooking at the next closest apple, (8,1), which is at a distance of |9-8| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4 from (9,4).\n\nSo, from (9,4), I can move:\n\n1. Up to (8,4)\n\n2. Left to (8,1)\n\nThat's two more steps.\n\nTotal steps from starting position to (8,1) would be 4 steps.\n\nThen, from (8,1), I can go to (7,1), which is one step up.\n\nThen to (5,1), which is two steps up.\n\nFinally, to (5,8), which is seven steps to the right.\n\nBut that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, after picking up (9,4) and (8,1), I could go to (5,1), then to (5,8).\n\nWait, but (5,8) is at (5,8), which is three rows up and four columns left from (8,1).\n\nThat would be |8-5| + |1-8| = 3 + 7 = 10 steps.\n\nThat's a long way.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different order.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should go for (5,8) first, then to (5,1), then to (7,1), and so on.\n\nLet's think about that.\n\nFrom (8,7):\n\n- To (5,8): |8-5| + |7-8| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\nPath:\n\n1. Up to (8,8)\n\n2. Left to (7,8)\n\n3. Left to (6,8)\n\n4. Left to (5,8)\n\nThat's four steps to (5,8).\n\nThen, from (5,8), to (5,1): |5-5| + |8-1| = 0 + 7 = 7 steps to the left.\n\nThen, to (7,1): |5-7| + |1-1| = 2 + 0 = 2 steps down.\n\nThen, to (8,1): |7-8| + |1-1| = 1 + 0 = 1 step down.\n\nFinally, to (9,4): |8-9| + |1-4| = 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 4 + 7 + 2 + 1 + 4 = 18 steps.\n\nComparing to the previous path: 2 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 4 = 13 steps.\n\nWait, that doesn't add up. Earlier, I thought the first path was 4 steps to (9,4), then 4 steps to (8,1), then 1 to (7,1), 2 to (5,1), and 7 to (5,8), totaling 18 steps.\n\nWait, perhaps I miscalculated earlier.\n\nLet me recast.\n\nFirst path:\n\n1. (8,7) to (9,4): 4 steps\n\n2. (9,4) to (8,1): 4 steps\n\n3. (8,1) to (7,1): 1 step\n\n4. (7,1) to (5,1): 2 steps\n\n5. (5,1) to (5,8): 7 steps\n\nTotal: 4+4+1+2+7=18 steps\n\nAlternative path:\n\n1. (8,7) to (5,8): 4 steps\n\n2. (5,8) to (5,1): 7 steps\n\n3. (5,1) to (7,1): 2 steps\n\n4. (7,1) to (8,1): 1 step\n\n5. (8,1) to (9,4): 4 steps\n\nTotal: 4+7+2+1+4=18 steps\n\nSo, both paths seem to have the same total steps. Maybe I need to consider other factors, like avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (5,5) with body at (4,5), (3,5), (2,5). It's aligned vertically along y=5 from x=2 to x=5.\n\nIf I go towards (5,8), I'll be moving up to y=8, which is above the enemy's position.\n\nMeanwhile, going towards (9,4) is down and left, away from the enemy.\n\nPerhaps going towards (9,4) first is safer.\n\nAlso, considering the apples' positions, picking (9,4) and then (8,1) makes sense because they are in the same general direction.\n\nAfter that, I can decide whether to go for (7,1), (5,1), or (5,8).\n\nBut I need to think about the sequence that minimizes the total steps.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider picking the apples in such a way that I don't have to go back and forth.\n\nLet's try to visualize the positions:\n\n- (9,4)\n\n- (8,1)\n\n- (7,1)\n\n- (5,1)\n\n- (5,8)\n\nIf I collect them in this order:\n\n1.

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a decision on which direction to move in this Snake game. Let's recap the situation:\n\n- Board size: 10x10 grid, with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\n- Apples are located at (9,4), (8,1), (7,1), (5,1), and (5,8).\n\n- My snake (ID 2) is currently at (9,7).\n\n- There's an enemy snake at (5,6) with its body at (5,5), (4,5), (3,5).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the positions relative to my current location.\n\nI'm at (9,7). Let's see where everything else is:\n\n- Apple at (9,4): that's zero rows down and three columns to the left.\n\n- Apple at (8,1): one row up and six columns to the left.\n\n- Apple at (7,1): two rows up and six columns to the left.\n\n- Apple at (5,1): four rows up and six columns to the left.\n\n- Apple at (5,8): four rows up and one column to the left.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (5,6) with its body at (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). So, it's mostly along the y=5 row from x=3 to x=5.\n\nI need to plan a path to collect as many apples as possible without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or my own body.\n\nFirst, let's consider the distances to each apple using Manhattan distance, which is suitable for grid movements.\n\nFrom (9,7):\n\n- To (9,4): |9-9| + |7-4| = 0 + 3 = 3\n\n- To (8,1): |9-8| + |7-1| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n- To (7,1): |9-7| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- To (5,1): |9-5| + |7-1| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- To (5,8): |9-5| + |7-8| = 4 + 1 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (9,4) with a distance of 3, followed by (5,8) at 5, then (8,1) at 7, and so on.\n\nNow, I need to think about which one to go for first. Let's consider the positions:\n\n- (9,4) is directly left.\n\n- (5,8) is up and left.\n\nLooking at the board, moving towards (9,4) seems straightforward and doesn't bring me close to the enemy snake immediately.\n\nMoving towards (5,8) would require moving up and left, which could potentially put me in the path of the enemy snake.\n\nGiven that, perhaps moving towards (9,4) first would be safer.\n\nLet's plan a path to (9,4):\n\nFrom (9,7):\n\n1. Move left to (9,6)\n\n2. Move left to (9,5)\n\n3. Move left to (9,4)\n\nThat's three steps.\n\nAfter picking up the apple at (9,4), I can then aim for another apple.\n\nLooking at the next closest apple, (5,8), which is at a distance of |9-5| + |4-8| = 4 + 4 = 8 from (9,4).\n\nSo, from (9,4), I can move:\n\n1. Up to (8,4)\n\n2. Up to (7,4)\n\n3. Up to (6,4)\n\n4. Up to (5,4)\n\n5. Right to (5,5)\n\n6. Right to (5,6)\n\n7. Right to (5,7)\n\n8. Right to (5,8)\n\nThat's eight steps.\n\nTotal steps from starting position to (5,8) would be 3 + 8 = 11 steps.\n\nThen, from (5,8), I can go to (5,1), which is seven steps down.\n\nThen to (7,1), which is two steps up.\n\nThen to (8,1), which is one step up.\n\nFinally, to (9,4), which is three steps down and three steps right.\n\nBut that seems inefficient.\n\nAlternatively, after picking up (9,4), I could go for (8,1), which is |9-8| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4 steps.\n\nPath:\n\nFrom (9,4):\n\n1. Up to (8,4)\n\n2. Left to (8,3)\n\n3. Left to (8,2)\n\n4. Left to (8,1)\n\nThen, from (8,1), go to (7,1): up one step.\n\nThen to (5,1): up two steps.\n\nFinally, to (5,8): right seven steps.\n\nTotal steps: 3 (to 9,4) + 4 (to 8,1) + 1 (to 7,1) + 2 (to 5,1) + 7 (to 5,8) = 17 steps.\n\nComparing to the previous path of 11 steps to (5,8) and then further steps, this seems more efficient.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy snake's movements.\n\nThe enemy snake is at (5,6) with its body at (5,5), (4,5), (3,5). It might be moving up or down.\n\nI need to avoid moving into its path.\n\nGiven that, perhaps moving towards (9,4) first is safer, as it's closer and away from the enemy.\n\nAfter picking up (9,4), I can then decide based on the enemy's position.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (5,8) directly from my current position.\n\nFrom (9,7):\n\n1. Up to (8,7)\n\n2. Up to (7,7)\n\n3. Up to (6,7)\n\n4. Up to (5,7)\n\n5. Right to (5,8)\n\nThat's five steps.\n\nBut (5,8) is at a distance of 5 steps directly, which matches the earlier calculation.\n\nHowever, moving up towards (5,8) might bring me closer to the enemy snake, which is at (5,6).\n\nI need to be cautious not to collide with the enemy.\n\nGiven that, perhaps it's safer to go for (9,4) first.\n\nLet's consider potential risks.\n\nIf I move towards (9,4):\n\n- Path: left to (9,6), left to (9,5), left to (9,4)\n\nDuring this movement, I'm moving left along the bottom row, away from the enemy.\n\nThis seems safe.\n\nAfter picking up (9,4), I can then decide to move up towards (8,1), which is at (8,1).\n\nFrom (9,4):\n\n- Up to (8,4)\n\n- Up to (7,4)\n\n- Left to (7,3)\n\n- Left to (7,2)\n\n- Left to (7,1)\n\n- Left to (6,1)\n\n- Left to (5,1)\n\n- Left to (4,1)\n\n- Left to (3,1)\n\n- Left to (2,1)\n\n- Left to (1,1)\n\n- Left to (0,1)\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense. I must have miscalculated.\n\nFrom (9,4) to (8,1):\n\n- Up to (8,4)\n\n- Left to (8,3)\n\n- Left to (8,2)\n\n- Left to (8,1)\n\nThat's three steps.\n\nTotal steps from start to (8,1): 3 (to 9,4) + 3 (to 8,1) = 6 steps.\n\nThen, from (8,1) to (7,1): up one step.\n\nTotal: 7 steps.\n\nThen to (5,1): up two steps.\n\nTotal: 9 steps.\n\nThen to (5,8): right seven steps.\n\nTotal: 16 steps.\n\nThis seems better than the earlier path.\n\nAlternatively, after picking up (9,4), I could go to (5,8):\n\nFrom (9,4):\n\n- Up to (8,4)\n\n- Up to (7,4)\n\n- Up to (6,4)\n\n- Up to (5,4)\n\n- Right to (5,5)\n\n- Right to (5,6)\n\n- Right to (5,7)\n\n- Right to (5,8)\n\nThat's eight steps.\n\nTotal from start: 3 + 8 = 11 steps.\n\nThen, from (5,8) to (5,1): left seven steps.\n\nTotal: 18 steps.\n\nSo, going to (8,1) first is more efficient.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's position.\n\nThe enemy is at (5,6), and its body is at (5,5), (4,5), (3,5).\n\nIf I move up towards (5,8), I might collide with the enemy if it moves up.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left towards (9,4), I'm moving away from the enemy.\n\nAfter picking up (9,4), I can then move up towards (8,1), which is still moving away from the enemy.\n\nThis seems safer.\n\nAlso, considering that (8"
