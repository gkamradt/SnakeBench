If I try to plan my path to maximize my points, I should also keep in mind that I have to avoid running into walls or the enemy snake.\n\nTo consider potential moves:\n- **Move UP (to (4, 8)):** Would be off the board and thus risky (invalid move).\n- **Move DOWN (to (4, 6)):** This space is free and keeps me in the game, but there's no apple there.\n- **Move LEFT (to (3, 7)):** This space is also free and retains my position in the game, keeping options open.\n- **Move RIGHT (to (5, 7)):** This space is free, maintaining my position, but similar to UP and DOWN, does not bring me any closer to an apple directly.\n\nSince my last move was none and I'm looking for a strategy that gains me points without risking running into a wall or the enemy snake, I'll focus on moving towards the direction where I can either have a chance at an apple in the future or safely reposition myself.\n\nMoving down to (4, 6) keeps me central where I can subsequently make a move toward left and potentially toward the apple at (2, 5) in future turns.\n\nSo, I decide to move DOWN to (4, 6).\n\nNext move: DOWN."
