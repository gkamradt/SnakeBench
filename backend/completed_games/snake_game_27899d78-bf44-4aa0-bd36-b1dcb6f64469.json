Collecting this apple will allow my snake to grow and gain an additional point.\n- **DOWN (7, 1):** The cell is empty and safe, but it doesn't bring me closer to any apples.\n- **LEFT (6, 2):** Moving left brings me closer to the apple at (5, 2), positioning me strategically for future moves.\n- **RIGHT (8, 2):** This would mean reversing my last move, which could lead to self-collision, especially if my snake has more than one segment.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- **Immediate Gain:** Moving **UP** allows me to collect an apple right away, which is beneficial for growth and scoring.\n- **Future Positioning:** While moving **LEFT** positions me closer to another apple, prioritizing immediate gains can often lead to better long-term positioning by freeing up space.\n- **Avoiding Hazards:** Moving **RIGHT** poses a risk of self-collision, which should be avoided to ensure survival.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\nAfter collecting the apple by moving **UP**, I should assess the remaining apples and position myself to access them efficiently while avoiding potential traps or enemy snakes.\n\n**Next Move:**\n**UP**"
