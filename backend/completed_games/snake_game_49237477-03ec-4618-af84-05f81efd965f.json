However, moving down does not present any immediate threats.\n\n- **Opportunity:**  \n  Moving down takes me closer to the lower boundary of the board, moving away from the cluster of apples. This direction does not align with my current apple-centric strategy and offers minimal strategic advantage.\n\n---\n\n### **Decision:**\n\n- **LEFT** is the most strategic and safe move. It advances my position towards the apple at **(1, 3)**, allowing me to collect it within the next few moves. This aligns well with my strategy of targeting nearby apples to maximize point gains efficiently.\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n- **Proceed Towards (1, 3):** After moving left, prioritize moving up twice to consume the apple at **(1, 3)**. This will set me up to target the apple at **(0, 4)** subsequently.\n\n- **Maintain Flexibility:** Ensure that each move keeps multiple pathways open to prevent getting trapped as more apples are collected and the snake grows in length.\n\n- **Monitor Enemy Positions:** Continue to observe the enemy snake's movements to avoid potential collisions, especially as both snakes navigate towards areas with multiple apples.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

The enemy snake #2 is at (0, 4) with its body occupying (0, 3), (1, 3), and (1, 2).\n\n### Immediate Goals:\n1. **Safety First**: I need to avoid the segment of the enemy snake, particularly the area around (1, 3), as this part of their body signifies a dangerous proximity.\n2. **Next Apple Move**: The closest apple for me to reach is at (2, 6). However, moving to (2, 6) presents certain risks if the enemy snake moves in my direction as well.\n\n### Possible Moves from (4, 6):\n1. **UP to (4, 7)**: Valid move, but does not progress towards any apples.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 5)**: This would bring me back to my previous position, which is not advisable.\n3. **LEFT to (3, 6)**: This would also bring me back to my previous position, which is not advisable.\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 6)**: Valid move, but will not advance towards any apples.\n\n### Evaluating Benefits:\n- **UP to (4, 7)** does not yield any immediate gains but positions me slightly higher on the board, potentially opening up new moves on the next turn.\n- Both **LEFT** and **DOWN** are not options as they map back to my previous location.\n- **RIGHT to (5, 6)** holds no immediate advantage since no apple can be collected.\n\n### Long-term Strategy:\n- I need to think a couple of moves ahead. If I consider an eventual goal of reaching apples, the move UP to (4, 7) ensures I stay safe for another turn while still keeping other options available.\n- The strategy should favor upward movements as they allow broader access to apple rows above, while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that my immediate options don\u2019t seem to lead to immediate apple collection and also considering not backtracking is crucial\u2014moving **UP to (4, 7)** is the most strategic choice for now.\n\nNext move: UP."

However, moving to (2, 6) presents certain risks if the enemy snake moves in my direction as well.\n\n### Possible Moves from (4, 6):\n1. **UP to (4, 7)**: Valid move, but does not progress towards any apples.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 5)**: This would bring me back to my previous position, which is not advisable.\n3. **LEFT to (3, 6)**: This would also bring me back to my previous position, which is not advisable.\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 6)**: Valid move, but will not advance towards any apples.\n\n### Evaluating Benefits:\n- **UP to (4, 7)** does not yield any immediate gains but positions me slightly higher on the board, potentially opening up new moves on the next turn.\n- Both **LEFT** and **DOWN** are not options as they map back to my previous location.\n- **RIGHT to (5, 6)** holds no immediate advantage since no apple can be collected.\n\n### Long-term Strategy:\n- I need to think a couple of moves ahead. If I consider an eventual goal of reaching apples, the move UP to (4, 7) ensures I stay safe for another turn while still keeping other options available.\n- The strategy should favor upward movements as they allow broader access to apple rows above, while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that my immediate options don\u2019t seem to lead to immediate apple collection and also considering not backtracking is crucial\u2014moving **UP to (4, 7)** is the most strategic choice for now.\n\nNext move: UP."

However, moving to (2, 6) presents certain risks if the enemy snake moves in my direction as well.\n\n### Possible Moves from (4, 6):\n1. **UP to (4, 7)**: Valid move, but does not progress towards any apples.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 5)**: This would bring me back to my previous position, which is not advisable.\n3. **LEFT to (3, 6)**: This would also bring me back to my previous position, which is not advisable.\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 6)**: Valid move, but will not advance towards any apples.\n\n### Evaluating Benefits:\n- **UP to (4, 7)** does not yield any immediate gains but positions me slightly higher on the board, potentially opening up new moves on the next turn.\n- Both **LEFT** and **DOWN** are not options as they map back to my previous location.\n- **RIGHT to (5, 6)** holds no immediate advantage since no apple can be collected.\n\n### Long-term Strategy:\n- I need to think a couple of moves ahead. If I consider an eventual goal of reaching apples, the move UP to (4, 7) ensures I stay safe for another turn while still keeping other options available.\n- The strategy should favor upward movements as they allow broader access to apple rows above, while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that my immediate options don\u2019t seem to lead to immediate apple collection and also considering not backtracking is crucial\u2014moving **UP to (4, 7)** is the most strategic choice for now.\n\nNext move: UP."

However, moving to (2, 6) presents certain risks if the enemy snake moves in my direction as well.\n\n### Possible Moves from (4, 6):\n1. **UP to (4, 7)**: Valid move, but does not progress towards any apples.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 5)**: This would bring me back to my previous position, which is not advisable.\n3. **LEFT to (3, 6)**: This would also bring me back to my previous position, which is not advisable.\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 6)**: Valid move, but will not advance towards any apples.\n\n### Evaluating Benefits:\n- **UP to (4, 7)** does not yield any immediate gains but positions me slightly higher on the board, potentially opening up new moves on the next turn.\n- Both **LEFT** and **DOWN** are not options as they map back to my previous location.\n- **RIGHT to (5, 6)** holds no immediate advantage since no apple can be collected.\n\n### Long-term Strategy:\n- I need to think a couple of moves ahead. If I consider an eventual goal of reaching apples, the move UP to (4, 7) ensures I stay safe for another turn while still keeping other options available.\n- The strategy should favor upward movements as they allow broader access to apple rows above, while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that my immediate options don\u2019t seem to lead to immediate apple collection and also considering not backtracking is crucial\u2014moving **UP to (4, 7)** is the most strategic choice for now.\n\nNext move: UP."

Since the snake is moving forward and the tail is expected to vacate this cell in the next move, moving UP should be safe. However, I need to ensure that the enemy snake doesn't block this path in subsequent turns.\n   - **Benefit:** Moving UP does not bring me closer to any immediate apples. It maintains my position centrally, offering flexibility but lacking in immediate rewards.\n\n2. **RIGHT** to **(3, 5)**:\n   - **Safety:** The cell **(3, 5)** is unoccupied and within the board boundaries. There are no immediate threats in this direction.\n   - **Benefit:** Moving RIGHT positions me closer to the apple at **(3, 1)**.

There are no immediate threats or obstacles in this direction.\n   - **Benefit:** Moving UP keeps my options flexible for future moves. However, it doesn't directly bring me closer to any immediate apple. This move could be beneficial if I aim to navigate around the upper section of the board, potentially avoiding congested areas.\n\n2. **RIGHT** to **(4, 4)**:\n   - **Safety:** The cell **(4, 4)** is unoccupied and within the board boundaries. There are no enemy snakes or obstacles adjacent to this cell.\n   - **Benefit:** Moving RIGHT positions me closer to the apple at **(4, 3)**. This alignment facilitates a straightforward path to collect the apple in the next move. Additionally, advancing towards the right side of the board opens up opportunities to access other apples located on the right, such as **(6, 2)** and **(9, 1)**, enhancing potential scoring avenues.\n\n3. **DOWN** to **(3, 3)**:\n   - **Safety:** The cell **(3, 3)** is unoccupied and within the board boundaries. Moving DOWN does not place me adjacent to any enemy snakes or their bodies.\n   - **Benefit:** Moving DOWN brings me directly closer to the apple at **(4, 3)**. From this position, I can move RIGHT in the subsequent turn to collect the apple efficiently. This path minimizes the number of moves required to gain an additional point and keeps me centrally positioned for accessing other nearby apples, such as those at **(2, 1)** and **(3, 1)**.\n\n4. **LEFT** to **(2, 4)**:\n   - **Safety:** The cell **(2, 4)** is part of my tail, indicated by a **T**. As my tail moves forward, this move is deemed safe.\n   - **Benefit:** Moving LEFT takes me away from the cluster of apples, reducing immediate scoring opportunities. Additionally, it limits flexibility for future moves, as I would be positioned further from the central and right sections of the board where more apples are located.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nConsidering all safe moves (**UP**, **RIGHT**, and **DOWN**), **DOWN** offers a strategic advantage by bringing me directly closer to the apple at **(4, 3)**. This move allows me to collect the apple in the next turn with minimal maneuvering, thereby maximizing score gain efficiently. While moving **RIGHT** also positions me near the apple, moving **DOWN** ensures a quicker path to consumption and maintains central positioning for accessing other nearby apples.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nAfter moving **DOWN** to **(3, 3)**, my immediate goal is to move **RIGHT** to **(4, 3)** to consume the apple and gain a point. Post-consumption, I should assess the board to determine the next closest apple, possibly targeting the one at **(6, 2)** or repositioning towards the lower section of the board to collect multiple apples efficiently. Maintaining awareness of the enemy snake's movements is crucial to avoid potential blockages or confrontations.

However, it doesn't provide a direct path to consume an apple in the near term.\n\n- **RIGHT** to **(1, 8)**:\n  - **Safety:** The cell **(1, 8)** is empty and within the board boundaries. There's no immediate danger from enemy snakes in this direction.\n  - **Benefit:** Moving RIGHT positions me closer to the apple at **(1, 7)**. From **(1, 8)**, I can easily move DOWN to consume the apple, securing a point and potentially creating more opportunities for growth.\n\n- **DOWN** to **(0, 7)**:\n  - **Safety:** The cell **(0, 7)** was my previous position. Assuming standard snake mechanics where the tail moves forward, this move would be safe as the cell would be vacated.\n  - **Benefit:** While moving DOWN doesn't result in immediate apple consumption, it positions me nearer to the apple at **(1, 7)**. This strategic positioning allows for a straightforward subsequent move to the RIGHT to consume the apple.\n\n- **LEFT** to **(-1, 8)**:\n  - **Safety:** Invalid move; it would take me out of the board boundaries.\n  - **Benefit:** Results in death due to collision with the wall.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nMoving **RIGHT** to **(1, 8)** is the most advantageous and safe option. It strategically positions me adjacent to the apple at **(1, 7)**, allowing for its consumption in the following move. This approach not only secures an immediate point but also enhances my snake's length, providing greater maneuverability and reducing the risk of collisions in future turns.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"

There are no immediate threats or obstacles in this direction.\n   - **Benefit:** Moving UP keeps my options flexible for future moves. However, it doesn't directly bring me closer to any immediate apple. This move could be beneficial if I aim to navigate around the upper section of the board, potentially avoiding congested areas.\n\n2. **RIGHT** to **(4, 4)**:\n   - **Safety:** The cell **(4, 4)** is unoccupied and within the board boundaries. There are no enemy snakes or obstacles adjacent to this cell.\n   - **Benefit:** Moving RIGHT positions me closer to the apple at **(4, 3)**. This alignment facilitates a straightforward path to collect the apple in the next move. Additionally, advancing towards the right side of the board opens up opportunities to access other apples located on the right, such as **(6, 2)** and **(9, 1)**, enhancing potential scoring avenues.\n\n3. **DOWN** to **(3, 3)**:\n   - **Safety:** The cell **(3, 3)** is unoccupied and within the board boundaries. Moving DOWN does not place me adjacent to any enemy snakes or their bodies.\n   - **Benefit:** Moving DOWN brings me directly closer to the apple at **(4, 3)**. From this position, I can move RIGHT in the subsequent turn to collect the apple efficiently. This path minimizes the number of moves required to gain an additional point and keeps me centrally positioned for accessing other nearby apples, such as those at **(2, 1)** and **(3, 1)**.\n\n4. **LEFT** to **(2, 4)**:\n   - **Safety:** The cell **(2, 4)** is part of my tail, indicated by a **T**. As my tail moves forward, this move is deemed safe.\n   - **Benefit:** Moving LEFT takes me away from the cluster of apples, reducing immediate scoring opportunities. Additionally, it limits flexibility for future moves, as I would be positioned further from the central and right sections of the board where more apples are located.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nConsidering all safe moves (**UP**, **RIGHT**, and **DOWN**), **DOWN** offers a strategic advantage by bringing me directly closer to the apple at **(4, 3)**. This move allows me to collect the apple in the next turn with minimal maneuvering, thereby maximizing score gain efficiently. While moving **RIGHT** also positions me near the apple, moving **DOWN** ensures a quicker path to consumption and maintains central positioning for accessing other nearby apples.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\nAfter moving **DOWN** to **(3, 3)**, my immediate goal is to move **RIGHT** to **(4, 3)** to consume the apple and gain a point. Post-consumption, I should assess the board to determine the next closest apple, possibly targeting the one at **(6, 2)** or repositioning towards the lower section of the board to collect multiple apples efficiently. Maintaining awareness of the enemy snake's movements is crucial to avoid potential blockages or confrontations.

UP to (2, 2):**\n\n- **Safety:**  \n  The cell **(2, 2)** is unoccupied and within the board boundaries. There are no immediate threats from enemy snakes in this direction.\n\n- **Opportunity:**  \n  Moving up positions me closer to the apple at **(2, 6)**. While this apple is farther away compared to those on the left, securing it can yield higher points. This path also offers flexibility to navigate towards other apples like **(0, 8)** and **(5, 8)** in future moves.\n\n### **3. DOWN to (2, 0):**\n\n- **Safety:**  \n  The cell **(2, 0)** is unoccupied and within the board boundaries. However, moving down does not present any immediate threats.\n\n- **Opportunity:**  \n  Moving down takes me closer to the lower boundary of the board, moving away from the cluster of apples. This direction does not align with my current apple-centric strategy and offers minimal strategic advantage.\n\n---\n\n### **Decision:**\n\n- **LEFT** is the most strategic and safe move. It advances my position towards the apple at **(1, 3)**, allowing me to collect it within the next few moves. This aligns well with my strategy of targeting nearby apples to maximize point gains efficiently.\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n- **Proceed Towards (1, 3):** After moving left, prioritize moving up twice to consume the apple at **(1, 3)**. This will set me up to target the apple at **(0, 4)** subsequently.\n\n- **Maintain Flexibility:** Ensure that each move keeps multiple pathways open to prevent getting trapped as more apples are collected and the snake grows in length.\n\n- **Monitor Enemy Positions:** Continue to observe the enemy snake's movements to avoid potential collisions, especially as both snakes navigate towards areas with multiple apples.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

However, moving to (2, 6) presents certain risks if the enemy snake moves in my direction as well.\n\n### Possible Moves from (4, 6):\n1. **UP to (4, 7)**: Valid move, but does not progress towards any apples.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 5)**: This would bring me back to my previous position, which is not advisable.\n3. **LEFT to (3, 6)**: This would also bring me back to my previous position, which is not advisable.\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 6)**: Valid move, but will not advance towards any apples.\n\n### Evaluating Benefits:\n- **UP to (4, 7)** does not yield any immediate gains but positions me slightly higher on the board, potentially opening up new moves on the next turn.\n- Both **LEFT** and **DOWN** are not options as they map back to my previous location.\n- **RIGHT to (5, 6)** holds no immediate advantage since no apple can be collected.\n\n### Long-term Strategy:\n- I need to think a couple of moves ahead. If I consider an eventual goal of reaching apples, the move UP to (4, 7) ensures I stay safe for another turn while still keeping other options available.\n- The strategy should favor upward movements as they allow broader access to apple rows above, while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven that my immediate options don\u2019t seem to lead to immediate apple collection and also considering not backtracking is crucial\u2014moving **UP to (4, 7)** is the most strategic choice for now.\n\nNext move: UP."

UP to (2, 2):**\n\n- **Safety:**  \n  The cell **(2, 2)** is unoccupied and within the board boundaries. There are no immediate threats from enemy snakes in this direction.\n\n- **Opportunity:**  \n  Moving up positions me closer to the apple at **(2, 6)**. While this apple is farther away compared to those on the left, securing it can yield higher points. This path also offers flexibility to navigate towards other apples like **(0, 8)** and **(5, 8)** in future moves.\n\n### **3. DOWN to (2, 0):**\n\n- **Safety:**  \n  The cell **(2, 0)** is unoccupied and within the board boundaries. However, moving down does not present any immediate threats.\n\n- **Opportunity:**  \n  Moving down takes me closer to the lower boundary of the board, moving away from the cluster of apples. This direction does not align with my current apple-centric strategy and offers minimal strategic advantage.\n\n---\n\n### **Decision:**\n\n- **LEFT** is the most strategic and safe move. It advances my position towards the apple at **(1, 3)**, allowing me to collect it within the next few moves. This aligns well with my strategy of targeting nearby apples to maximize point gains efficiently.\n\n### **Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n- **Proceed Towards (1, 3):** After moving left, prioritize moving up twice to consume the apple at **(1, 3)**. This will set me up to target the apple at **(0, 4)** subsequently.\n\n- **Maintain Flexibility:** Ensure that each move keeps multiple pathways open to prevent getting trapped as more apples are collected and the snake grows in length.\n\n- **Monitor Enemy Positions:** Continue to observe the enemy snake's movements to avoid potential collisions, especially as both snakes navigate towards areas with multiple apples.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"
