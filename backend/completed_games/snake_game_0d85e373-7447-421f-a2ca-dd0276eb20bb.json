I don't want to run into Snake #2, so I'll try to avoid it for now.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to move up towards the top of the board, trying to get as close to the apple at (3, 4) as possible while also keeping an eye out for Snake #2.\n\nNext move: UP."

I'll try to get as close to it as possible without running into any obstacles.\n\nI'll also keep an eye on the enemy snake #1, which is at (6, 9). I don't see its body, so I'm not sure how long it is, but I'll try to avoid it for now.\n\nI'll also try to remember that there's an apple at (5, 3) which is relatively close to my current position.\n\nNow, let's think about the possible moves. If I move LEFT, I'll be at (3, 5), which is close to the apple at (3, 4). If I move RIGHT, I'll be at (5, 5), which is close to the apple at (5, 3). If I move UP, I'll be at (4, 6), which is not close to any apples. If I move DOWN, I'll be at (4, 4), which is close to the apple at (3, 4).\n\nConsidering all these options, I think the best move is to move LEFT, as it gets me closer to the nearest apple.\n\nMy decided next move: LEFT."
