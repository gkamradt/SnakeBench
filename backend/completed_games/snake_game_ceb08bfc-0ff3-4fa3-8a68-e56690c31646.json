UP: Moving up would take me to (7, 6), which is a safe move but wouldn't bring me closer to any of the apples.\n\n2. DOWN: Moving down would take me to (7, 4), which is a safe move but would take me farther away from the nearest apple at (7, 2).\n\n3. LEFT: Moving left would take me to (6, 5), which is a safe move but would take me farther away from the apple at (7, 2).\n\n4. RIGHT: Moving right would take me to (8, 5), which is also a safe move and would bring me one step closer to the apple at (8, 0).\n\nStrategy:\nThe best move seems to be RIGHT. Moving RIGHT would bring me one step closer to the apple at (8, 0) while staying safe and avoiding the enemy snake. After this move, I should continue moving towards (8, 0) while staying vigilant and avoiding getting cornered or running into the enemy snake.\n\nMy next move: RIGHT\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving RIGHT, I should continue moving towards the apple at (8, 0) while staying safe and avoiding the enemy snake. I should also keep an eye on the other apples and plan my moves accordingly, especially the apple at (4, 8) which might become more accessible soon."
