The enemy snake still hasn't made any significant moves towards the apples I'm targeting, so I can continue with my current strategy.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (1, 3) is now just two moves away. Moving LEFT again would allow me to reach this apple in the next turn. After reaching the apple, I can reassess the situation and decide whether to target the apples at (6, 2) or (7, 3) next, depending on the enemy snake's movements.\n\nIt's important to note that the enemy snake is currently at (5, 4), which is relatively close to the center of the board. I should be cautious and keep an eye on its movements to avoid any potential collisions.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After reaching the apple at (1, 3), evaluate the enemy snake's position and movements. If the enemy snake starts moving towards the apples at (6, 2) or (7, 3), prioritize the apple that is farther away from the enemy snake. Continue to maintain a safe distance from the enemy snake and the walls while targeting the remaining apples.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
