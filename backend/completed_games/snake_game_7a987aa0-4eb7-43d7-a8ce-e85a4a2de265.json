Since the map is empty of obstacles beyond apples and Snake #2 is distant, prioritize direct apple collection.\n\nCurrent Evaluation:\n- From my position (2, 5), the apples at (1, 5) and (5, 5) are horizontally aligned and reachable with minimal movement.\n\nDecision Analysis:\n- Moving LEFT to (1, 5) allows me to consume an apple immediately.\n- Post-move positioning will have me at the edge, but further movements can branch upwards or I can proceed back to the right safely by leveraging the open board.\n\nFuture Strategy Reminder:\n- Consider post-consumption paths that allow access to the upper apples (like the one at (4, 6)) to avoid being constrained to the bottom of the board or getting trapped in corners.\n\nFinal Decision:\n- Move LEFT to consume the apple at (1, 5).\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

Maintain a path that allows flexibility for future moves, avoiding corners or edges excessively early.\n3. Since the map is empty of obstacles beyond apples and Snake #2 is distant, prioritize direct apple collection.\n\nCurrent Evaluation:\n- From my position (2, 5), the apples at (1, 5) and (5, 5) are horizontally aligned and reachable with minimal movement.\n\nDecision Analysis:\n- Moving LEFT to (1, 5) allows me to consume an apple immediately.\n- Post-move positioning will have me at the edge, but further movements can branch upwards or I can proceed back to the right safely by leveraging the open board.\n\nFuture Strategy Reminder:\n- Consider post-consumption paths that allow access to the upper apples (like the one at (4, 6)) to avoid being constrained to the bottom of the board or getting trapped in corners.\n\nFinal Decision:\n- Move LEFT to consume the apple at (1, 5).\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

Look for the closest apple to maximize the points quickly, while avoiding unnecessary turns or trap situations.\n2. Maintain a path that allows flexibility for future moves, avoiding corners or edges excessively early.\n3. Since the map is empty of obstacles beyond apples and Snake #2 is distant, prioritize direct apple collection.\n\nCurrent Evaluation:\n- From my position (2, 5), the apples at (1, 5) and (5, 5) are horizontally aligned and reachable with minimal movement.\n\nDecision Analysis:\n- Moving LEFT to (1, 5) allows me to consume an apple immediately.\n- Post-move positioning will have me at the edge, but further movements can branch upwards or I can proceed back to the right safely by leveraging the open board.\n\nFuture Strategy Reminder:\n- Consider post-consumption paths that allow access to the upper apples (like the one at (4, 6)) to avoid being constrained to the bottom of the board or getting trapped in corners.\n\nFinal Decision:\n- Move LEFT to consume the apple at (1, 5).\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"

Given that Snake #2's position at (5, 3) and its potential path up means that's a no-go zone for now.\n  \n2. **Canvas the Board:**\n   - Looking forward, there are two potential apples I can safely consider: moving towards either (8, 9) or (7, 1) down the road.\n  \n3. **Calculating Safe Paths:**\n   - Going RIGHT again to (7, 5) provides continued central positioning, potentially allowing me to move UP in the next turn toward the higher apples while keeping the current path clear from Snake #2.\n   \n4. **Strategic Location:**\n   - Maintain positions that allow for future flexible transitions. Getting boxed in will limit growth potential.\n\n5. **Watch for Snake #2 Movement:**\n   - Since Snake #2 might be moving towards the apple at (7, 1), prepare for possible competition in that direction. Remaining adaptable and seizing opportunities while keeping my path open is crucial.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n- After moving RIGHT, I will continue monitoring changes in apple locations and the movements of Snake #2. By retaining my central positioning, I ensure strategic advantage and adaptability, keeping options open for shifting direction to align with apple acquisition goals. \n\n**Decided Next Move: RIGHT**"

The apple at (1, 4) is too far given the current game state, and the apple at (7, 1) could attract both my movement and Snake #2's, depending on how the game unfolds.\n- As of now, my snake remains on open ground, having space to maneuver around Snake #2.\n\n**Considerations for Next Move:**\n\n1. **Avoiding Collision:** \n   - Snake #2's head is directly in my vicinity, and any sudden movement clashes could disable me. Given that Snake #2's position at (5, 3) and its potential path up means that's a no-go zone for now.\n  \n2. **Canvas the Board:**\n   - Looking forward, there are two potential apples I can safely consider: moving towards either (8, 9) or (7, 1) down the road.\n  \n3. **Calculating Safe Paths:**\n   - Going RIGHT again to (7, 5) provides continued central positioning, potentially allowing me to move UP in the next turn toward the higher apples while keeping the current path clear from Snake #2.\n   \n4. **Strategic Location:**\n   - Maintain positions that allow for future flexible transitions. Getting boxed in will limit growth potential.\n\n5. **Watch for Snake #2 Movement:**\n   - Since Snake #2 might be moving towards the apple at (7, 1), prepare for possible competition in that direction. Remaining adaptable and seizing opportunities while keeping my path open is crucial.\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n- After moving RIGHT, I will continue monitoring changes in apple locations and the movements of Snake #2.

Considering proximity, the apples at (8, 9) and (8, 7) are more feasible for me without steering too close to Snake #2's likely path.\n\n2. **Collision Avoidance:**\n   - Snake #2 is presently at (4, 3) and seems to have a path heading upwards. Avoiding lateral movements toward Snake #2's potential directions should remain a priority.\n\n3. **Board Positioning and Flexibility:**\n   - Being near the middle of the board at (7, 5) allows versatile shifts either upwards towards easier apples or diagonally lateral for a better position oriented towards other board resources.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (8, 5) positions me one step closer to the apple at (8, 7), which is an optimal strategic direction because:\n  - It allows advancing towards the apple at (8, 7).\n  - It remains a safe trajectory given Snake #2 is at a distance to my southwest.\n  - It ensures I have further movement options open in the next few turns like upward or further right toward the longer horizontal apples.\n  \n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n- From (8, 5), I can choose to go either UP toward (8, 7) or, if strategically prudent, continue toward the top right for subsequent apple gathering.\n- This position allows me maximum decision-making ability based on Snake #2's next moves.

From (6, 5), I can reassess moving upwards toward the apples at (3, 9) or (8, 9) depending on enemy movements.\n4. It's also worth considering the trajectory of enemy Snake #2, which might move to the apple at (7, 1).\n\n**Future Scenarios:**\n\n- After moving **RIGHT**, I should keep an eye on the apple availability and the position of Snake #2. I can then decide whether to attempt to loop back down to catch the apple at (5, 3) if Snake #2 moves, or move up to position to go for (3, 9) or (8, 9).\n- Maintaining my options for pathing and ensuring I have escape routes from potential snake traps will be key.\n\n**Next Move Decision: RIGHT**\n\n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n- Post-move to (6, 5), evaluate the actions and movements of Snake #2.\n- Be ready to shift focus to alternative apples if Snake #2 begins moving toward (5, 3) or maneuvers in a way that makes reaching it difficult.\n- Stay agile and look for open areas, avoiding being trapped between the wall and other snakes. Monitor both enemy positions and their potential paths to maintain board control. \n\n**Next Move Decision: RIGHT**"

The board is quite open, but wherever I move is important for dodging Snake #2 and optimizing apple collection.\n- I've previously moved RIGHT, and my immediate options are to continue RIGHT to position (8, 5), move UP to (7, 6), DOWN to (7, 4), or LEFT to (6, 5). \n\n**Objectives:**\n\n1. **Apple Acquisition:**\n   - Apples available are located at (3, 9), (8, 9), (1, 4), (7, 1), and (8, 7). Considering proximity, the apples at (8, 9) and (8, 7) are more feasible for me without steering too close to Snake #2's likely path.\n\n2. **Collision Avoidance:**\n   - Snake #2 is presently at (4, 3) and seems to have a path heading upwards. Avoiding lateral movements toward Snake #2's potential directions should remain a priority.\n\n3. **Board Positioning and Flexibility:**\n   - Being near the middle of the board at (7, 5) allows versatile shifts either upwards towards easier apples or diagonally lateral for a better position oriented towards other board resources.\n\n**Strategic Analysis:**\n\n- Moving RIGHT to (8, 5) positions me one step closer to the apple at (8, 7), which is an optimal strategic direction because:\n  - It allows advancing towards the apple at (8, 7).\n  - It remains a safe trajectory given Snake #2 is at a distance to my southwest.\n  - It ensures I have further movement options open in the next few turns like upward or further right toward the longer horizontal apples.\n  \n**Strategy for Next Turn:**\n\n- From (8, 5), I can choose to go either UP toward (8, 7) or, if strategically prudent, continue toward the top right for subsequent apple gathering.\n- This position allows me maximum decision-making ability based on Snake #2's next moves. Monitoring its movements will be essential, ready for the possibility of needing a strategic shift in direction.\n\n**Decided Next Move: RIGHT**"
