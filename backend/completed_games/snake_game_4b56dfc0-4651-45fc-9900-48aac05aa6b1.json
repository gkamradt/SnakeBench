The body of enemy snake #2 is located at (7, 4).\n\nSince my snake occupies the position (4, 4) after moving right from (3, 4) (as stated in the previous move), I should clarify my available options:\n1. **UP to (4, 5)**: This square is open.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 3)**: This square is also open.\n3. **LEFT to (3, 4)**: This would lead me backward to my previous position, which is not optimal.\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 4)**: This is another open square.\n\n### Apple Target Analysis\n1. The apple at (8, 4) is directly available by moving right and then right again in the next turn.\n2. The apple at (6, 7) is open, but moving there wouldn't immediately prepare me for the next apples until I double back south.\n\n### Enemy Encounter\nEnemy snake #2 at (7, 4) poses a slight threat if I attempt to move into that vicinity, especially since its body is currently empty, and it could theoretically move toward me in the next turn. If I venture towards (4, 5) or (5, 4), I may create a two-snake standoff at (4, 5) or ideally push towards (5, 4) where I can then decide to go up or back to (4, 4).\n\n### Risk Assessment\n- Moving UP to (4, 5) allows my snake to position itself freely while monitoring the movements of enemy snake #2.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 4) would cut me off from other apple targets, but keeps me aligned with the apple on (8, 4) for future directions.\n\n### Strategic Conclusion\nGiven the current state, my next move should strategically position me without risking collision. I can move to (4, 5) or (5, 4). However, I prefer the UP move to (4, 5) because it keeps my movement options open.\n\nHence, my next move will be **UP**."

The apples are located at (6, 7), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), and (2, 0), and my current head position is (4, 4). The body of enemy snake #2 is located at (7, 4).\n\nSince my snake occupies the position (4, 4) after moving right from (3, 4) (as stated in the previous move), I should clarify my available options:\n1. **UP to (4, 5)**: This square is open.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 3)**: This square is also open.\n3. **LEFT to (3, 4)**: This would lead me backward to my previous position, which is not optimal.\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 4)**: This is another open square.\n\n### Apple Target Analysis\n1. The apple at (8, 4) is directly available by moving right and then right again in the next turn.\n2. The apple at (6, 7) is open, but moving there wouldn't immediately prepare me for the next apples until I double back south.\n\n### Enemy Encounter\nEnemy snake #2 at (7, 4) poses a slight threat if I attempt to move into that vicinity, especially since its body is currently empty, and it could theoretically move toward me in the next turn. If I venture towards (4, 5) or (5, 4), I may create a two-snake standoff at (4, 5) or ideally push towards (5, 4) where I can then decide to go up or back to (4, 4).\n\n### Risk Assessment\n- Moving UP to (4, 5) allows my snake to position itself freely while monitoring the movements of enemy snake #2.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 4) would cut me off from other apple targets, but keeps me aligned with the apple on (8, 4) for future directions.\n\n### Strategic Conclusion\nGiven the current state, my next move should strategically position me without risking collision. I can move to (4, 5) or (5, 4). However, I prefer the UP move to (4, 5) because it keeps my movement options open.\n\nHence, my next move will be **UP**."

The apples are located at (6, 7), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), and (2, 0), and my current head position is (4, 4). The body of enemy snake #2 is located at (7, 4).\n\nSince my snake occupies the position (4, 4) after moving right from (3, 4) (as stated in the previous move), I should clarify my available options:\n1. **UP to (4, 5)**: This square is open.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 3)**: This square is also open.\n3. **LEFT to (3, 4)**: This would lead me backward to my previous position, which is not optimal.\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 4)**: This is another open square.\n\n### Apple Target Analysis\n1. The apple at (8, 4) is directly available by moving right and then right again in the next turn.\n2. The apple at (6, 7) is open, but moving there wouldn't immediately prepare me for the next apples until I double back south.\n\n### Enemy Encounter\nEnemy snake #2 at (7, 4) poses a slight threat if I attempt to move into that vicinity, especially since its body is currently empty, and it could theoretically move toward me in the next turn. If I venture towards (4, 5) or (5, 4), I may create a two-snake standoff at (4, 5) or ideally push towards (5, 4) where I can then decide to go up or back to (4, 4).\n\n### Risk Assessment\n- Moving UP to (4, 5) allows my snake to position itself freely while monitoring the movements of enemy snake #2.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 4) would cut me off from other apple targets, but keeps me aligned with the apple on (8, 4) for future directions.\n\n### Strategic Conclusion\nGiven the current state, my next move should strategically position me without risking collision. I can move to (4, 5) or (5, 4). However, I prefer the UP move to (4, 5) because it keeps my movement options open.\n\nHence, my next move will be **UP**."

The body of enemy snake #2 is located at (7, 4).\n\nSince my snake occupies the position (4, 4) after moving right from (3, 4) (as stated in the previous move), I should clarify my available options:\n1. **UP to (4, 5)**: This square is open.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 3)**: This square is also open.\n3. **LEFT to (3, 4)**: This would lead me backward to my previous position, which is not optimal.\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 4)**: This is another open square.\n\n### Apple Target Analysis\n1. The apple at (8, 4) is directly available by moving right and then right again in the next turn.\n2. The apple at (6, 7) is open, but moving there wouldn't immediately prepare me for the next apples until I double back south.\n\n### Enemy Encounter\nEnemy snake #2 at (7, 4) poses a slight threat if I attempt to move into that vicinity, especially since its body is currently empty, and it could theoretically move toward me in the next turn. If I venture towards (4, 5) or (5, 4), I may create a two-snake standoff at (4, 5) or ideally push towards (5, 4) where I can then decide to go up or back to (4, 4).\n\n### Risk Assessment\n- Moving UP to (4, 5) allows my snake to position itself freely while monitoring the movements of enemy snake #2.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 4) would cut me off from other apple targets, but keeps me aligned with the apple on (8, 4) for future directions.\n\n### Strategic Conclusion\nGiven the current state, my next move should strategically position me without risking collision. I can move to (4, 5) or (5, 4). However, I prefer the UP move to (4, 5) because it keeps my movement options open.\n\nHence, my next move will be **UP**."

The apples are located at (6, 7), (8, 4), (8, 3), (8, 2), and (2, 0), and my current head position is (4, 4). The body of enemy snake #2 is located at (7, 4).\n\nSince my snake occupies the position (4, 4) after moving right from (3, 4) (as stated in the previous move), I should clarify my available options:\n1. **UP to (4, 5)**: This square is open.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 3)**: This square is also open.\n3. **LEFT to (3, 4)**: This would lead me backward to my previous position, which is not optimal.\n4. **RIGHT to (5, 4)**: This is another open square.\n\n### Apple Target Analysis\n1. The apple at (8, 4) is directly available by moving right and then right again in the next turn.\n2. The apple at (6, 7) is open, but moving there wouldn't immediately prepare me for the next apples until I double back south.\n\n### Enemy Encounter\nEnemy snake #2 at (7, 4) poses a slight threat if I attempt to move into that vicinity, especially since its body is currently empty, and it could theoretically move toward me in the next turn. If I venture towards (4, 5) or (5, 4), I may create a two-snake standoff at (4, 5) or ideally push towards (5, 4) where I can then decide to go up or back to (4, 4).\n\n### Risk Assessment\n- Moving UP to (4, 5) allows my snake to position itself freely while monitoring the movements of enemy snake #2.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 4) would cut me off from other apple targets, but keeps me aligned with the apple on (8, 4) for future directions.\n\n### Strategic Conclusion\nGiven the current state, my next move should strategically position me without risking collision. I can move to (4, 5) or (5, 4). However, I prefer the UP move to (4, 5) because it keeps my movement options open.\n\nHence, my next move will be **UP**."

If I venture towards (4, 5) or (5, 4), I may create a two-snake standoff at (4, 5) or ideally push towards (5, 4) where I can then decide to go up or back to (4, 4).\n\n### Risk Assessment\n- Moving UP to (4, 5) allows my snake to position itself freely while monitoring the movements of enemy snake #2.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 4) would cut me off from other apple targets, but keeps me aligned with the apple on (8, 4) for future directions.\n\n### Strategic Conclusion\nGiven the current state, my next move should strategically position me without risking collision. I can move to (4, 5) or (5, 4). However, I prefer the UP move to (4, 5) because it keeps my movement options open.\n\nHence, my next move will be **UP**."

This enemy is positioned at (7, 8) and is not currently a direct threat to my position at (5, 7) but moving UP could put me on a diagonal trajectory towards their position for the next turn.\n\n### Move Evaluation\n1. **UP (to (5, 8))**: This will allow me to grab the apple at (6, 7) in the next turn, and I will grow by one point.\n2. **DOWN (to (5, 6))**: This brings me further from the apple and doesn\u2019t pose any further immediate benefits.\n3. **LEFT (to (4, 7))**: This navigates me away from both the apple at (6, 7) and the position of the enemy snake.\n4. **RIGHT (to (6, 7))**: This move lands me directly on the apple; however, it places me in a vulnerable position to the enemy snake's potential movement.\n\n### Enemy Consideration\nMoving UP to (5, 8) next brings me directly in line for the apple at (6, 7), maximizing my score on the next turn. While the enemy snake (7, 8) is close, they can\u2019t reach me this turn if I choose to go UP.\n\n### Strategic Conclusion\nIncorporating the above considerations, my best move is to go **UP**, positioning myself for the apple at (6, 7) next turn while securing growth and scoring.\n\n### Next Move\n**UP**"
