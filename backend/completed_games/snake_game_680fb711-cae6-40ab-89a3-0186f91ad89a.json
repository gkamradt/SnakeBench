Not only is it a safe move, but it gets me to a position closer to an apple at (2, 7). \n\n2. **DOWN to (7, 6)**: This is backtracking, which is not allowed.\n\n3. **LEFT to (6, 7)**: This cell is also empty, giving me a safe option, but it doesn't get me any closer to the apples.\n\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 7)**: This cell is empty too, but it puts me further from the apples situated lower on the board.\n\nAnalyzing the options, moving UP to (7, 8) not only keeps me on the same column as a potential apple at (2, 7) but also opens up more future options to reach apples directly in the next moves. It keeps me safe from enemy snake proximity, as it doesn't bring me closer to their position at (7, 2).\n\nGiven all of this, the best and most strategic move is to go UP to (7, 8).\n\n**Decided Next Move**: UP"
