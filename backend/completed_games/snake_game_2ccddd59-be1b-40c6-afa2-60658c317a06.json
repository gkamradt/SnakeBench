I should plan a path that allows me to collect multiple apples efficiently without putting myself in a position where I might get trapped or boxed in.\n\nLooking at the board, I notice that there are apples at (3, 6), (3, 3), (4, 1), (2, 9), and (8, 5). My snake is currently at (2, 1), and there is an apple nearby at (2, 9), which is directly above my current position. However, moving directly up to (2, 9) would not be the best strategy because it would leave me in a position where I have to turn around and move back down, which could potentially lead to a collision with myself if I'm not careful.\n\nInstead, I should consider collecting the apples in a sequence that allows me to move towards other apples without unnecessary turns. The apple at (3, 6) is a good target because after collecting it, I can move down to (3, 3) and then decide whether to go right to (4, 1) or left to (2, 9). This sequence would allow me to grow longer and create a safer path for future moves.\n\nTo start this sequence, I should move towards the apple at (3, 6). The shortest path to this apple is to move right to (3, 1) and then up six times to (3, 6). This will also keep me away from the enemy snake at (5, 6).\n\nTherefore, my next move is: RIGHT.\n\nFor the next turn, I should remind myself to continue moving upwards after reaching (3, 1) to collect the apple at (3, 6). \n\nNext turn strategy: After reaching (3, 1), move UP six times to collect the apple at (3, 6)."
