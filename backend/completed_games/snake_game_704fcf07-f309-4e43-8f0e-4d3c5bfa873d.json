It is a safe incremental step towards the target apple.\n- It is crucial to remain vigilant about Snake #2, whose movement may also be towards the same apple. Must reconsider directions tactically as the board state updates.\n\n**Future Instructions to Self:**\n- Reevaluate positions right after the next move UP in order to decide the subsequent move, likely RIGHT, to secure the apple at (9, 5).\n- Stay flexible and adaptive to swiftly changing scenarios, especially considering the movement of Snake #2.\n- Aim to secure a path to the cluster of apples at (5, 8), (6, 8), and (7, 8) post the immediate apple acquisition at (9, 5) for maximum scoring.\n\n**Next Move:** UP"
