Let's calculate the distances to each apple:\n\n1. Distance to (8, 6): |8 - 4| + |6 - 1| = 4 + 5 = 9\n2. Distance to (5, 0): |5 - 4| + |0 - 1| = 1 + 1 = 2\n3. Distance to (9, 0): |9 - 4| + |0 - 1| = 5 + 1 = 6\n4. Distance to (6, 4): |6 - 4| + |4 - 1| = 2 + 3 = 5\n5. Distance to (3, 9): |3 - 4| + |9 - 1| = 1 + 8 = 9\n\nThe closest apple is at (5, 0), with a distance of 2. Next closest is at (6, 4) with a distance of 5. Since (5, 0) is closest, my next move should be towards that apple.\n\nFrom my current position (4, 1), I can move RIGHT to get closer to (5, 0). This will place me at (5, 1), one step away from the apple at (5, 0). This move avoids any wall collision and keeps me safe from the enemy snake, which is far away.\n\nFor the strategy next turn, if the path to (5, 0) remains clear, I'll proceed to move DOWN to claim the apple. I'll also need to stay aware of the enemy's movements and adapt if needed.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

            "rationale": "Strategy: I will prioritize collecting apples while avoiding collisions with walls, enemy snakes, and my own body. I will also try to block enemy snakes from reaching apples if possible.\nNext move: RIGHT\n\nRationale: I am currently at the edge of the board, so moving right will keep me within the playable area. Additionally, there are no apples or enemy snakes in the immediate vicinity to the right, so this move is relatively safe."
