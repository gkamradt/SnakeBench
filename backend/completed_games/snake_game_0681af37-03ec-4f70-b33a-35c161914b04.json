The apples on the board are at the following locations:\n- (7, 3)\n- (1, 9)\n- (0, 5)\n- (8, 3)\n\nThe enemy snake (#2) is at position (7, 5) and poses a potential threat if I navigate too close.\n\n### Evaluating Possible Moves from (6, 8):\n1. **UP to (6, 9)**: Out of bounds, as the Y-coordinate would be 10 which is not valid. \n2. **DOWN to (6, 7)**: This square is occupied by my own body, which means moving here would result in a self-collision and death.\n3. **LEFT to (5, 8)**: This square is empty. It doesn't immediately lead toward any apples but does keep me within a safe distance from the enemy.\n4. **RIGHT to (7, 8)**: This square is also empty. Staying away from the enemy while exploring new squares could be beneficial.\n\n### Immediate Objective:\nSince moving UP is illegal and DOWN results in self-collision, my choices are limited to either LEFT (5, 8) or RIGHT (7, 8). Both are valid moves that don\u2019t result in danger from walls or my own body.\n\n### Considerations Going Forward:\n- Moving LEFT to (5, 8) starts to move the snake away from the existing body but provides a path to explore downward rows later.\n- Moving RIGHT to (7, 8) keeps me on the same row as the enemy snake, which could be risky if I don't have a clear strategy afterward.\n\nGiven that I want to maintain some distance from the enemy snake while also expanding my body, I will opt for the safer choice of moving LEFT.\n\nNext move: **LEFT**."
