My snake is currently at position (6, 6), and there are apples at positions (2, 1), (2, 9), (0, 9), (6, 1), and (0, 2). \n\nI'm aiming to collect apples to grow my snake and gain points. Let's consider the options:\n\n1. **Apple at (6, 1):** This apple is straight down from my current position and very close by. It's likely the easiest and fastest apple to reach. However, moving towards this apple also means getting closer to the bottom of the board, where Snake #2 could potentially be a threat if it moves north.\n\n2. **Apple at (2, 9) and (0, 9):** Both these apples are far to the west and upwards. They would require several horizontal and vertical moves, but they are not near any immediate threats. However, going there would leave other apples potentially for Snake #2, who might choose to move northward.\n\n3. **Apple at (2, 1) and (0, 2):** These are also quite far, down towards the bottom-left corner, and would involve significant movement towards the other snake. \n\nGiven the board state and potential risks, the apple at (6, 1) presents the least immediate danger and is directly below my current position. Collecting it would give me a quick point without threading through potential threats or getting too close to the enemy snake.\n\nFor the next turn, if accessing apples starts to require threading through more potential dangers or parts of the enemy snake, I might want to focus on blocking the enemy or protecting my lead by positioning myself strategically.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:** Keep maintaining a balance between collecting apples and ensuring safety from the enemy snake.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** DOWN"

However, moving left would potentially put me in danger of running into the wall.\n\nThe next closest apple is at (0, 2), which is directly below my current position. This seems like a safer move, as it allows me to gain points without risking an immediate collision.\n\nAdditionally, the apple at (0, 9) is also relatively close, and moving up could be a viable strategy to avoid the enemy snake at (6, 6).\n\nConsidering the current game state and the potential risks, I think my best move for this turn would be to go DOWN, towards the apple at (0, 2).\n\nMy strategy for the next turn would be to continue evaluating the board and the positions of the apples and the enemy snake, and make a decision that maximizes my chances of gaining points while minimizing the risk of collision.\n\nMy next move: DOWN."
