The closest apple to (7,7) appears to be the one at (0,7). I'll need to consider the best path to get there, avoiding my own body and the other snake.

This is a valid move.\n\nIf I go up to (4, 3), I can aim for the apple at (9,9) in the future. Also keeps me away from my own body.\nIf I go down to (4, 1), I can aim for the apple at (1,0) and possibly cut off snake #2's movement.\nIf I go right to (5, 2), I can aim for the apple at (6, 2) or (9, 2) or (9, 9).\n\nThe apple at (6,2) seems like the closest and easiest goal. Also, moving right prevents me from going back on myself.
