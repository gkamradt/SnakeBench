            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (2,4). There are apples at (5,0), (0,3), (3,6), (7,4), and (4,9). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (8,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . 1 .\n\nRow 4: . . 2 . . . . A . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (5,0): Column 5, Row 0\n\n- (0,3): Column 0, Row 3\n\n- (3,6): Column 3, Row 6\n\n- (7,4): Column 7, Row 4\n\n- (4,9): Column 4, Row 9\n\nMy position is (2,4): Column 2, Row 4\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (8,5): Column 8, Row 5\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nLet me think about the closest apple. I'm at (2,4), and the apples are at (5,0), (0,3), (3,6), (7,4), and (4,9).\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (5,0): |2-5| + |4-0| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,3): |2-0| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (3,6): |2-3| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- (7,4): |2-7| + |4-4| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n- (4,9): |2-4| + |4-9| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (0,3) and (3,6), both with a distance of 3.\n\nI need to decide which one to go for first. Let's look at their positions:\n\n- (0,3) is to the left and down.\n\n- (3,6) is to the right and up.\n\nI should also consider the position of the enemy snake at (8,5). It's somewhat far from my current position, so maybe not an immediate threat.\n\nBut I need to plan my path carefully to avoid any potential collisions.\n\nLet's consider going for (0,3) first.\n\nFrom (2,4), to get to (0,3), I need to move left twice and down once.\n\nSo, possible path: left, left, down.\n\nBut I need to make sure that these moves don't lead me into the enemy or myself.\n\nWait, I don't have any body parts listed yet because I just started, so no risk of hitting myself yet.\n\nBut I need to consider that as I eat apples, I grow longer, so I'll have to keep track of my body parts to avoid them.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the enemy snake's possible movements. If it's at (8,5), and it's snake 1, I don't know its length or its direction, but since its body is empty, maybe it's just the head.\n\nI should assume it could move towards me, but for now, it's relatively far, so I'll focus on getting to the closest apple.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (0,3).\n\nFrom (2,4), moving left to (1,4), then left to (0,4), then down to (0,3).\n\nBut wait, is (0,4) occupied by anything? Looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\nSimilarly, (0,3) is the apple.\n\nSo, that seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (3,6):\n\nFrom (2,4), up to (2,5), then right to (3,5), then up to (3,6).\n\nAgain, checking the board, (2,5) and (3,5) seem empty.\n\nSo, both paths seem possible.\n\nBut (0,3) is closer in terms of steps, same as (3,6).\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first.\n\nMaybe I should consider the overall strategy.\n\nIf I take (0,3), then I can proceed to take (3,6), then maybe (7,4), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, going for (3,6) first might put me in a better position to reach other apples.\n\nLet me try to plan a path that collects the most apples without crossing my own path.\n\nWait, actually, since I grow with each apple I eat, I need to make sure that the path I take doesn't enclose areas that would block access to other apples.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just go for the closest apple, (0,3), collect it, grow, and then plan the next move.\n\nAfter eating (0,3), I would be at (0,3), having eaten the apple.\n\nThen, I can look for the next closest apple.\n\nAt that point, (3,6) would be next closest.\n\nFrom (0,3), to (3,6), that's |0-3| + |3-6| = 3 + 3 = 6 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (7,4) is |0-7| + |3-4| = 7 + 1 = 8 steps.\n\nSo, (3,6) is closer.\n\nSo, after eating (0,3), I can move right three times and up three times to reach (3,6).\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nWait, but I need to consider that I have grown longer, so I have to avoid running into my own body.\n\nAfter eating (0,3), my tail would be at (2,4), assuming I moved left twice and down once.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, when you move, your tail moves forward, and the new head is added where you moved.\n\nBut in this game, it's turn-based, and when you eat an apple, you grow.\n\nSo, if I move left to (1,4), then left to (0,4), then down to (0,3), eating the apple, my tail would still be at (2,4), but now I have bodies at (1,4), (0,4), and (0,3).\n\nWait, no, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail stays, and you grow by the length of the apple.\n\nSo, in this case, after eating the apple at (0,3), my snake would be at (0,3), with body at (1,4) and (2,4), assuming I moved left twice and down once.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIn Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail doesn't move forward; instead, your snake grows in length.\n\nSo, after eating an apple, your snake gets longer by one segment.\n\nIn this game, I start at (2,4), and I move left to (1,4), then left to (0,4), then down to (0,3), eating the apple.\n\nSo, my snake is now at (0,3), with body at (0,4) and (1,4), and tail at (2,4).\n\nAssuming I didn't move further, my body is the cells I have passed through.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, your body is all the cells from head to tail, and when you eat an apple, your tail stays, and you don't lose the last segment.\n\nSo, in this case, after eating the apple, my snake would be at (0,3), with body at (0,4), (1,4), and (2,4).\n\nWait, but in standard Snake, your body length increases by one segment for each apple eaten.\n\nSo, starting from (2,4), moving left to (1,4), left to (0,4), down to (0,3), eating the apple, now my snake is at (0,3), with body at (0,4) and (1,4), and the tail is still at (2,4), because I grew by one segment.\n\nWait, no, in Snake, when you eat"

There are apples at (5,0), (0,3), (3,6), (7,4), and (4,9). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (8,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . 1 .\n\nRow 4: . . 2 . . . .

Let's look at their positions:\n\n- (0,3) is to the left and down.\n\n- (3,6) is to the right and up.\n\nI should also consider the position of the enemy snake at (8,5). It's somewhat far from my current position, so maybe not an immediate threat.\n\nBut I need to plan my path carefully to avoid any potential collisions.\n\nLet's consider going for (0,3) first.\n\nFrom (2,4), to get to (0,3), I need to move left twice and down once.\n\nSo, possible path: left, left, down.\n\nBut I need to make sure that these moves don't lead me into the enemy or myself.\n\nWait, I don't have any body parts listed yet because I just started, so no risk of hitting myself yet.\n\nBut I need to consider that as I eat apples, I grow longer, so I'll have to keep track of my body parts to avoid them.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the enemy snake's possible movements. If it's at (8,5), and it's snake 1, I don't know its length or its direction, but since its body is empty, maybe it's just the head.\n\nI should assume it could move towards me, but for now, it's relatively far, so I'll focus on getting to the closest apple.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (0,3).\n\nFrom (2,4), moving left to (1,4), then left to (0,4), then down to (0,3).\n\nBut wait, is (0,4) occupied by anything? Looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\nSimilarly, (0,3) is the apple.\n\nSo, that seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (3,6):\n\nFrom (2,4), up to (2,5), then right to (3,5), then up to (3,6).\n\nAgain, checking the board, (2,5) and (3,5) seem empty.\n\nSo, both paths seem possible.\n\nBut (0,3) is closer in terms of steps, same as (3,6).\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first.\n\nMaybe I should consider the overall strategy.\n\nIf I take (0,3), then I can proceed to take (3,6), then maybe (7,4), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, going for (3,6) first might put me in a better position to reach other apples.\n\nLet me try to plan a path that collects the most apples without crossing my own path.\n\nWait, actually, since I grow with each apple I eat, I need to make sure that the path I take doesn't enclose areas that would block access to other apples.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just go for the closest apple, (0,3), collect it, grow, and then plan the next move.\n\nAfter eating (0,3), I would be at (0,3), having eaten the apple.\n\nThen, I can look for the next closest apple.\n\nAt that point, (3,6) would be next closest.\n\nFrom (0,3), to (3,6), that's |0-3| + |3-6| = 3 + 3 = 6 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (7,4) is |0-7| + |3-4| = 7 + 1 = 8 steps.\n\nSo, (3,6) is closer.\n\nSo, after eating (0,3), I can move right three times and up three times to reach (3,6).\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nWait, but I need to consider that I have grown longer, so I have to avoid running into my own body.\n\nAfter eating (0,3), my tail would be at (2,4), assuming I moved left twice and down once.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, when you move, your tail moves forward, and the new head is added where you moved.\n\nBut in this game, it's turn-based, and when you eat an apple, you grow.\n\nSo, if I move left to (1,4), then left to (0,4), then down to (0,3), eating the apple, my tail would still be at (2,4), but now I have bodies at (1,4), (0,4), and (0,3).\n\nWait, no, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail stays, and you grow by the length of the apple.\n\nSo, in this case, after eating the apple at (0,3), my snake would be at (0,3), with body at (1,4) and (2,4), assuming I moved left twice and down once.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIn Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail doesn't move forward; instead, your snake grows in length.\n\nSo, after eating an apple, your snake gets longer by one segment.\n\nIn this game, I start at (2,4), and I move left to (1,4), then left to (0,4), then down to (0,3), eating the apple.\n\nSo, my snake is now at (0,3), with body at (0,4) and (1,4), and tail at (2,4).\n\nAssuming I didn't move further, my body is the cells I have passed through.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, your body is all the cells from head to tail, and when you eat an apple, your tail stays, and you don't lose the last segment.\n\nSo, in this case, after eating the apple, my snake would be at (0,3), with body at (0,4), (1,4), and (2,4).\n\nWait, but in standard Snake, your body length increases by one segment for each apple eaten.\n\nSo, starting from (2,4), moving left to (1,4), left to (0,4), down to (0,3), eating the apple, now my snake is at (0,3), with body at (0,4) and (1,4), and the tail is still at (2,4), because I grew by one segment.\n\nWait, no, in Snake, when you eat"

After eating the apple at (0,3), my tail will be at (1,3), and I can't move back to (1,3) because it's now part of my body.\n\nSo, from (0,3), I can only move up to (0,4).\n\nThen, continue moving right and up to reach (3,6).\n\nI need to be careful not to get trapped or hit the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (8,3), it's on the same row as me, but far away.\n\nI need to consider its possible movements.\n\nIf it moves left towards me, I need to avoid it.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume it will stay put or move elsewhere.\n\nI should prioritize collecting apples efficiently while minimizing risk.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll move left to (0,3).\n\n**Final Move: LEFT**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this multi-apple Snake game, we need to strategically navigate our snake to collect apples while avoiding walls, the enemy snake, and ourselves. The board is a 10x10 grid with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify Positions:**\n   - Our snake is at (1,3).\n   - Apples are at (5,0), (0,3), (3,6), (7,4), and (4,9).\n   - The enemy snake is at (8,3).\n\n2. **Calculate Distances:**\n   - Use Manhattan distance to determine the closest apple.\n   - For the current position (1,3), the closest apple is at (0,3) with a distance of 1.\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Move left to (0,3) to eat the apple.\n   - After eating the apple, plan the next move to the next closest apple, which is at (3"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (2,4). There are apples at (5,0), (0,3), (3,6), (7,4), and (4,9). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (8,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . 1 .\n\nRow 4: . . 2 . . . . A . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (5,0): Column 5, Row 0\n\n- (0,3): Column 0, Row 3\n\n- (3,6): Column 3, Row 6\n\n- (7,4): Column 7, Row 4\n\n- (4,9): Column 4, Row 9\n\nMy position is (2,4): Column 2, Row 4\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (8,5): Column 8, Row 5\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nLet me think about the closest apple. I'm at (2,4), and the apples are at (5,0), (0,3), (3,6), (7,4), and (4,9).\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (5,0): |2-5| + |4-0| = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n- (0,3): |2-0| + |4-3| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (3,6): |2-3| + |4-6| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\n- (7,4): |2-7| + |4-4| = 5 + 0 = 5\n\n- (4,9): |2-4| + |4-9| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (0,3) and (3,6), both with a distance of 3.\n\nI need to decide which one to go for first. Let's look at their positions:\n\n- (0,3) is to the left and down.\n\n- (3,6) is to the right and up.\n\nI should also consider the position of the enemy snake at (8,5). It's somewhat far from my current position, so maybe not an immediate threat.\n\nBut I need to plan my path carefully to avoid any potential collisions.\n\nLet's consider going for (0,3) first.\n\nFrom (2,4), to get to (0,3), I need to move left twice and down once.\n\nSo, possible path: left, left, down.\n\nBut I need to make sure that these moves don't lead me into the enemy or myself.\n\nWait, I don't have any body parts listed yet because I just started, so no risk of hitting myself yet.\n\nBut I need to consider that as I eat apples, I grow longer, so I'll have to keep track of my body parts to avoid them.\n\nAlso, I need to think about the enemy snake's possible movements. If it's at (8,5), and it's snake 1, I don't know its length or its direction, but since its body is empty, maybe it's just the head.\n\nI should assume it could move towards me, but for now, it's relatively far, so I'll focus on getting to the closest apple.\n\nLet's consider moving towards (0,3).\n\nFrom (2,4), moving left to (1,4), then left to (0,4), then down to (0,3).\n\nBut wait, is (0,4) occupied by anything? Looking at the board, it seems empty.\n\nSimilarly, (0,3) is the apple.\n\nSo, that seems safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving towards (3,6):\n\nFrom (2,4), up to (2,5), then right to (3,5), then up to (3,6).\n\nAgain, checking the board, (2,5) and (3,5) seem empty.\n\nSo, both paths seem possible.\n\nBut (0,3) is closer in terms of steps, same as (3,6).\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first.\n\nMaybe I should consider the overall strategy.\n\nIf I take (0,3), then I can proceed to take (3,6), then maybe (7,4), and so on.\n\nAlternatively, going for (3,6) first might put me in a better position to reach other apples.\n\nLet me try to plan a path that collects the most apples without crossing my own path.\n\nWait, actually, since I grow with each apple I eat, I need to make sure that the path I take doesn't enclose areas that would block access to other apples.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just go for the closest apple, (0,3), collect it, grow, and then plan the next move.\n\nAfter eating (0,3), I would be at (0,3), having eaten the apple.\n\nThen, I can look for the next closest apple.\n\nAt that point, (3,6) would be next closest.\n\nFrom (0,3), to (3,6), that's |0-3| + |3-6| = 3 + 3 = 6 steps.\n\nAlternatively, (7,4) is |0-7| + |3-4| = 7 + 1 = 8 steps.\n\nSo, (3,6) is closer.\n\nSo, after eating (0,3), I can move right three times and up three times to reach (3,6).\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nWait, but I need to consider that I have grown longer, so I have to avoid running into my own body.\n\nAfter eating (0,3), my tail would be at (2,4), assuming I moved left twice and down once.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, when you move, your tail moves forward, and the new head is added where you moved.\n\nBut in this game, it's turn-based, and when you eat an apple, you grow.\n\nSo, if I move left to (1,4), then left to (0,4), then down to (0,3), eating the apple, my tail would still be at (2,4), but now I have bodies at (1,4), (0,4), and (0,3).\n\nWait, no, in Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail stays, and you grow by the length of the apple.\n\nSo, in this case, after eating the apple at (0,3), my snake would be at (0,3), with body at (1,4) and (2,4), assuming I moved left twice and down once.\n\nWait, I'm getting confused.\n\nLet me think again.\n\nIn Snake, when you eat an apple, your tail doesn't move forward; instead, your snake grows in length.\n\nSo, after eating an apple, your snake gets longer by one segment.\n\nIn this game, I start at (2,4), and I move left to (1,4), then left to (0,4), then down to (0,3), eating the apple.\n\nSo, my snake is now at (0,3), with body at (0,4) and (1,4), and tail at (2,4).\n\nAssuming I didn't move further, my body is the cells I have passed through.\n\nWait, actually, in Snake, your body is all the cells from head to tail, and when you eat an apple, your tail stays, and you don't lose the last segment.\n\nSo, in this case, after eating the apple, my snake would be at (0,3), with body at (0,4), (1,4), and (2,4).\n\nWait, but in standard Snake, your body length increases by one segment for each apple eaten.\n\nSo, starting from (2,4), moving left to (1,4), left to (0,4), down to (0,3), eating the apple, now my snake is at (0,3), with body at (0,4) and (1,4), and the tail is still at (2,4), because I grew by one segment.\n\nWait, no, in Snake, when you eat"

A . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 3: A 2 . . . . . . 1 .\n\nRow 2: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . A . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (5,0): Column 5, Row 0\n\n- (0,3): Column 0, Row 3\n\n- (3,6): Column 3, Row 6\n\n- (7,4): Column 7, Row 4\n\n- (4,9): Column 4, Row 9\n\nMy position is (1,3): Column 1, Row 3\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (8,3): Column 8, Row 3\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or myself.\n\nLet me think about the closest apple. I'm at (1,3), and the apples are at (5,0), (0,3), (3,6), (7,4), and (4,9).\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances to each apple:\n\n- (5,0): |1-5| + |3-0| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n- (0,3): |1-0| + |3-3| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n- (3,6): |1-3| + |3-6| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n- (7,4): |1-7| + |3-4| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n- (4,9): |1-4| + |3-9| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (0,3) with a distance of 1.\n\nLet's consider going for (0,3) first.\n\nFrom (1,3), I can move left to reach (0,3).\n\nPath: left.\n\nThis seems straightforward, and there don't seem to be any obstacles in the way.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (0,3), I'll be at (0,3), and my snake will have grown by one segment.\n\nNow, I need to plan the next move.\n\nWith the apple at (0,3) eaten, the remaining apples are at (5,0), (3,6), (7,4), and (4,9).\n\nFrom (0,3), let's calculate the distances to these apples:\n\n- (5,0): |0-5| + |3-0| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n- (3,6): |0-3| + |3-6| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- (7,4): |0-7| + |3-4| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n- (4,9): |0-4| + |3-9| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\nThe closest apple now is (3,6) with a distance of 6.\n\nLet's think about how to get from (0,3) to (3,6).\n\nI can move right three times and up three times.\n\nPath: right, right, right, up, up, up.\n\nBut I need to make sure that this path is safe.\n\nIn between, I might encounter the enemy snake, which is at (8,3), but that seems fairly far away.\n\nHowever, I should consider that the enemy snake might move towards me or towards an apple.\n\nTo minimize risk, I should try to reach the apple as quickly as possible without unnecessary exposure.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better sequence to collect the apples.\n\nLet me consider the positions again.\n\nIf I go to (0,3), then to (3,6), then perhaps to (7,4), and so on.\n\nBut that seems like a long path.\n\nMaybe I should consider a different order.\n\nLet's look at the positions again:\n\n- (5,0)\n\n- (3,6)\n\n- (7,4)\n\n- (4,9)\n\nFrom my current position at (1,3), the closest is (0,3), then (3,6).\n\nAfter eating (0,3), I'm at (0,3), and the next closest is (3,6).\n\nFrom (0,3) to (3,6), it's a distance of 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider going for (5,0) next.\n\nFrom (0,3), going to (5,0):\n\nDistance: |0-5| + |3-0| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\nThat's farther than (3,6).\n\nSo, (3,6) is still the better choice.\n\nAfter eating (3,6), I can look towards (7,4), which is |3-7| + |6-4| = 4 + 2 = 6.\n\nThen, from (7,4) to (4,9): |7-4| + |4-9| = 3 + 5 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, after (3,6), I could go to (4,9): |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nBut then from (4,9) to (7,4): |4-7| + |9-4| = 3 + 5 = 8.\n\nSo, perhaps (3,6) to (4,9) to (7,4).\n\nBut I need to consider the board layout and potential paths.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nMaybe I should just focus on the nearest apple for now and plan the next steps after eating it.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll go left to (0,3).\n\nNext turn, I'll need to decide whether to go up or right.\n\nFrom (0,3), moving up to (0,4), then right to (1,4), and so on to (3,6).\n\nBut I need to make sure that the path is clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving right to (1,3), but that's where I came from, and I can't go back because that would be hitting myself.\n\nWait, no. After eating the apple at (0,3), my tail will be at (1,3), and I can't move back to (1,3) because it's now part of my body.\n\nSo, from (0,3), I can only move up to (0,4).\n\nThen, continue moving right and up to reach (3,6).\n\nI need to be careful not to get trapped or hit the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the enemy snake at (8,3), it's on the same row as me, but far away.\n\nI need to consider its possible movements.\n\nIf it moves left towards me, I need to avoid it.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume it will stay put or move elsewhere.\n\nI should prioritize collecting apples efficiently while minimizing risk.\n\nSo, for this turn, I'll move left to (0,3).\n\n**Final Move: LEFT**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this multi-apple Snake game, we need to strategically navigate our snake to collect apples while avoiding walls, the enemy snake, and ourselves. The board is a 10x10 grid with coordinates ranging from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right.\n\n### Approach\n\n1. **Identify Positions:**\n   - Our snake is at (1,3).\n   - Apples are at (5,0), (0,3), (3,6), (7,4), and (4,9).\n   - The enemy snake is at (8,3).\n\n2. **Calculate Distances:**\n   - Use Manhattan distance to determine the closest apple.\n   - For the current position (1,3), the closest apple is at (0,3) with a distance of 1.\n\n3. **Plan the Path:**\n   - Move left to (0,3) to eat the apple.\n   - After eating the apple, plan the next move to the next closest apple, which is at (3"

I can move down to get to it, which would be a safe and efficient move.\n\nI'll try to get as many apples as possible, and then focus on avoiding the other snakes and the walls. I'll also keep an eye on the other snakes' positions and try to avoid them.\n\nNext move: DOWN"
          },
          "2": {
            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, I'm snake number 2, and I'm currently at position (1,3). The board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. There are apples at (5,0), (0,3), (3,6), (7,4), and (4,9). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (8,2), but it doesn't have any body parts yet, so it's just the head.\n\nI need to think about how to get to these apples without hitting walls, the enemy snake, or myself. Since this is a multi-apple game, I have to prioritize which apple to go for first.\n\nLet me look at the distances from my current position to each apple using Manhattan distance, which is suitable for grid movements.\n\n1. To (5,0): |1-5| + |3-0| = 4 + 3 = 7\n\n2. To (0,3): |1-0| + |3-3| = 1 + 0 = 1\n\n3. To (3,6): |1-3| + |3-6| = 2 + 3 = 5\n\n4. To (7,4): |1-7| + |3-4| = 6 + 1 = 7\n\n5. To (4,9): |1-4| + |3-9| = 3 + 6 = 9\n\nThe closest apple is at (0,3), which is only one step away to the left. That seems like a good choice to go for first.\n\nBut I should think about what happens after I eat that apple. After eating it, I'll grow longer, so my tail will extend. I need to make sure that my next moves don't lead me into a position where I can't move without hitting my own tail.\n\nLet's assume that after eating the apple at (0,3), my snake will have an additional segment. So, my tail will be at (1,3), and I'll be at (0,3).\n\nNow, from (0,3), I need to decide where to go next. Let's recalculate the distances to the remaining apples:\n\n1. To (5,0): |0-5| + |3-0| = 5 + 3 = 8\n\n2. To (3,6): |0-3| + |3-6| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n3. To (7,4): |0-7| + |3-4| = 7 + 1 = 8\n\n4. To (4,9): |0-4| + |3-9| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\nThe closest apple now is (3,6) at a distance of 6.\n\nSo, from (0,3), I need to get to (3,6). To do that, I can move right three times and up three times. But I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nLet me visualize the path:\n\nFrom (0,3), move right to (1,3), then (2,3), then (3,3), then up to (3,4), (3,5), and finally (3,6).\n\nI need to check if there are any obstacles in this path. The enemy snake is at (8,2), which is quite far away, so it shouldn't be an immediate threat.\n\nHowever, after I eat the apple at (3,6), I need to think about where to go next. Let's see the distances from (3,6) to the remaining apples:\n\n1. To (5,0): |3-5| + |6-0| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n2. To (7,4): |3-7| + |6-4| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n3. To (4,9): |3-4| + |6-9| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\nThe closest apple now is (4,9) at a distance of 4.\n\nFrom (3,6), I can move right once to (4,6), then up three times to (4,9).\n\nAgain, I need to ensure that path is clear. The enemy snake might have moved by now, but assuming it's not in my way, this should be fine.\n\nAfter eating (4,9), the remaining apples are at (5,0) and (7,4). From (4,9), the distances are:\n\n1. To (5,0): |4-5| + |9-0| = 1 + 9 = 10\n\n2. To (7,4): |4-7| + |9-4| = 3 + 5 = 8\n\nSo, the closest is (7,4) at a distance of 8.\n\nFrom (4,9), I can move right three times to (7,9), then down five times to (7,4).\n\nBut that seems a bit long. Maybe there's a shorter path. Alternatively, I could move down to (4,8), then right to (7,8), then down to (7,4). That's right three, down four, totaling 7 moves instead of 8. So, that's better.\n\nAgain, I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nAfter eating (7,4), only (5,0) remains. From (7,4), the distance to (5,0) is |7-5| + |4-0| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n\nSo, I can move left two times to (5,4), then down four times to (5,0).\n\nFinally, eat the last apple at (5,0).\n\nThis seems like a possible path, but I need to make sure that at each step, I don't run into the enemy snake or my own tail.\n\nGiven that the enemy snake is currently at (8,2), and assuming it doesn't move aggressively towards me, I should be okay.\n\nHowever, I should always be aware of the enemy's position and plan accordingly.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a more efficient order to eat the apples.\n\nLet me consider a different sequence:\n\n1. Eat (0,3)\n\n2. Then (3,6)\n\n3. Then (7,4)\n\n4. Then (5,0)\n\n5. Then (4,9)\n\nLet's see the distances for this path:\n\nFrom (1,3) to (0,3): 1\n\nFrom (0,3) to (3,6): 6\n\nFrom (3,6) to (7,4): 6\n\nFrom (7,4) to (5,0): 6\n\nFrom (5,0) to (4,9): 9\n\nTotal moves: 1 + 6 + 6 + 6 + 9 = 28 moves.\n\nAlternatively, another order:\n\n1. Eat (0,3)\n\n2. Then (3,6)\n\n3. Then (4,9)\n\n4. Then (7,4)\n\n5. Then (5,0)\n\nDistances:\n\n1 + 6 + 4 + 6 + 6 = 23 moves.\n\nThis seems more efficient.\n\nAlternatively:\n\n1. Eat (0,3)\n\n2. Then (3,6)\n\n3. Then (7,4)\n\n4. Then (4,9)\n\n5. Then (5,0)\n\nDistances:\n\n1 + 6 + 6 + 5 + 6 = 24 moves.\n\nSo, the second order is better with 23 moves.\n\nTherefore, I should consider eating (0,3), then (3,6), then (4,9), then (7,4), and finally (5,0).\n\nNow, for this turn, I'll move left to (0,3).\n\nNext turn, I'll need to move up to (0,4), then right to (1,4), and so on, towards (3,6).\n\nI need to be cautious of the enemy snake's movements in the meantime.\n\nBut for now, I'll proceed with moving left to eat the apple at (0,3).\n\n**Final Move: LEFT**\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\n## Final Solution\nTo solve this multi-apple Snake game, we need to strategically navigate our snake to collect apples while avoiding walls, the enemy snake, and ourselves.
