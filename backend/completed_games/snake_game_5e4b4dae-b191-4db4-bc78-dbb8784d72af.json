Both are equidistant, but the apple at (6, 7) to the right is less obstructed.\n   - The apples at (0, 5), (0, 4), and (1, 2) are farther away and potentially more hazardous due to enemy proximity.\n\n3. **Enemy Analysis**:\n   - Snake #2 is at (0, 6) and has no body, indicating it's a minimal threat right now.\n   - However, I should be cautious moving too close to its starting point at (0, 6), especially since apples nearby can attract it.\n\n4. **Potential Moves and Safety**:\n   - Moving **UP** to (4, 7) gets me closer to the apple at (6, 7).\n   - Moving **LEFT** or **RIGHT** has no clear advantage, especially considering the objective of reaching an apple soon.\n   - Moving **DOWN** leads further from any apple and is unnecessary.\n\n5. **Strategic Outlook**:\n   - Aim to collect the apple at (6, 7) next, then reassess the board for the next best apple.\n   - Maintain a safe distance from walls and the other snake, while keeping the board's dynamic in mind.\n\nBased on this analysis, I would go **UP** to move towards the apple at (6, 7) which seems to offer the best chance of growth without immediate risk.\n\n### Decided Next Move:\nUP"
