The logical move would be to go RIGHT and claim this point.\n\nIt seems that enemy snake #2 at (1, 9) has not moved towards the top right corner of the board, so it's still safe for me to pursue the apples here.\n\nIn the longer term, I should consider going after the apples at the bottom right corner. After consuming the apple at (8,9), if the enemy snake #2 is still far away, I should immediately go for the apple at (8,3) followed by the one at (8,4) with a sequence of moves going DOWN and then UP.\n\nHowever, if the enemy snake #2 starts encroaching towards the top right corner after I consume the apple at (8,9), I should consider going DOWN immediately after reaching (8,9) to avoid a collision and head towards (0,3), towards safer territory. My objective in this scenario would be to leave the top right corner free for the enemy snake to avoid a collision, and pick the apple at (0,3) for myself. The potential downside of this strategy is that snake #2 might grow faster if it consumes more apples.\n\nFor now, I am set for the next move, which is heading RIGHT.\n\nSo, my decided next move: RIGHT."
