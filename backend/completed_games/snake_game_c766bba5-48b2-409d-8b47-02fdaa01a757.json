The closest apple to me is at (6, 7), which is just one step to the right and one step up.\n\nMy strategy is to go for the closest apple first, which is at (6, 7). This will give me a quick point and also help me to grow my snake.\n\nNext, I'll think about which direction to move. To get to the apple at (6, 7), I need to move right and then up. But since I can only move one step at a time, I'll move right first.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Move up to get the apple.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
