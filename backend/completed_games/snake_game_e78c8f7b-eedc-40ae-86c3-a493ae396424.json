However, by moving UP to (5,7) we steer our head away from the enemy (who is directly below at (5,5)) and leave us options to later shift left toward (1,8) or (1,9). This extra vertical breathing room is valuable for avoiding potential head\u2013to\u2013head encounters or traps as the enemy snake moves.\n\nThus, my plan is to move UP now, then later maneuver left as needed to target an apple in the upper\u2013left area.\n\nDecided next move: UP."
