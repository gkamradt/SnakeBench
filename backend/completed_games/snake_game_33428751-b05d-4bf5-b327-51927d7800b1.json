This allows me to continue towards the apple at (4, 5) while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\nMy strategy for the next turn would be to continue moving UP towards the apple at (4, 5) if it is still available. I'll need to be mindful of the enemy snake's position and avoid getting too close.
