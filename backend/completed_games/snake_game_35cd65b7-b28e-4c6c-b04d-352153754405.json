This snake does not currently pose a direct threat to reaching the nearest apple, as it is located on a different trajectory.\n\n3. **Avoidance of Hazards**: \n   - Moving upwards or and rightwards initially keeps the path clear of any obstructions and lays groundwork for either continuing directly upwards towards the apple at (5, 6) later or shifting directions strategically.\n\n**Strategy Consideration**:\n   - Moving down is the quickest way to secure the nearest apple, increasing the score immediately without risk.\n   - Another strategic move could be setting a path towards the apple at (5, 6) after collecting the one at (0, 0).
