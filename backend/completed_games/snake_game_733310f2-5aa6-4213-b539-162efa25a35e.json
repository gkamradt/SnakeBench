This is beneficial as it involves moving towards the center, which generally offers more movement options.\n- Moving RIGHT to (9, 5) would approach the border of the board, reducing future maneuverability and not yielding an immediate apple.\n- Moving UP to (8, 6) does not immediately lead to an apple and could reduce vertical movement options in future turns.\n- Moving DOWN to (8, 4) moves directly away from any nearby apples.\n\nThinking about enemy movement:\n- The enemy snake located at (4, 7) is currently not an immediate threat if I focus on moving left towards the (7, 4) apple. Keeping a distance while collecting apples is strategically beneficial.\n\nStrategy for Next Turn:\n- After moving LEFT towards the (7, 4) apple, I suggest reassessing the board for the nearest apples and any changed positions of enemy snakes. There might be a strategic move towards the right (e.g., capturing the apple near the top at (5, 9)) depending on the locations of other apples and the enemy snake.\n\nDecided Next Move:\n- LEFT, aiming to get the apple located at (7, 4) on the subsequent move."

This move aligns perfectly with our strategy.\n\nNext turn Strategy:\n- Upon consuming the apple at (7, 4), the board will update the apples' locations, and we will need to reassess the closest new target. We should also keep an eye on the movement of any other snakes, especially snake #2, to gauge any potential threats or competition for nearby apples.
