However, moving directly to the apple might not be the best strategy if it puts the snake in a vulnerable position or if there are better opportunities elsewhere.\n\nLet's consider the options:\n- **UP**: Moving up would take the snake to (6, 4), which is closer to the apple at (7, 4) and also avoids any immediate danger from the enemy snake.\n- **DOWN**: Moving down would take the snake to (6, 2), which is not closer to any apple and might put the snake in a less strategic position.\n- **LEFT**: Moving left would take the snake to (5, 3), which is not closer to any apple and might put the snake in a less strategic position.\n- **RIGHT**: Moving right would take the snake to (7, 3), which is closer to the apple at (7, 4) but might be riskier if the enemy snake moves in a way that blocks the path.\n\nGiven these considerations, moving **UP** seems to be the best option as it brings the snake closer to the apple at (7, 4) and keeps the snake in a relatively safe position.\n\n**Strategy for next turn**: After moving up, I will assess the board again to determine the best path to the apple at (7, 4) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements.\n\n**Next move**: UP"
