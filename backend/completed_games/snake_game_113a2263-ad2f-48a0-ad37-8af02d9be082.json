If the enemy snake also moves towards (3, 2), I should immediately change direction to avoid a collision.\n3. After eating the apple, look for the next closest apple while staying away from the enemy snake and board edges.\n\nThinking out loud:\nThe apple at (3, 2) is the most tempting target, but I need to be ready to change course if the enemy snake also goes for it.

Instead, I can move up to (2, 2) and then plan to move left towards the apple at (0, 1) on the subsequent turn. This way, I create a buffer space between my snake and Snake #1, reducing the risk of an immediate collision.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (0, 1), I will have a clear path to move up and collect the apples at (0, 1) and (0, 3) without any immediate threats from Snake #1. My long-term strategy will be to prioritize collecting apples that are in safe positions, while constantly monitoring the positions of the other snakes to avoid potential collisions.\n\nFor the next move: UP."
