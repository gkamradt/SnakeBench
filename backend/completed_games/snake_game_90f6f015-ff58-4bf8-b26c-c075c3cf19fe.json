Move towards the middle row, potentially weakening the danger posed by Snake 1.\n\nConsidering these factors, we should prioritize safety while trying to move towards the closest apple. Moving \"UP\" allows us to increase the distance from Snake #1 and keeps us closer to reaching the next apple while navigating less hierarchical obstacles this way.\n\n**Logistical considerations**:\nOur path is to trying for the corners as much good progress can be achieved.\nFor instance move up to get on row 2, right to move to column 2, down and left to apple thereby avoiding complications for handling the Greater risk of Snake 1 continuing its moves ahead from us.\n\n**Next Move**:\nGiven the analysis, the next move should be **UP** to avoid immediate danger and position ourselves better for future moves towards the apple.\n\n**Decided next move**:\nUP."
