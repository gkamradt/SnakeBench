This will also give me more options for my next move.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (1,7). There are apples at (9,7), (9,0), (6,9), (7,4), and (1,9). I need to navigate to these apples without hitting walls, other snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should map out the board and see where everything is. The board ranges from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, I'm at (1,7), which is towards the bottom-left side of the board.\n\nLet me list out the positions again:\n\n- Apples: (9,7), (9,0), (6,9), (7,4), (1,9)\n\n- My position: (1,7)\n\n- Enemy snakes: Snake #1 at (9,4) with no body parts listed, so just the head at (9,4).\n\nI need to plan a path to get to the apples while avoiding the enemy snake and any part of my own body. Since this is a multi-apple game, I can collect multiple apples in one go, which would be beneficial.\n\nLet me consider the distances to each apple from my current position:\n\n1. (9,7): That's directly to the right. Horizontally, it's 9-1=8 steps to the right.\n\n2. (9,0): That's to the right and down. Right 8 steps and down 7 steps.\n\n3. (6,9): That's to the right and up. Right 5 steps and up 2 steps.\n\n4. (7,4): That's to the right and down. Right 6 steps and down 3 steps.\n\n5. (1,9): That's straight up. Up 2 steps.\n\nSo, the closest apple is (1,9), which is only 2 steps up from my current position. That seems like an easy grab.\n\nBut I need to think about the bigger picture. If I go up to (1,9), I can pick up that apple, but then I need to decide where to go next. Maybe I can plan a path that allows me to pick up multiple apples in sequence without getting blocked by the enemy snake or hitting a wall.\n\nLet's look at the positions again:\n\n- I'm at (1,7).\n\n- Apple at (1,9): 2 steps up.\n\n- Apple at (7,4): 6 steps right and 3 steps down from my current position.\n\n- Apple at (6,9): 5 steps right and 2 steps up from my current position.\n\n- Apple at (9,0): 8 steps right and 7 steps down from my current position.\n\n- Apple at (9,7): 8 steps right from my current position.\n\nAlso, the enemy snake is at (9,4) with no body parts, so it's just the head. I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for the apple at (1,9) first, since it's the closest, and then see from there which apple to go for next.\n\nWait, but if I go up to (1,9), then I can consider moving right towards the apple at (6,9), which is nearby.\n\nFrom (1,9), moving right to (6,9) would be 5 steps to the right.\n\nThen, from there, I could consider moving down towards the apple at (9,7), which is 2 steps down and 4 steps to the right.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that I don't get blocked by the enemy snake in the process.\n\nLet me think about the enemy snake's position. It's at (9,4), and it's snake #1. I don't know its length or direction, but since its body is empty, it's probably just the head.\n\nI need to predict where it might move. If it's trying to get to apples as well, it might go for the apple at (9,7), which is nearby, or the one at (9,0).\n\nAssuming it goes for (9,7), which is closer, I need to make sure that I get there before it or find a way to block it.\n\nBut, I'm quite far from (9,7), and the enemy is closer. It's at (9,4), so it's only 3 steps up to (9,7).\n\nI'm at (1,7), and to get to (9,7), I need to move right 8 steps.\n\nThat seems risky, as the enemy can get to (9,7) much faster.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should aim for a different apple.\n\nLet's consider the apple at (6,9). It's 5 steps to the right and 2 steps up from my current position.\n\nFrom there, I can potentially go down to (6,4), which is towards the apple at (7,4), but that might put me in the path of the enemy.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I should simplify my approach.\n\nOption 1: Go for the closest apple at (1,9), pick it up, grow, then decide where to go next.\n\nOption 2: Try to go directly for the apple at (9,7), but that's risky because the enemy is closer to it.\n\nOption 3: Aim for the apple at (6,9), which is somewhat in the center, and then decide based on the enemy's movement.\n\nI think Option 1 makes the most sense initially. Go for the closest apple to secure at least one point and gain some length.\n\nSo, from (1,7), I need to move up to (1,9).\n\nThat's two steps up.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that the path is clear. Is there any part of my body in the way? According to the last move information, direction was none, and rationale was none, which might mean that this is the starting position or the beginning of my turn.\n\nAssuming that my body is only at (1,7) since no other parts are mentioned, moving up to (1,8) and then to (1,9) should be safe.\n\nOnce I reach (1,9), I'll pick up the apple, and my snake will grow by one segment.\n\nNow, from (1,9), I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (9,7)\n\n- (9,0)\n\n- (7,4)\n\n- (6,9)\n\nI need to prioritize which one to go for next.\n\nThe apple at (6,9) is adjacent to my position at (1,9), only 5 steps to the right.\n\nBut, moving right from (1,9) to (6,9) would take me closer to the enemy, who is at (9,4).\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving down towards the apple at (7,4).\n\nBut, moving down from (1,9) would take me towards (1,8), (1,7), and so on.\n\nWait, but I need to be careful not to hit myself. Since I've grown by one segment after picking up the apple at (1,9), my tail will be at (1,7).\n\nSo, if I move from (1,9) to (1,8), then to (1,7), that's fine because the tail moves to (1,8), so I don't hit myself.\n\nBut, if I continue moving down to (1,6), my tail would be at (1,7), so I need to make sure that I don't move to a position that would cause my head to collide with my body.\n\nThis is getting a bit tricky.\n\nMaybe instead of going down, I should consider moving right towards the apple at (6,9).\n\nFrom (1,9), moving right to (6,9) is 5 steps.\n\nI need to ensure that the path is clear.\n\nAssuming that my body grows as I move, I need to keep track of my body segments.\n\nAfter picking up the apple at (1,9), my body is now at (1,7) and (1,9), assuming that the tail is at (1,7) and the head is at (1,9).\n\nIf I move right to (2,9), then my body becomes (1,7), (1,9), and (2,9), with the tail moving from (1,7) to (1,8).\n\nWait, actually, in Snake games, the tail moves to where the body was previously.\n\nWait, no, in classic Snake, the snake has a head and a body. As the head moves, the body follows.\n\nSo, if I move from (1,9) to (2,9), the tail moves from (1,7) to (1,8).\n\nWait, but in reality, each segment moves to the position of the segment ahead of it.\n\nSo, if my snake is currently at (1,7) and (1,9), and I move the head to (2,9), then the tail moves from (1,7) to (1,9), and the body follows.\n\nWait, but that doesn't make sense because the body is already at (1,9).\n\nI think I need to clarify how the snake's body moves.\n\nIn Snake games, typically, the snake has a head and a body. When the head moves to a new position, the tail moves to the position where the head was previously, and all body segments shift accordingly.\n\nIn this case, since I just picked up"
