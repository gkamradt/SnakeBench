There are no apples here, and no walls or enemy snakes, but it doesn't help my score.\n   \n2. **DOWN (to (7, 5)):** This is also a safe move where there are no apples but positions me below. No immediate threats here either.\n\n3. **LEFT (to (6, 6)):** This puts me next to the enemy snake at (4, 6). As I'm moving left, I wouldn't be running into it, but I open myself to potential threats in the next turn depending on where the enemy snake moves.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (8, 6)):** This position is also clear and moves me closer to the apples located at (8, 0) and potentially (7, 0). However, going right might leave me less flexibility for future moves.\n\nGiven the enemy's proximity, it may be wise for me to avoid conflicting territory. The strategic move would be to position myself closer to the apples without moving next to the enemy snake.\n\n### Decision: I\u2019ll go **DOWN** to (7, 5). \n\nNext turn I should look to move towards (1, 6) or one of the apples on the right side, keeping an eye out for the enemy's moves. \n\n**Next move: DOWN.**"

However, it's the cell where you just came from, so it doesn't help your growth.\n\n2. **DOWN (to (7, 4)):** This is a safe move, but again, it doesn't lead towards any apples. You would just be moving further away from the apple on (1, 6).\n\n3. **LEFT (to (6, 5)):** This is safe and doesn't lead into any enemy territory. However, it doesn't move you towards any apples.\n\n4. **RIGHT (to (8, 5)):** This move is also safe. It moves you closer to the apples at (8, 0) and keeps the enemy out of immediate danger, giving you more options next turn.\n\n### Deciding on the Strategy:\nSince the primary goal is to collect apples, and the apples at (7, 0) and (8, 0) are the closest, moving RIGHT to (8, 5) gives the best potential for future moves, especially since one of those apples is directly below this position. \n\nThe enemy snake is at (3, 6), which means that as long as I stay away from that area and don't move into its space (4, 6), I should be fine.\n\n### Decision:\nI choose to move **RIGHT** to (8, 5). \n\nNext turn, I will aim to move towards (8, 0) or (7, 0) depending on whether the enemy snake approaches or if new opportunities arise. \n\n**Next move: RIGHT.**"

Not an option.\n4. **RIGHT to (9, 5):** This would move me off the board which is not allowed.\n\n### Best Moves:\nGiven the above options, both UP and DOWN are valid moves. However, moving DOWN to (8, 4) is the most strategic as it maintains a direct line to the apple at (8, 0) during the following turns.\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward:\n1. Move towards (8, 0) to secure the apple there on the next turn.\n2. Keep an eye on the enemy snake position. Since it's located far away, I should not be at risk from it this turn.\n3. There are no immediate threats, so it's safe to focus on consuming apples.\n\n### Next Move:\nAfter considering all available options and assessing the board state, I will move **DOWN** from (8, 5) to (8, 4), putting me in a prime position next turn to move to (8, 0).\n\n**Decided next move: DOWN.**"
