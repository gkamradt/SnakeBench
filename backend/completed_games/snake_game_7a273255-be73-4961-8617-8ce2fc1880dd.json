There's an apple at (6, 0) directly in front of me and it's the closest.  Moving straight up isn't a smart idea because there's also a snake at (4, 5).  I should go to the apple.  Moving right might get me an apple more quickly and I wouldn't collide with the other snake.  \n\nMy strategy for the next turn will be to prioritize reaching apples in a straight line, avoiding the enemy snake at (4,5) and checking my surroundings.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

I see five apples scattered around the board, and I need to get to them to grow and gain points.\n\nMy first thought is to head towards the nearest apple, which is at position (4, 8). It's relatively close to my current position, so I think I'll make a move towards it.\n\nStrategy: I'll try to get as close to the apple as possible before deciding what to do next. If I can get to the apple, I'll eat it and grow. If not, I'll reassess my options and try to find a new path.\n\nNext move: UP"
