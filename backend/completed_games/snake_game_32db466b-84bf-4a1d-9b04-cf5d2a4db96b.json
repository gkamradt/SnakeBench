Snake #2 is at (8, 7), just above my current position\n2. The apple at (8, 8) is the closest and most direct target\n3. Moving UP would put me on the apple at (8, 8)\n4. No risk of collision with other snake if I move carefully\n\nStrategy for next turn: Move towards the closest apple at (8, 8) and potentially set up for collecting more apples on the left side later.\n\nPotential risks:\n- Snake #2 might move, so I'll need to be cautious in future moves\n- Need to avoid trapping myself\n\nThinking through the move... the apple at (8, 8) is the most logical and safe choice.\n\nNext move: UP"
          },
          "2": {
            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm the snake at (8,7), which is position 2 on the board. The apples are at (8,8), (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,6). The enemy snake is at (8,6) with an empty body. So, snake #1 is right below me at (8,6). \n\nFirst, I need to figure out possible moves. The directions I can go are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. Let's check each direction's safety and potential for apples.\n\nStarting with UP: Moving up from (8,7) would take me to (8,8). Oh, there's an apple there! If I go UP, I can eat that apple and grow. But wait, is that safe? Let's check. The next position (8,8) is within the 10x10 grid. The enemy snake is at (8,6), so moving up doesn't collide with them. Also, since my snake's body is only at (8,7) right now (assuming the body is just the head since there's no mention of a longer body), moving up won't hit myself. So UP seems good for getting the apple and safe.\n\nDOWN: Moving down from (8,7) would take me to (8,6). But snake #1 is already there. That's a collision, so DOWN is dangerous. Can't go there.\n\nLEFT: Moving left from (8,7) would be to (7,7). Is that square safe? The board shows at row 7 (y=7), there are apples at (1,7) and (2,7), but (7,7) is empty. So moving left to (7,7) is safe. But there's no apple there. So that's a safe move but doesn't get points. Maybe a backup option if UP is blocked, but UP seems better.\n\nRIGHT: Moving right from (8,7) would take me to (9,7). Wait, the board's x-coordinate goes up to 9. So (9,7) is valid. But is there anything there? The board state shows at x=9, y=7 is empty. So moving right is safe, but again no apple. So same as left, but maybe less strategic.\n\nSo the best option seems to be UP to get the apple at (8,8). That gives me a point and grows my snake. Then next turn, I'll have to plan again. But I need to make sure that after moving up, I don't get stuck. Let's think: after moving to (8,8), the next possible moves would be UP to (8,9), which is the top right corner. But there's no apple there. Alternatively, left to (7,8), right is (9,8) which is valid. But maybe after eating the apple, I can plan a path towards other apples. The other apples are on the left side at (1,7), (1,9), (2,7), (2,6). But those are far. Maybe after getting the nearby apple, I can start moving left towards those areas, avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nWait, the enemy snake is at (8,6). If I go UP to (8,8), then next move, the enemy is at (8,6). They might move up as well, but since their body is empty, maybe they are just a head. So they could move in any direction. But for now, the immediate move is safe. \n\nSo the best move is UP to get the apple. No immediate threats there. The other directions either lead to danger (DOWN) or don't get points. So I should choose UP.\n</think>\n\nUP  \nRationale: Moving UP to (8,8) allows me to safely collect the apple there, gaining a point without risking collision with the enemy snake or walls. This positions me to plan future moves towards other apples.  \nNext move: UP"
