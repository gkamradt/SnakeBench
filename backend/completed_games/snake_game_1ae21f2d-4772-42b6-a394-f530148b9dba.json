Therefore, I can prioritize reaching the nearest apple rather than focusing on avoiding potential conflicts with the enemy. \n\nThe nearest apples to me are placed at coordinates (2,7) and (8,7). Considering that I am presently at coordinates (5,9), I can either keep decreasing my x coordinate to reach the apple at (2,7), or increase my x coordinate to reach the one at (8,7). Since I last moved to the left in the previous turn, it would be more efficient to continue in the same direction and target the apple at (2,7).\n\nThe strategy for the next turn would be to keep moving left until I reach the x coordinate (2), and then move down towards the apple. However, I will re-evaluate this strategy in the next turn based on the movements of the enemy snake and its proximity to my snake.\n\nConsidering the present scenario and strategizing for the nearest apple, my next move is LEFT."
