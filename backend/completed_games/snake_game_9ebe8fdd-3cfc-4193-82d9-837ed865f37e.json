            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me try to visualize the board first based on the information given.\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake, which is snake ID 2, is currently at position (9,5). So that's the far right column, somewhere in the middle vertically. My goal is to collect apples to grow and gain points without dying.\n\nLooking at the apples, they are at these positions: (8,6), (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2). So I have five apples on the board. My snake is at (9,5), so I need to see which direction to go next to reach an apple without causing any collisions.\n\nEnemy snakes: Snake #1 is at (1,3), with an empty body list. So snake #1 is at (1,3), which is on the left side near the bottom. I need to make sure my path doesn't cross snake #1, or I'll die.\n\nFirst, I should think about potential directions. From (9,5), possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. But wait, moving RIGHT isn't possible because x=9 is the maximum x-coordinate, so moving right would take me to x=10, which is outside the board\u2014so that's a wall. So moving right would cause me to run into a wall and die. So I can eliminate RIGHT as an option.\n\nNext, let's consider moving LEFT, which would decrease the x-coordinate. If I move left, my next position would be (8,5). Is that a good move? Let me check if there's an apple there. Looking at the apples: (8,6) is an apple. So (8,5) is one below that. If I go to (8,5), am I safe? There's no immediate threat there. But my goal is to get to an apple, so moving to (8,5) would put me one step closer to the apple at (8,6). Then, next turn, I could move UP to (8,6) to collect the apple. That seems promising.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about moving UP or DOWN from (9,5). Moving UP would take me to (9,6). Is there an apple nearby? The apple at (8,6) is to the left of (9,6), so it's adjacent. But snake #1 is far away at (1,3), so maybe that's not a direct threat. However, to reach that apple from (9,6), I'd have to move left to (8,6). But I'm not sure if that's better than moving left first.\n\nIf I move DOWN from (9,5) to (9,4), is there an apple nearby? Looking at the apples, there's one at (7,9) and (4,9), which are at higher y-coordinates, so moving down would take me away from them. Also, (1,2) is far away, so it's not helpful to go down towards y=2 when I'm at y=5.\n\nWait, another thought: after moving left to (8,5), the next move up would get me the apple. That seems like a solid plan because it's a direct path with two moves, and there's no obstruction in between. Also, moving left from (9,5) to (8,5) doesn't put me in any immediate danger, as snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away.\n\nAnother consideration: The wall at x=9 is on the right, but moving left is safe as x=8 is within the board. Are there any other snakes near (8,5)? The only enemy is at (1,3), so no conflict there.\n\nLooking at the apples again, the ones at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9) are all at y=9, which is the top row. That's pretty far from my current position. The apple at (1,2) is on the left side, lower part. The closest apple to me is (8,6), which is to the left one and up one from my current position. So it's two moves away: left then up.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up first to (9,6), then left to (8,6) to get the apple. So that's two moves as well. Either way, it's two steps. But which path is safer?\n\nLet me consider the direction of each move. If I go left first, from (9,5) to (8,5), then up to (8,6). Alternatively, if I go up first to (9,6), then left to (8,6). Either way, both require two moves.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer one over the other? Let me check the surrounding areas. Moving left first might be better because when I'm at (9,6), I'm one step away from the wall on the top, so moving down from there is still possible. But if I go up first, I don't think it matters because I can still move down or left.\n\nWait, another thought: when I move left to (8,5), my next move would be to go up to (8,6) to collect the apple. After that, I would have grown, so my snake's body would be from (9,5) to (8,5) to (8,6). But the initial move from (9,5) to (8,5) is just the head moving, so my body would follow. Wait, no, in this game, every move the head moves, and the body follows, but since I'm starting with just the head at (9,5), moving left would put my head at (8,5), and the body isn't there yet, so I don't have to worry about running into myself yet.\n\nWait, actually, according to the rules, if I run into myself, I die. Since I'm just the head at (9,5), and I move to (8,5), my body isn't present elsewhere, so that's safe. So the path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving up first to (9,6) is also possible, but then I can move left to (8,6) to get the apple. Either way, it's two moves, but perhaps moving left first is more efficient because then I'm moving towards the center, which might give more flexibility for future moves.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move left first, I'm getting closer to the apple at (8,6), which is the closest one. If I move up first, I'm moving towards the top, but the apples are at y=9, which is a bit further. So perhaps moving left is better because it gets me closer to an apple in two moves.\n\nWait, but moving up first would get me to (9,6), which is adjacent to (8,6), so that's also a good move.\n\nI'm not sure which one is better. Either way, I can get to (8,6) in two moves. But perhaps moving left first is better because it's a more direct approach to the apple without getting too high on the board, which might have more walls nearby.\n\nLet me also think about the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (1,3). That's on the left side, but far from my current position. If I start moving left towards (8,5) and then up, I don't think snake #1 will interfere because it's too far away.\n\nAnother consideration: after collecting the apple at (8,6), where should I go next? There's another apple at (7,9), which is further left and up. Maybe I can plan a path after that, but perhaps I should focus on one apple at a time.\n\nSo, weighing the options:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (8,5) is a safe move, no immediate threats, and brings me closer to the apple at (8,6).\n\n- Moving UP to (9,6) is also safe, but I'm at the edge of the board, so I have to be careful about the wall at x=9 if I go further.\n\nI think moving LEFT is the better option because it moves me away from the right wall and towards the center, which gives me more flexibility for future moves. Plus, moving left first gets me closer to the apple in two moves.\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT. Then, in the following move, I can go UP to collect the apple. That makes sense.\n\nI should also check if there are any other possible threats or apples nearby, but it doesn't seem so. The other apples are farther away, and snake #1 is too far to pose an immediate threat.\n\nAnother thought: after I move LEFT to (8,5), will there be any possibility of collision with my own body? Since I'm just moving the head, and my body doesn't extend beyond that yet, I don't think so. So it's safe.\n\nAlright, I think I'll go with moving LEFT to (8,5) next. That's my next move.\n</think>\n\nMy next move is LEFT to position (8,5), moving towards the apple at (8,6). This brings me closer to the nearest apple without immediate threats and opens up more options for future moves.\n\nLEFT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me try to visualize the board first based on the information given.\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake, which is snake ID 2, is currently at position (9,5). So that's the far right column, somewhere in the middle vertically. My goal is to collect apples to grow and gain points without dying.\n\nLooking at the apples, they are at these positions: (8,6), (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2). So I have five apples on the board. My snake is at (9,5), so I need to see which direction to go next to reach an apple without causing any collisions.\n\nEnemy snakes: Snake #1 is at (1,3), with an empty body list. So snake #1 is at (1,3), which is on the left side near the bottom. I need to make sure my path doesn't cross snake #1, or I'll die.\n\nFirst, I should think about potential directions. From (9,5), possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. But wait, moving RIGHT isn't possible because x=9 is the maximum x-coordinate, so moving right would take me to x=10, which is outside the board\u2014so that's a wall. So moving right would cause me to run into a wall and die. So I can eliminate RIGHT as an option.\n\nNext, let's consider moving LEFT, which would decrease the x-coordinate. If I move left, my next position would be (8,5). Is that a good move? Let me check if there's an apple there. Looking at the apples: (8,6) is an apple. So (8,5) is one below that. If I go to (8,5), am I safe? There's no immediate threat there. But my goal is to get to an apple, so moving to (8,5) would put me one step closer to the apple at (8,6). Then, next turn, I could move UP to (8,6) to collect the apple. That seems promising.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about moving UP or DOWN from (9,5). Moving UP would take me to (9,6). Is there an apple nearby? The apple at (8,6) is to the left of (9,6), so it's adjacent. But snake #1 is far away at (1,3), so maybe that's not a direct threat. However, to reach that apple from (9,6), I'd have to move left to (8,6). But I'm not sure if that's better than moving left first.\n\nIf I move DOWN from (9,5) to (9,4), is there an apple nearby? Looking at the apples, there's one at (7,9) and (4,9), which are at higher y-coordinates, so moving down would take me away from them. Also, (1,2) is far away, so it's not helpful to go down towards y=2 when I'm at y=5.\n\nWait, another thought: after moving left to (8,5), the next move up would get me the apple. That seems like a solid plan because it's a direct path with two moves, and there's no obstruction in between. Also, moving left from (9,5) to (8,5) doesn't put me in any immediate danger, as snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away.\n\nAnother consideration: The wall at x=9 is on the right, but moving left is safe as x=8 is within the board. Are there any other snakes near (8,5)? The only enemy is at (1,3), so no conflict there.\n\nLooking at the apples again, the ones at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9) are all at y=9, which is the top row. That's pretty far from my current position. The apple at (1,2) is on the left side, lower part. The closest apple to me is (8,6), which is to the left one and up one from my current position. So it's two moves away: left then up.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up first to (9,6), then left to (8,6) to get the apple. So that's two moves as well. Either way, it's two steps. But which path is safer?\n\nLet me consider the direction of each move. If I go left first, from (9,5) to (8,5), then up to (8,6). Alternatively, if I go up first to (9,6), then left to (8,6). Either way, both require two moves.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer one over the other? Let me check the surrounding areas. Moving left first might be better because when I'm at (9,6), I'm one step away from the wall on the top, so moving down from there is still possible. But if I go up first, I don't think it matters because I can still move down or left.\n\nWait, another thought: when I move left to (8,5), my next move would be to go up to (8,6) to collect the apple. After that, I would have grown, so my snake's body would be from (9,5) to (8,5) to (8,6). But the initial move from (9,5) to (8,5) is just the head moving, so my body would follow. Wait, no, in this game, every move the head moves, and the body follows, but since I'm starting with just the head at (9,5), moving left would put my head at (8,5), and the body isn't there yet, so I don't have to worry about running into myself yet.\n\nWait, actually, according to the rules, if I run into myself, I die. Since I'm just the head at (9,5), and I move to (8,5), my body isn't present elsewhere, so that's safe. So the path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving up first to (9,6) is also possible, but then I can move left to (8,6) to get the apple. Either way, it's two moves, but perhaps moving left first is more efficient because then I'm moving towards the center, which might give more flexibility for future moves.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move left first, I'm getting closer to the apple at (8,6), which is the closest one. If I move up first, I'm moving towards the top, but the apples are at y=9, which is a bit further. So perhaps moving left is better because it gets me closer to an apple in two moves.\n\nWait, but moving up first would get me to (9,6), which is adjacent to (8,6), so that's also a good move.\n\nI'm not sure which one is better. Either way, I can get to (8,6) in two moves. But perhaps moving left first is better because it's a more direct approach to the apple without getting too high on the board, which might have more walls nearby.\n\nLet me also think about the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (1,3). That's on the left side, but far from my current position. If I start moving left towards (8,5) and then up, I don't think snake #1 will interfere because it's too far away.\n\nAnother consideration: after collecting the apple at (8,6), where should I go next? There's another apple at (7,9), which is further left and up. Maybe I can plan a path after that, but perhaps I should focus on one apple at a time.\n\nSo, weighing the options:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (8,5) is a safe move, no immediate threats, and brings me closer to the apple at (8,6).\n\n- Moving UP to (9,6) is also safe, but I'm at the edge of the board, so I have to be careful about the wall at x=9 if I go further.\n\nI think moving LEFT is the better option because it moves me away from the right wall and towards the center, which gives me more flexibility for future moves. Plus, moving left first gets me closer to the apple in two moves.\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT. Then, in the following move, I can go UP to collect the apple. That makes sense.\n\nI should also check if there are any other possible threats or apples nearby, but it doesn't seem so. The other apples are farther away, and snake #1 is too far to pose an immediate threat.\n\nAnother thought: after I move LEFT to (8,5), will there be any possibility of collision with my own body? Since I'm just moving the head, and my body doesn't extend beyond that yet, I don't think so. So it's safe.\n\nAlright, I think I'll go with moving LEFT to (8,5) next. That's my next move.\n</think>\n\nMy next move is LEFT to position (8,5), moving towards the apple at (8,6). This brings me closer to the nearest apple without immediate threats and opens up more options for future moves.\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm in control of snake ID 2, currently positioned at (8,6). I just collected an apple at (8,6), which means I've grown and now have that point. My last move was UP to get to this position. Now, I need to think about the next move carefully.\n\nFirst, let me update the board state in my mind. The apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and the one I just ate at (8,6). So now, the nearest apple to me is at (7,9). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and (9,9). I'm at (8,6), so perhaps I should check the positions again.\n\nWait, the apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and (9,9). So the closest one to me at (8,6) is actually the one at (9,9), which is to the right and up. Alternatively, there's also one at (7,9) which is to the left and up. Let me check the distances.\n\nDistance to (7,9): From (8,6) to (7,9). X difference is 1, Y difference is 3. Total steps: 4 moves.\n\nDistance to (9,9): From (8,6) to (9,9). X difference is 1, Y difference is 3. Also 4 moves.\n\nDistance to (4,9): That's further away, (8,6) to (4,9). X difference is 4, Y difference is 3. 7 moves.\n\nDistance to (3,9): Even further.\n\nDistance to (1,2): From (8,6) to (1,2) is X difference 7, Y difference 4. 11 moves, which is way too far.\n\nSo the closest apples are at (7,9) and (9,9), both 4 steps away. Now, I need to decide which path is safer and more direct.\n\nLooking at enemy snakes, snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away from me. So I don't have to worry about it for now. My snake's body is now from (8,6) extending to (8,5) and (9,5) if I've grown. Wait, actually, when I moved from (8,5) to (8,6), my body would follow, so my body segments would be at (8,6) as the head, (8,5), and (9,5). So I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nIf I decide to move towards (7,9), I need to go LEFT to (7,6), then UP to (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). Alternatively, moving towards (9,9), I can go RIGHT to (9,6), then UP to (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). Both paths are four steps, but I need to check if moving in any direction would cause me to collide with myself or another snake.\n\nMy current position is (8,6). If I move LEFT to (7,6), is that position clear? The board shows that (7,9) has an apple, but nothing about (7,6). So probably clear. Then moving UP each step from (7,6) to (7,9), which is an apple. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,6), which was my previous position, but now I've grown, so (9,5) is part of my body. Moving to (9,6) might be safe, but I need to check if it's occupied by enemy snakes or my body.\n\nWait, after moving from (9,5) to (8,5), and then to (8,6), my body would be (8,6) as head, followed by (8,5), then (9,5). So (9,5) is the tail. If I move to (9,6), that's a new square, so it's safe unless another snake is there, but from the last information, enemy snakes are at (1,3). So moving RIGHT to (9,6) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,6) is also safe because there's no apple there, and the enemy is far away.\n\nNow, I should consider which path might lead me to the apple while avoiding future collisions. If I go LEFT to (7,6), I can then move UP each step towards (7,9). Alternatively, going RIGHT to (9,6), then moving UP towards (9,9).\n\nBut wait, moving towards (9,9) would require me to go from (8,6) to (9,6), then (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). But (8,6) is my head, and (9,6) is next. Then each UP move would follow. However, I should check if moving into (9,6) is safe. Since my body is at (8,5) and (9,5), I don't think (9,6) is part of my body yet. So that's safe.\n\nOn the other hand, moving LEFT to (7,6) is also a clear path. I think either direction is viable. However, the path towards (9,9) might intercept with my body if I turn after that. Alternatively, moving towards (7,9) would take me away from my body.\n\nWait, another consideration: after I collect the apple, I should continue moving in a way that allows me to collect the next apple without running into myself. So perhaps moving towards (9,9) is better because it's closer in the X coordinate, but both are the same distance.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (7,9) because it's on the same X as another apple, but that might not matter immediately.\n\nI think I'll choose to move RIGHT to (9,6), then proceed UP towards (9,9). So my next move is RIGHT.\n\nWait, no, because I'm at (8,6), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,6). But I just moved from (8,6) to (9,6), and the next step is UP to (9,7), and so on. That should be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go LEFT to (7,6), then up to (7,9). Either path seems viable. Since both are equal, I can choose either. Let's pick moving towards (7,9) first because maybe that leads to less obstruction, but actually, it's the same.\n\nAlternatively, considering that moving RIGHT towards (9,9) might be more direct because it's a straight line, whereas moving LEFT and then UP might take the same number of steps. Since both are equal, I can choose either. I think I'll move LEFT first towards (7,9).\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. I'm at (8,6). To get to (7,9), I need to move LEFT to (7,6), then UP three steps to (7,9). To get to (9,9), I move RIGHT to (9,6), then UP three steps. Both require the same number of moves, 4 steps.\n\nBut considering the positions, moving towards (7,9) would take me into a less populated area, perhaps, while (9,9) is a corner. But since both are clear, it's a toss-up. I'll choose to move towards (9,9) as it's in the upper right, which might give me more space.\n\nTherefore, my next move is RIGHT to (9,6), then I can proceed UP towards (9,9).\n\nWait, but if I move RIGHT now, I'll be at (9,6). From there, next move will be UP to (9,7), then (9,8), then (9,9). So that's the plan.\n\nAlternatively, I could move LEFT to (7,6), then UP to (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), which also gets me to an apple.\n\nI think I'll go for (9,9) because it's in the corner, and less likely for the enemy snake to approach from there, but since the enemy is at (1,3), it's probably irrelevant.\n\nSo, I'll move RIGHT to (9,6) next.\n\nWait, but wait, I just realized that moving RIGHT to (9,6) would mean that my snake's body would now be at (8,6), (8,5), (9,5). So moving RIGHT to (9,6) is safe because that's a new square not occupied by my body yet.\n\nYes, so I think moving RIGHT is the way to go.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT\n\n**Rationale:** Moving RIGHT towards (9,6) starts the path to collect the apple at (9,9), which is safely accessible without immediate threats. This move avoids collision with my own body and enemy snakes, allowing for growth and point accumulation."

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me try to visualize the board first based on the information given.\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake, which is snake ID 2, is currently at position (9,5). So that's the far right column, somewhere in the middle vertically. My goal is to collect apples to grow and gain points without dying.\n\nLooking at the apples, they are at these positions: (8,6), (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2). So I have five apples on the board. My snake is at (9,5), so I need to see which direction to go next to reach an apple without causing any collisions.\n\nEnemy snakes: Snake #1 is at (1,3), with an empty body list. So snake #1 is at (1,3), which is on the left side near the bottom. I need to make sure my path doesn't cross snake #1, or I'll die.\n\nFirst, I should think about potential directions. From (9,5), possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. But wait, moving RIGHT isn't possible because x=9 is the maximum x-coordinate, so moving right would take me to x=10, which is outside the board\u2014so that's a wall. So moving right would cause me to run into a wall and die. So I can eliminate RIGHT as an option.\n\nNext, let's consider moving LEFT, which would decrease the x-coordinate. If I move left, my next position would be (8,5). Is that a good move? Let me check if there's an apple there. Looking at the apples: (8,6) is an apple. So (8,5) is one below that. If I go to (8,5), am I safe? There's no immediate threat there. But my goal is to get to an apple, so moving to (8,5) would put me one step closer to the apple at (8,6). Then, next turn, I could move UP to (8,6) to collect the apple. That seems promising.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about moving UP or DOWN from (9,5). Moving UP would take me to (9,6). Is there an apple nearby? The apple at (8,6) is to the left of (9,6), so it's adjacent. But snake #1 is far away at (1,3), so maybe that's not a direct threat. However, to reach that apple from (9,6), I'd have to move left to (8,6). But I'm not sure if that's better than moving left first.\n\nIf I move DOWN from (9,5) to (9,4), is there an apple nearby? Looking at the apples, there's one at (7,9) and (4,9), which are at higher y-coordinates, so moving down would take me away from them. Also, (1,2) is far away, so it's not helpful to go down towards y=2 when I'm at y=5.\n\nWait, another thought: after moving left to (8,5), the next move up would get me the apple. That seems like a solid plan because it's a direct path with two moves, and there's no obstruction in between. Also, moving left from (9,5) to (8,5) doesn't put me in any immediate danger, as snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away.\n\nAnother consideration: The wall at x=9 is on the right, but moving left is safe as x=8 is within the board. Are there any other snakes near (8,5)? The only enemy is at (1,3), so no conflict there.\n\nLooking at the apples again, the ones at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9) are all at y=9, which is the top row. That's pretty far from my current position. The apple at (1,2) is on the left side, lower part. The closest apple to me is (8,6), which is to the left one and up one from my current position. So it's two moves away: left then up.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up first to (9,6), then left to (8,6) to get the apple. So that's two moves as well. Either way, it's two steps. But which path is safer?\n\nLet me consider the direction of each move. If I go left first, from (9,5) to (8,5), then up to (8,6). Alternatively, if I go up first to (9,6), then left to (8,6). Either way, both require two moves.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer one over the other? Let me check the surrounding areas. Moving left first might be better because when I'm at (9,6), I'm one step away from the wall on the top, so moving down from there is still possible. But if I go up first, I don't think it matters because I can still move down or left.\n\nWait, another thought: when I move left to (8,5), my next move would be to go up to (8,6) to collect the apple. After that, I would have grown, so my snake's body would be from (9,5) to (8,5) to (8,6). But the initial move from (9,5) to (8,5) is just the head moving, so my body would follow. Wait, no, in this game, every move the head moves, and the body follows, but since I'm starting with just the head at (9,5), moving left would put my head at (8,5), and the body isn't there yet, so I don't have to worry about running into myself yet.\n\nWait, actually, according to the rules, if I run into myself, I die. Since I'm just the head at (9,5), and I move to (8,5), my body isn't present elsewhere, so that's safe. So the path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving up first to (9,6) is also possible, but then I can move left to (8,6) to get the apple. Either way, it's two moves, but perhaps moving left first is more efficient because then I'm moving towards the center, which might give more flexibility for future moves.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move left first, I'm getting closer to the apple at (8,6), which is the closest one. If I move up first, I'm moving towards the top, but the apples are at y=9, which is a bit further. So perhaps moving left is better because it gets me closer to an apple in two moves.\n\nWait, but moving up first would get me to (9,6), which is adjacent to (8,6), so that's also a good move.\n\nI'm not sure which one is better. Either way, I can get to (8,6) in two moves. But perhaps moving left first is better because it's a more direct approach to the apple without getting too high on the board, which might have more walls nearby.\n\nLet me also think about the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (1,3). That's on the left side, but far from my current position. If I start moving left towards (8,5) and then up, I don't think snake #1 will interfere because it's too far away.\n\nAnother consideration: after collecting the apple at (8,6), where should I go next? There's another apple at (7,9), which is further left and up. Maybe I can plan a path after that, but perhaps I should focus on one apple at a time.\n\nSo, weighing the options:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (8,5) is a safe move, no immediate threats, and brings me closer to the apple at (8,6).\n\n- Moving UP to (9,6) is also safe, but I'm at the edge of the board, so I have to be careful about the wall at x=9 if I go further.\n\nI think moving LEFT is the better option because it moves me away from the right wall and towards the center, which gives me more flexibility for future moves. Plus, moving left first gets me closer to the apple in two moves.\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT. Then, in the following move, I can go UP to collect the apple. That makes sense.\n\nI should also check if there are any other possible threats or apples nearby, but it doesn't seem so. The other apples are farther away, and snake #1 is too far to pose an immediate threat.\n\nAnother thought: after I move LEFT to (8,5), will there be any possibility of collision with my own body? Since I'm just moving the head, and my body doesn't extend beyond that yet, I don't think so. So it's safe.\n\nAlright, I think I'll go with moving LEFT to (8,5) next. That's my next move.\n</think>\n\nMy next move is LEFT to position (8,5), moving towards the apple at (8,6). This brings me closer to the nearest apple without immediate threats and opens up more options for future moves.\n\nLEFT"

Let me recap the situation.\n\nApples are at: (8,6), (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2). So the closest apple is right above me at (8,6). Enemy snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away, so I don't need to worry about it right now.\n\nFrom (8,5), I can move in four directions: UP to (8,6), DOWN to (8,4), LEFT to (7,5), or RIGHT back to (9,5). Since I just moved from (9,5) to (8,5), moving RIGHT back isn't helpful unless I'm trying to avoid something, which I'm not. So RIGHT is out.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4) takes me away from the apple, which is at (8,6). So that doesn't help. Moving LEFT to (7,5) also moves me away from the nearby apple. Therefore, the best move is UP to (8,6), which is exactly where the apple is. Moving UP will let me collect the apple, grow, and gain a point.\n\nI should also consider if moving UP poses any immediate threats. The wall is at y=9, so (8,6) is within bounds. No enemy snakes are nearby, so moving UP is safe.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (8,6), my snake will grow by one segment, so I need to be cautious about my body's position in future moves to avoid self-collision. But for now, the move is straightforward.\n\nSo, the next move should be UP to (8,6) to collect the apple. That's the logical step to take.\n</think>\n\nUP\n\n**Rationale:** Moving UP to (8,6) allows me to collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. This move is safe as there are no immediate threats."

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm in control of snake ID 2, currently positioned at (8,6). I just collected an apple at (8,6), which means I've grown and now have that point. My last move was UP to get to this position. Now, I need to think about the next move carefully.\n\nFirst, let me update the board state in my mind. The apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and the one I just ate at (8,6). So now, the nearest apple to me is at (7,9). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and (9,9). I'm at (8,6), so perhaps I should check the positions again.\n\nWait, the apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and (9,9). So the closest one to me at (8,6) is actually the one at (9,9), which is to the right and up. Alternatively, there's also one at (7,9) which is to the left and up. Let me check the distances.\n\nDistance to (7,9): From (8,6) to (7,9). X difference is 1, Y difference is 3. Total steps: 4 moves.\n\nDistance to (9,9): From (8,6) to (9,9). X difference is 1, Y difference is 3. Also 4 moves.\n\nDistance to (4,9): That's further away, (8,6) to (4,9). X difference is 4, Y difference is 3. 7 moves.\n\nDistance to (3,9): Even further.\n\nDistance to (1,2): From (8,6) to (1,2) is X difference 7, Y difference 4. 11 moves, which is way too far.\n\nSo the closest apples are at (7,9) and (9,9), both 4 steps away. Now, I need to decide which path is safer and more direct.\n\nLooking at enemy snakes, snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away from me. So I don't have to worry about it for now. My snake's body is now from (8,6) extending to (8,5) and (9,5) if I've grown. Wait, actually, when I moved from (8,5) to (8,6), my body would follow, so my body segments would be at (8,6) as the head, (8,5), and (9,5). So I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nIf I decide to move towards (7,9), I need to go LEFT to (7,6), then UP to (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). Alternatively, moving towards (9,9), I can go RIGHT to (9,6), then UP to (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). Both paths are four steps, but I need to check if moving in any direction would cause me to collide with myself or another snake.\n\nMy current position is (8,6). If I move LEFT to (7,6), is that position clear? The board shows that (7,9) has an apple, but nothing about (7,6). So probably clear. Then moving UP each step from (7,6) to (7,9), which is an apple. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,6), which was my previous position, but now I've grown, so (9,5) is part of my body. Moving to (9,6) might be safe, but I need to check if it's occupied by enemy snakes or my body.\n\nWait, after moving from (9,5) to (8,5), and then to (8,6), my body would be (8,6) as head, followed by (8,5), then (9,5). So (9,5) is the tail. If I move to (9,6), that's a new square, so it's safe unless another snake is there, but from the last information, enemy snakes are at (1,3). So moving RIGHT to (9,6) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,6) is also safe because there's no apple there, and the enemy is far away.\n\nNow, I should consider which path might lead me to the apple while avoiding future collisions. If I go LEFT to (7,6), I can then move UP each step towards (7,9). Alternatively, going RIGHT to (9,6), then moving UP towards (9,9).\n\nBut wait, moving towards (9,9) would require me to go from (8,6) to (9,6), then (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). But (8,6) is my head, and (9,6) is next. Then each UP move would follow. However, I should check if moving into (9,6) is safe. Since my body is at (8,5) and (9,5), I don't think (9,6) is part of my body yet. So that's safe.\n\nOn the other hand, moving LEFT to (7,6) is also a clear path. I think either direction is viable. However, the path towards (9,9) might intercept with my body if I turn after that. Alternatively, moving towards (7,9) would take me away from my body.\n\nWait, another consideration: after I collect the apple, I should continue moving in a way that allows me to collect the next apple without running into myself. So perhaps moving towards (9,9) is better because it's closer in the X coordinate, but both are the same distance.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (7,9) because it's on the same X as another apple, but that might not matter immediately.\n\nI think I'll choose to move RIGHT to (9,6), then proceed UP towards (9,9). So my next move is RIGHT.\n\nWait, no, because I'm at (8,6), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,6). But I just moved from (8,6) to (9,6), and the next step is UP to (9,7), and so on. That should be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go LEFT to (7,6), then up to (7,9). Either path seems viable. Since both are equal, I can choose either. Let's pick moving towards (7,9) first because maybe that leads to less obstruction, but actually, it's the same.\n\nAlternatively, considering that moving RIGHT towards (9,9) might be more direct because it's a straight line, whereas moving LEFT and then UP might take the same number of steps. Since both are equal, I can choose either. I think I'll move LEFT first towards (7,9).\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. I'm at (8,6). To get to (7,9), I need to move LEFT to (7,6), then UP three steps to (7,9). To get to (9,9), I move RIGHT to (9,6), then UP three steps. Both require the same number of moves, 4 steps.\n\nBut considering the positions, moving towards (7,9) would take me into a less populated area, perhaps, while (9,9) is a corner. But since both are clear, it's a toss-up. I'll choose to move towards (9,9) as it's in the upper right, which might give me more space.\n\nTherefore, my next move is RIGHT to (9,6), then I can proceed UP towards (9,9).\n\nWait, but if I move RIGHT now, I'll be at (9,6). From there, next move will be UP to (9,7), then (9,8), then (9,9). So that's the plan.\n\nAlternatively, I could move LEFT to (7,6), then UP to (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), which also gets me to an apple.\n\nI think I'll go for (9,9) because it's in the corner, and less likely for the enemy snake to approach from there, but since the enemy is at (1,3), it's probably irrelevant.\n\nSo, I'll move RIGHT to (9,6) next.\n\nWait, but wait, I just realized that moving RIGHT to (9,6) would mean that my snake's body would now be at (8,6), (8,5), (9,5). So moving RIGHT to (9,6) is safe because that's a new square not occupied by my body yet.\n\nYes, so I think moving RIGHT is the way to go.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT\n\n**Rationale:** Moving RIGHT towards (9,6) starts the path to collect the apple at (9,9), which is safely accessible without immediate threats. This move avoids collision with my own body and enemy snakes, allowing for growth and point accumulation."

But for now, let's focus on collecting this one first. I'll proceed UP to (9,7) next.\n\nWait, but is there any chance that moving UP could trap me? Since I'm at the edge, moving UP is straightforward, and there's nothing blocking me. So I think it's safe to move UP.\n\nAlternatively, do I have any reason to turn LEFT or anything? No, because the apple is directly UP, and there's no immediate danger in that path. So moving UP is the best choice.\n\nI should also consider the apples at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and (9,9). After collecting (9,9), I'll have to think about which apple to go for next, but that's for later.\n\nFor now, the plan is clear: move UP to (9,7), then to (9,8), and finally to (9,9) to collect that apple. I'll continue this path unless something changes.\n\nSo, my next move is UP.\n</think>\n\nUP\n\n**Rationale:** Moving UP towards (9,7) continues the path to the apple at (9,9). This move is safe, avoids collisions, and brings me closer to collecting the apple for growth and points. Next move will continue UP towards (9,8), maintaining the strategy to reach the apple at (9,9).\n\nUP"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me try to visualize the board first based on the information given.\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake, which is snake ID 2, is currently at position (9,5). So that's the far right column, somewhere in the middle vertically. My goal is to collect apples to grow and gain points without dying.\n\nLooking at the apples, they are at these positions: (8,6), (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2). So I have five apples on the board. My snake is at (9,5), so I need to see which direction to go next to reach an apple without causing any collisions.\n\nEnemy snakes: Snake #1 is at (1,3), with an empty body list. So snake #1 is at (1,3), which is on the left side near the bottom. I need to make sure my path doesn't cross snake #1, or I'll die.\n\nFirst, I should think about potential directions. From (9,5), possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. But wait, moving RIGHT isn't possible because x=9 is the maximum x-coordinate, so moving right would take me to x=10, which is outside the board\u2014so that's a wall. So moving right would cause me to run into a wall and die. So I can eliminate RIGHT as an option.\n\nNext, let's consider moving LEFT, which would decrease the x-coordinate. If I move left, my next position would be (8,5). Is that a good move? Let me check if there's an apple there. Looking at the apples: (8,6) is an apple. So (8,5) is one below that. If I go to (8,5), am I safe? There's no immediate threat there. But my goal is to get to an apple, so moving to (8,5) would put me one step closer to the apple at (8,6). Then, next turn, I could move UP to (8,6) to collect the apple. That seems promising.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about moving UP or DOWN from (9,5). Moving UP would take me to (9,6). Is there an apple nearby? The apple at (8,6) is to the left of (9,6), so it's adjacent. But snake #1 is far away at (1,3), so maybe that's not a direct threat. However, to reach that apple from (9,6), I'd have to move left to (8,6). But I'm not sure if that's better than moving left first.\n\nIf I move DOWN from (9,5) to (9,4), is there an apple nearby? Looking at the apples, there's one at (7,9) and (4,9), which are at higher y-coordinates, so moving down would take me away from them. Also, (1,2) is far away, so it's not helpful to go down towards y=2 when I'm at y=5.\n\nWait, another thought: after moving left to (8,5), the next move up would get me the apple. That seems like a solid plan because it's a direct path with two moves, and there's no obstruction in between. Also, moving left from (9,5) to (8,5) doesn't put me in any immediate danger, as snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away.\n\nAnother consideration: The wall at x=9 is on the right, but moving left is safe as x=8 is within the board. Are there any other snakes near (8,5)? The only enemy is at (1,3), so no conflict there.\n\nLooking at the apples again, the ones at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9) are all at y=9, which is the top row. That's pretty far from my current position. The apple at (1,2) is on the left side, lower part. The closest apple to me is (8,6), which is to the left one and up one from my current position. So it's two moves away: left then up.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up first to (9,6), then left to (8,6) to get the apple. So that's two moves as well. Either way, it's two steps. But which path is safer?\n\nLet me consider the direction of each move. If I go left first, from (9,5) to (8,5), then up to (8,6). Alternatively, if I go up first to (9,6), then left to (8,6). Either way, both require two moves.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer one over the other? Let me check the surrounding areas. Moving left first might be better because when I'm at (9,6), I'm one step away from the wall on the top, so moving down from there is still possible. But if I go up first, I don't think it matters because I can still move down or left.\n\nWait, another thought: when I move left to (8,5), my next move would be to go up to (8,6) to collect the apple. After that, I would have grown, so my snake's body would be from (9,5) to (8,5) to (8,6). But the initial move from (9,5) to (8,5) is just the head moving, so my body would follow. Wait, no, in this game, every move the head moves, and the body follows, but since I'm starting with just the head at (9,5), moving left would put my head at (8,5), and the body isn't there yet, so I don't have to worry about running into myself yet.\n\nWait, actually, according to the rules, if I run into myself, I die. Since I'm just the head at (9,5), and I move to (8,5), my body isn't present elsewhere, so that's safe. So the path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving up first to (9,6) is also possible, but then I can move left to (8,6) to get the apple. Either way, it's two moves, but perhaps moving left first is more efficient because then I'm moving towards the center, which might give more flexibility for future moves.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move left first, I'm getting closer to the apple at (8,6), which is the closest one. If I move up first, I'm moving towards the top, but the apples are at y=9, which is a bit further. So perhaps moving left is better because it gets me closer to an apple in two moves.\n\nWait, but moving up first would get me to (9,6), which is adjacent to (8,6), so that's also a good move.\n\nI'm not sure which one is better. Either way, I can get to (8,6) in two moves. But perhaps moving left first is better because it's a more direct approach to the apple without getting too high on the board, which might have more walls nearby.\n\nLet me also think about the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (1,3). That's on the left side, but far from my current position. If I start moving left towards (8,5) and then up, I don't think snake #1 will interfere because it's too far away.\n\nAnother consideration: after collecting the apple at (8,6), where should I go next? There's another apple at (7,9), which is further left and up. Maybe I can plan a path after that, but perhaps I should focus on one apple at a time.\n\nSo, weighing the options:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (8,5) is a safe move, no immediate threats, and brings me closer to the apple at (8,6).\n\n- Moving UP to (9,6) is also safe, but I'm at the edge of the board, so I have to be careful about the wall at x=9 if I go further.\n\nI think moving LEFT is the better option because it moves me away from the right wall and towards the center, which gives me more flexibility for future moves. Plus, moving left first gets me closer to the apple in two moves.\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT. Then, in the following move, I can go UP to collect the apple. That makes sense.\n\nI should also check if there are any other possible threats or apples nearby, but it doesn't seem so. The other apples are farther away, and snake #1 is too far to pose an immediate threat.\n\nAnother thought: after I move LEFT to (8,5), will there be any possibility of collision with my own body? Since I'm just moving the head, and my body doesn't extend beyond that yet, I don't think so. So it's safe.\n\nAlright, I think I'll go with moving LEFT to (8,5) next. That's my next move.\n</think>\n\nMy next move is LEFT to position (8,5), moving towards the apple at (8,6). This brings me closer to the nearest apple without immediate threats and opens up more options for future moves.\n\nLEFT"

Let me recap the situation.\n\nApples are at: (8,6), (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2). So the closest apple is right above me at (8,6). Enemy snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away, so I don't need to worry about it right now.\n\nFrom (8,5), I can move in four directions: UP to (8,6), DOWN to (8,4), LEFT to (7,5), or RIGHT back to (9,5). Since I just moved from (9,5) to (8,5), moving RIGHT back isn't helpful unless I'm trying to avoid something, which I'm not. So RIGHT is out.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4) takes me away from the apple, which is at (8,6). So that doesn't help. Moving LEFT to (7,5) also moves me away from the nearby apple. Therefore, the best move is UP to (8,6), which is exactly where the apple is. Moving UP will let me collect the apple, grow, and gain a point.\n\nI should also consider if moving UP poses any immediate threats. The wall is at y=9, so (8,6) is within bounds.

But for now, the move is straightforward.\n\nSo, the next move should be UP to (8,6) to collect the apple. That's the logical step to take.\n</think>\n\nUP\n\n**Rationale:** Moving UP to (8,6) allows me to collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. This move is safe as there are no immediate threats."

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm in control of snake ID 2, currently positioned at (8,6). I just collected an apple at (8,6), which means I've grown and now have that point. My last move was UP to get to this position. Now, I need to think about the next move carefully.\n\nFirst, let me update the board state in my mind. The apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and the one I just ate at (8,6). So now, the nearest apple to me is at (7,9). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and (9,9). I'm at (8,6), so perhaps I should check the positions again.\n\nWait, the apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and (9,9). So the closest one to me at (8,6) is actually the one at (9,9), which is to the right and up. Alternatively, there's also one at (7,9) which is to the left and up. Let me check the distances.\n\nDistance to (7,9): From (8,6) to (7,9). X difference is 1, Y difference is 3. Total steps: 4 moves.\n\nDistance to (9,9): From (8,6) to (9,9). X difference is 1, Y difference is 3. Also 4 moves.\n\nDistance to (4,9): That's further away, (8,6) to (4,9). X difference is 4, Y difference is 3. 7 moves.\n\nDistance to (3,9): Even further.\n\nDistance to (1,2): From (8,6) to (1,2) is X difference 7, Y difference 4. 11 moves, which is way too far.\n\nSo the closest apples are at (7,9) and (9,9), both 4 steps away. Now, I need to decide which path is safer and more direct.\n\nLooking at enemy snakes, snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away from me. So I don't have to worry about it for now. My snake's body is now from (8,6) extending to (8,5) and (9,5) if I've grown. Wait, actually, when I moved from (8,5) to (8,6), my body would follow, so my body segments would be at (8,6) as the head, (8,5), and (9,5). So I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nIf I decide to move towards (7,9), I need to go LEFT to (7,6), then UP to (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). Alternatively, moving towards (9,9), I can go RIGHT to (9,6), then UP to (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). Both paths are four steps, but I need to check if moving in any direction would cause me to collide with myself or another snake.\n\nMy current position is (8,6). If I move LEFT to (7,6), is that position clear? The board shows that (7,9) has an apple, but nothing about (7,6). So probably clear. Then moving UP each step from (7,6) to (7,9), which is an apple. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,6), which was my previous position, but now I've grown, so (9,5) is part of my body. Moving to (9,6) might be safe, but I need to check if it's occupied by enemy snakes or my body.\n\nWait, after moving from (9,5) to (8,5), and then to (8,6), my body would be (8,6) as head, followed by (8,5), then (9,5). So (9,5) is the tail. If I move to (9,6), that's a new square, so it's safe unless another snake is there, but from the last information, enemy snakes are at (1,3). So moving RIGHT to (9,6) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,6) is also safe because there's no apple there, and the enemy is far away.\n\nNow, I should consider which path might lead me to the apple while avoiding future collisions. If I go LEFT to (7,6), I can then move UP each step towards (7,9). Alternatively, going RIGHT to (9,6), then moving UP towards (9,9).\n\nBut wait, moving towards (9,9) would require me to go from (8,6) to (9,6), then (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). But (8,6) is my head, and (9,6) is next. Then each UP move would follow. However, I should check if moving into (9,6) is safe. Since my body is at (8,5) and (9,5), I don't think (9,6) is part of my body yet. So that's safe.\n\nOn the other hand, moving LEFT to (7,6) is also a clear path. I think either direction is viable. However, the path towards (9,9) might intercept with my body if I turn after that. Alternatively, moving towards (7,9) would take me away from my body.\n\nWait, another consideration: after I collect the apple, I should continue moving in a way that allows me to collect the next apple without running into myself. So perhaps moving towards (9,9) is better because it's closer in the X coordinate, but both are the same distance.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (7,9) because it's on the same X as another apple, but that might not matter immediately.\n\nI think I'll choose to move RIGHT to (9,6), then proceed UP towards (9,9). So my next move is RIGHT.\n\nWait, no, because I'm at (8,6), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,6). But I just moved from (8,6) to (9,6), and the next step is UP to (9,7), and so on. That should be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go LEFT to (7,6), then up to (7,9). Either path seems viable. Since both are equal, I can choose either. Let's pick moving towards (7,9) first because maybe that leads to less obstruction, but actually, it's the same.\n\nAlternatively, considering that moving RIGHT towards (9,9) might be more direct because it's a straight line, whereas moving LEFT and then UP might take the same number of steps. Since both are equal, I can choose either. I think I'll move LEFT first towards (7,9).\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. I'm at (8,6). To get to (7,9), I need to move LEFT to (7,6), then UP three steps to (7,9). To get to (9,9), I move RIGHT to (9,6), then UP three steps. Both require the same number of moves, 4 steps.\n\nBut considering the positions, moving towards (7,9) would take me into a less populated area, perhaps, while (9,9) is a corner. But since both are clear, it's a toss-up. I'll choose to move towards (9,9) as it's in the upper right, which might give me more space.\n\nTherefore, my next move is RIGHT to (9,6), then I can proceed UP towards (9,9).\n\nWait, but if I move RIGHT now, I'll be at (9,6). From there, next move will be UP to (9,7), then (9,8), then (9,9). So that's the plan.\n\nAlternatively, I could move LEFT to (7,6), then UP to (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), which also gets me to an apple.\n\nI think I'll go for (9,9) because it's in the corner, and less likely for the enemy snake to approach from there, but since the enemy is at (1,3), it's probably irrelevant.\n\nSo, I'll move RIGHT to (9,6) next.\n\nWait, but wait, I just realized that moving RIGHT to (9,6) would mean that my snake's body would now be at (8,6), (8,5), (9,5). So moving RIGHT to (9,6) is safe because that's a new square not occupied by my body yet.\n\nYes, so I think moving RIGHT is the way to go.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT\n\n**Rationale:** Moving RIGHT towards (9,6) starts the path to collect the apple at (9,9), which is safely accessible without immediate threats. This move avoids collision with my own body and enemy snakes, allowing for growth and point accumulation."

From my current position, that's just a few steps up. I should probably keep moving UP to reach that apple.\n\nWait, let me think about my body. My head is at (9,6), and my body is at (8,6), (8,5), and (9,5). So moving UP won't cause me to run into myself because I'm moving forward. If I go UP, I'll be at (9,7) next, which is clear. Then (9,8), and then (9,9) where the apple is.\n\nI should check if there are any obstacles or enemy snakes nearby. The enemy snake is at (1,3), which is far away, so I don't need to worry about it right now. The path up along the right edge seems clear.\n\nAnother thought: after collecting the apple at (9,9), I might want to turn around and head towards the next closest apple.

Since I'm at the edge, moving UP is straightforward, and there's nothing blocking me. So I think it's safe to move UP.\n\nAlternatively, do I have any reason to turn LEFT or anything? No, because the apple is directly UP, and there's no immediate danger in that path. So moving UP is the best choice.\n\nI should also consider the apples at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and (9,9). After collecting (9,9), I'll have to think about which apple to go for next, but that's for later.\n\nFor now, the plan is clear: move UP to (9,7), then to (9,8), and finally to (9,9) to collect that apple.

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me try to visualize the board first based on the information given.\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake, which is snake ID 2, is currently at position (9,5). So that's the far right column, somewhere in the middle vertically. My goal is to collect apples to grow and gain points without dying.\n\nLooking at the apples, they are at these positions: (8,6), (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2). So I have five apples on the board. My snake is at (9,5), so I need to see which direction to go next to reach an apple without causing any collisions.\n\nEnemy snakes: Snake #1 is at (1,3), with an empty body list. So snake #1 is at (1,3), which is on the left side near the bottom. I need to make sure my path doesn't cross snake #1, or I'll die.\n\nFirst, I should think about potential directions. From (9,5), possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. But wait, moving RIGHT isn't possible because x=9 is the maximum x-coordinate, so moving right would take me to x=10, which is outside the board\u2014so that's a wall. So moving right would cause me to run into a wall and die. So I can eliminate RIGHT as an option.\n\nNext, let's consider moving LEFT, which would decrease the x-coordinate. If I move left, my next position would be (8,5). Is that a good move? Let me check if there's an apple there. Looking at the apples: (8,6) is an apple. So (8,5) is one below that. If I go to (8,5), am I safe? There's no immediate threat there. But my goal is to get to an apple, so moving to (8,5) would put me one step closer to the apple at (8,6). Then, next turn, I could move UP to (8,6) to collect the apple. That seems promising.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about moving UP or DOWN from (9,5). Moving UP would take me to (9,6). Is there an apple nearby? The apple at (8,6) is to the left of (9,6), so it's adjacent. But snake #1 is far away at (1,3), so maybe that's not a direct threat. However, to reach that apple from (9,6), I'd have to move left to (8,6). But I'm not sure if that's better than moving left first.\n\nIf I move DOWN from (9,5) to (9,4), is there an apple nearby? Looking at the apples, there's one at (7,9) and (4,9), which are at higher y-coordinates, so moving down would take me away from them. Also, (1,2) is far away, so it's not helpful to go down towards y=2 when I'm at y=5.\n\nWait, another thought: after moving left to (8,5), the next move up would get me the apple. That seems like a solid plan because it's a direct path with two moves, and there's no obstruction in between. Also, moving left from (9,5) to (8,5) doesn't put me in any immediate danger, as snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away.\n\nAnother consideration: The wall at x=9 is on the right, but moving left is safe as x=8 is within the board. Are there any other snakes near (8,5)? The only enemy is at (1,3), so no conflict there.\n\nLooking at the apples again, the ones at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9) are all at y=9, which is the top row. That's pretty far from my current position. The apple at (1,2) is on the left side, lower part. The closest apple to me is (8,6), which is to the left one and up one from my current position. So it's two moves away: left then up.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up first to (9,6), then left to (8,6) to get the apple. So that's two moves as well. Either way, it's two steps. But which path is safer?\n\nLet me consider the direction of each move. If I go left first, from (9,5) to (8,5), then up to (8,6). Alternatively, if I go up first to (9,6), then left to (8,6). Either way, both require two moves.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer one over the other? Let me check the surrounding areas. Moving left first might be better because when I'm at (9,6), I'm one step away from the wall on the top, so moving down from there is still possible. But if I go up first, I don't think it matters because I can still move down or left.\n\nWait, another thought: when I move left to (8,5), my next move would be to go up to (8,6) to collect the apple. After that, I would have grown, so my snake's body would be from (9,5) to (8,5) to (8,6). But the initial move from (9,5) to (8,5) is just the head moving, so my body would follow. Wait, no, in this game, every move the head moves, and the body follows, but since I'm starting with just the head at (9,5), moving left would put my head at (8,5), and the body isn't there yet, so I don't have to worry about running into myself yet.\n\nWait, actually, according to the rules, if I run into myself, I die. Since I'm just the head at (9,5), and I move to (8,5), my body isn't present elsewhere, so that's safe. So the path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving up first to (9,6) is also possible, but then I can move left to (8,6) to get the apple. Either way, it's two moves, but perhaps moving left first is more efficient because then I'm moving towards the center, which might give more flexibility for future moves.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move left first, I'm getting closer to the apple at (8,6), which is the closest one. If I move up first, I'm moving towards the top, but the apples are at y=9, which is a bit further. So perhaps moving left is better because it gets me closer to an apple in two moves.\n\nWait, but moving up first would get me to (9,6), which is adjacent to (8,6), so that's also a good move.\n\nI'm not sure which one is better. Either way, I can get to (8,6) in two moves. But perhaps moving left first is better because it's a more direct approach to the apple without getting too high on the board, which might have more walls nearby.\n\nLet me also think about the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (1,3). That's on the left side, but far from my current position. If I start moving left towards (8,5) and then up, I don't think snake #1 will interfere because it's too far away.\n\nAnother consideration: after collecting the apple at (8,6), where should I go next? There's another apple at (7,9), which is further left and up. Maybe I can plan a path after that, but perhaps I should focus on one apple at a time.\n\nSo, weighing the options:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (8,5) is a safe move, no immediate threats, and brings me closer to the apple at (8,6).\n\n- Moving UP to (9,6) is also safe, but I'm at the edge of the board, so I have to be careful about the wall at x=9 if I go further.\n\nI think moving LEFT is the better option because it moves me away from the right wall and towards the center, which gives me more flexibility for future moves. Plus, moving left first gets me closer to the apple in two moves.\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT. Then, in the following move, I can go UP to collect the apple. That makes sense.\n\nI should also check if there are any other possible threats or apples nearby, but it doesn't seem so. The other apples are farther away, and snake #1 is too far to pose an immediate threat.\n\nAnother thought: after I move LEFT to (8,5), will there be any possibility of collision with my own body? Since I'm just moving the head, and my body doesn't extend beyond that yet, I don't think so. So it's safe.\n\nAlright, I think I'll go with moving LEFT to (8,5) next. That's my next move.\n</think>\n\nMy next move is LEFT to position (8,5), moving towards the apple at (8,6). This brings me closer to the nearest apple without immediate threats and opens up more options for future moves.\n\nLEFT"

My last move was UP to get to this position. Now, I need to think about the next move carefully.\n\nFirst, let me update the board state in my mind. The apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and the one I just ate at (8,6). So now, the nearest apple to me is at (7,9). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and (9,9). I'm at (8,6), so perhaps I should check the positions again.\n\nWait, the apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and (9,9). So the closest one to me at (8,6) is actually the one at (9,9), which is to the right and up. Alternatively, there's also one at (7,9) which is to the left and up. Let me check the distances.\n\nDistance to (7,9): From (8,6) to (7,9). X difference is 1, Y difference is 3. Total steps: 4 moves.\n\nDistance to (9,9): From (8,6) to (9,9). X difference is 1, Y difference is 3. Also 4 moves.\n\nDistance to (4,9): That's further away, (8,6) to (4,9). X difference is 4, Y difference is 3. 7 moves.\n\nDistance to (3,9): Even further.\n\nDistance to (1,2): From (8,6) to (1,2) is X difference 7, Y difference 4. 11 moves, which is way too far.\n\nSo the closest apples are at (7,9) and (9,9), both 4 steps away. Now, I need to decide which path is safer and more direct.\n\nLooking at enemy snakes, snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away from me. So I don't have to worry about it for now. My snake's body is now from (8,6) extending to (8,5) and (9,5) if I've grown. Wait, actually, when I moved from (8,5) to (8,6), my body would follow, so my body segments would be at (8,6) as the head, (8,5), and (9,5). So I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nIf I decide to move towards (7,9), I need to go LEFT to (7,6), then UP to (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). Alternatively, moving towards (9,9), I can go RIGHT to (9,6), then UP to (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). Both paths are four steps, but I need to check if moving in any direction would cause me to collide with myself or another snake.\n\nMy current position is (8,6). If I move LEFT to (7,6), is that position clear? The board shows that (7,9) has an apple, but nothing about (7,6). So probably clear. Then moving UP each step from (7,6) to (7,9), which is an apple. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,6), which was my previous position, but now I've grown, so (9,5) is part of my body. Moving to (9,6) might be safe, but I need to check if it's occupied by enemy snakes or my body.\n\nWait, after moving from (9,5) to (8,5), and then to (8,6), my body would be (8,6) as head, followed by (8,5), then (9,5). So (9,5) is the tail. If I move to (9,6), that's a new square, so it's safe unless another snake is there, but from the last information, enemy snakes are at (1,3). So moving RIGHT to (9,6) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,6) is also safe because there's no apple there, and the enemy is far away.\n\nNow, I should consider which path might lead me to the apple while avoiding future collisions. If I go LEFT to (7,6), I can then move UP each step towards (7,9). Alternatively, going RIGHT to (9,6), then moving UP towards (9,9).\n\nBut wait, moving towards (9,9) would require me to go from (8,6) to (9,6), then (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). But (8,6) is my head, and (9,6) is next. Then each UP move would follow. However, I should check if moving into (9,6) is safe. Since my body is at (8,5) and (9,5), I don't think (9,6) is part of my body yet. So that's safe.\n\nOn the other hand, moving LEFT to (7,6) is also a clear path. I think either direction is viable. However, the path towards (9,9) might intercept with my body if I turn after that. Alternatively, moving towards (7,9) would take me away from my body.\n\nWait, another consideration: after I collect the apple, I should continue moving in a way that allows me to collect the next apple without running into myself. So perhaps moving towards (9,9) is better because it's closer in the X coordinate, but both are the same distance.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (7,9) because it's on the same X as another apple, but that might not matter immediately.\n\nI think I'll choose to move RIGHT to (9,6), then proceed UP towards (9,9). So my next move is RIGHT.\n\nWait, no, because I'm at (8,6), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,6). But I just moved from (8,6) to (9,6), and the next step is UP to (9,7), and so on. That should be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go LEFT to (7,6), then up to (7,9). Either path seems viable. Since both are equal, I can choose either. Let's pick moving towards (7,9) first because maybe that leads to less obstruction, but actually, it's the same.\n\nAlternatively, considering that moving RIGHT towards (9,9) might be more direct because it's a straight line, whereas moving LEFT and then UP might take the same number of steps. Since both are equal, I can choose either. I think I'll move LEFT first towards (7,9).\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. I'm at (8,6). To get to (7,9), I need to move LEFT to (7,6), then UP three steps to (7,9). To get to (9,9), I move RIGHT to (9,6), then UP three steps. Both require the same number of moves, 4 steps.\n\nBut considering the positions, moving towards (7,9) would take me into a less populated area, perhaps, while (9,9) is a corner. But since both are clear, it's a toss-up. I'll choose to move towards (9,9) as it's in the upper right, which might give me more space.\n\nTherefore, my next move is RIGHT to (9,6), then I can proceed UP towards (9,9).\n\nWait, but if I move RIGHT now, I'll be at (9,6). From there, next move will be UP to (9,7), then (9,8), then (9,9). So that's the plan.\n\nAlternatively, I could move LEFT to (7,6), then UP to (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), which also gets me to an apple.\n\nI think I'll go for (9,9) because it's in the corner, and less likely for the enemy snake to approach from there, but since the enemy is at (1,3), it's probably irrelevant.\n\nSo, I'll move RIGHT to (9,6) next.\n\nWait, but wait, I just realized that moving RIGHT to (9,6) would mean that my snake's body would now be at (8,6), (8,5), (9,5). So moving RIGHT to (9,6) is safe because that's a new square not occupied by my body yet.\n\nYes, so I think moving RIGHT is the way to go.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT\n\n**Rationale:** Moving RIGHT towards (9,6) starts the path to collect the apple at (9,9), which is safely accessible without immediate threats. This move avoids collision with my own body and enemy snakes, allowing for growth and point accumulation."

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me try to visualize the board first based on the information given.\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake, which is snake ID 2, is currently at position (9,5). So that's the far right column, somewhere in the middle vertically. My goal is to collect apples to grow and gain points without dying.\n\nLooking at the apples, they are at these positions: (8,6), (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2). So I have five apples on the board. My snake is at (9,5), so I need to see which direction to go next to reach an apple without causing any collisions.\n\nEnemy snakes: Snake #1 is at (1,3), with an empty body list. So snake #1 is at (1,3), which is on the left side near the bottom. I need to make sure my path doesn't cross snake #1, or I'll die.\n\nFirst, I should think about potential directions. From (9,5), possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. But wait, moving RIGHT isn't possible because x=9 is the maximum x-coordinate, so moving right would take me to x=10, which is outside the board\u2014so that's a wall. So moving right would cause me to run into a wall and die. So I can eliminate RIGHT as an option.\n\nNext, let's consider moving LEFT, which would decrease the x-coordinate. If I move left, my next position would be (8,5). Is that a good move? Let me check if there's an apple there. Looking at the apples: (8,6) is an apple. So (8,5) is one below that. If I go to (8,5), am I safe? There's no immediate threat there. But my goal is to get to an apple, so moving to (8,5) would put me one step closer to the apple at (8,6). Then, next turn, I could move UP to (8,6) to collect the apple. That seems promising.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about moving UP or DOWN from (9,5). Moving UP would take me to (9,6). Is there an apple nearby? The apple at (8,6) is to the left of (9,6), so it's adjacent. But snake #1 is far away at (1,3), so maybe that's not a direct threat. However, to reach that apple from (9,6), I'd have to move left to (8,6). But I'm not sure if that's better than moving left first.\n\nIf I move DOWN from (9,5) to (9,4), is there an apple nearby? Looking at the apples, there's one at (7,9) and (4,9), which are at higher y-coordinates, so moving down would take me away from them. Also, (1,2) is far away, so it's not helpful to go down towards y=2 when I'm at y=5.\n\nWait, another thought: after moving left to (8,5), the next move up would get me the apple. That seems like a solid plan because it's a direct path with two moves, and there's no obstruction in between. Also, moving left from (9,5) to (8,5) doesn't put me in any immediate danger, as snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away.\n\nAnother consideration: The wall at x=9 is on the right, but moving left is safe as x=8 is within the board. Are there any other snakes near (8,5)? The only enemy is at (1,3), so no conflict there.\n\nLooking at the apples again, the ones at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9) are all at y=9, which is the top row. That's pretty far from my current position. The apple at (1,2) is on the left side, lower part. The closest apple to me is (8,6), which is to the left one and up one from my current position. So it's two moves away: left then up.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up first to (9,6), then left to (8,6) to get the apple. So that's two moves as well. Either way, it's two steps. But which path is safer?\n\nLet me consider the direction of each move. If I go left first, from (9,5) to (8,5), then up to (8,6). Alternatively, if I go up first to (9,6), then left to (8,6). Either way, both require two moves.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer one over the other? Let me check the surrounding areas. Moving left first might be better because when I'm at (9,6), I'm one step away from the wall on the top, so moving down from there is still possible. But if I go up first, I don't think it matters because I can still move down or left.\n\nWait, another thought: when I move left to (8,5), my next move would be to go up to (8,6) to collect the apple. After that, I would have grown, so my snake's body would be from (9,5) to (8,5) to (8,6). But the initial move from (9,5) to (8,5) is just the head moving, so my body would follow. Wait, no, in this game, every move the head moves, and the body follows, but since I'm starting with just the head at (9,5), moving left would put my head at (8,5), and the body isn't there yet, so I don't have to worry about running into myself yet.\n\nWait, actually, according to the rules, if I run into myself, I die. Since I'm just the head at (9,5), and I move to (8,5), my body isn't present elsewhere, so that's safe. So the path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving up first to (9,6) is also possible, but then I can move left to (8,6) to get the apple. Either way, it's two moves, but perhaps moving left first is more efficient because then I'm moving towards the center, which might give more flexibility for future moves.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move left first, I'm getting closer to the apple at (8,6), which is the closest one. If I move up first, I'm moving towards the top, but the apples are at y=9, which is a bit further. So perhaps moving left is better because it gets me closer to an apple in two moves.\n\nWait, but moving up first would get me to (9,6), which is adjacent to (8,6), so that's also a good move.\n\nI'm not sure which one is better. Either way, I can get to (8,6) in two moves. But perhaps moving left first is better because it's a more direct approach to the apple without getting too high on the board, which might have more walls nearby.\n\nLet me also think about the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (1,3). That's on the left side, but far from my current position. If I start moving left towards (8,5) and then up, I don't think snake #1 will interfere because it's too far away.\n\nAnother consideration: after collecting the apple at (8,6), where should I go next? There's another apple at (7,9), which is further left and up. Maybe I can plan a path after that, but perhaps I should focus on one apple at a time.\n\nSo, weighing the options:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (8,5) is a safe move, no immediate threats, and brings me closer to the apple at (8,6).\n\n- Moving UP to (9,6) is also safe, but I'm at the edge of the board, so I have to be careful about the wall at x=9 if I go further.\n\nI think moving LEFT is the better option because it moves me away from the right wall and towards the center, which gives me more flexibility for future moves. Plus, moving left first gets me closer to the apple in two moves.\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT. Then, in the following move, I can go UP to collect the apple. That makes sense.\n\nI should also check if there are any other possible threats or apples nearby, but it doesn't seem so. The other apples are farther away, and snake #1 is too far to pose an immediate threat.\n\nAnother thought: after I move LEFT to (8,5), will there be any possibility of collision with my own body?

Enemy snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away, so I don't need to worry about it right now.\n\nFrom (8,5), I can move in four directions: UP to (8,6), DOWN to (8,4), LEFT to (7,5), or RIGHT back to (9,5).

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm in control of snake ID 2, currently positioned at (8,6). I just collected an apple at (8,6), which means I've grown and now have that point. My last move was UP to get to this position. Now, I need to think about the next move carefully.\n\nFirst, let me update the board state in my mind. The apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and the one I just ate at (8,6). So now, the nearest apple to me is at (7,9). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and (9,9). I'm at (8,6), so perhaps I should check the positions again.\n\nWait, the apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and (9,9). So the closest one to me at (8,6) is actually the one at (9,9), which is to the right and up. Alternatively, there's also one at (7,9) which is to the left and up. Let me check the distances.\n\nDistance to (7,9): From (8,6) to (7,9). X difference is 1, Y difference is 3. Total steps: 4 moves.\n\nDistance to (9,9): From (8,6) to (9,9). X difference is 1, Y difference is 3. Also 4 moves.\n\nDistance to (4,9): That's further away, (8,6) to (4,9). X difference is 4, Y difference is 3. 7 moves.\n\nDistance to (3,9): Even further.\n\nDistance to (1,2): From (8,6) to (1,2) is X difference 7, Y difference 4. 11 moves, which is way too far.\n\nSo the closest apples are at (7,9) and (9,9), both 4 steps away. Now, I need to decide which path is safer and more direct.\n\nLooking at enemy snakes, snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away from me. So I don't have to worry about it for now. My snake's body is now from (8,6) extending to (8,5) and (9,5) if I've grown. Wait, actually, when I moved from (8,5) to (8,6), my body would follow, so my body segments would be at (8,6) as the head, (8,5), and (9,5). So I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nIf I decide to move towards (7,9), I need to go LEFT to (7,6), then UP to (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). Alternatively, moving towards (9,9), I can go RIGHT to (9,6), then UP to (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). Both paths are four steps, but I need to check if moving in any direction would cause me to collide with myself or another snake.\n\nMy current position is (8,6). If I move LEFT to (7,6), is that position clear? The board shows that (7,9) has an apple, but nothing about (7,6). So probably clear. Then moving UP each step from (7,6) to (7,9), which is an apple. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,6), which was my previous position, but now I've grown, so (9,5) is part of my body. Moving to (9,6) might be safe, but I need to check if it's occupied by enemy snakes or my body.\n\nWait, after moving from (9,5) to (8,5), and then to (8,6), my body would be (8,6) as head, followed by (8,5), then (9,5). So (9,5) is the tail. If I move to (9,6), that's a new square, so it's safe unless another snake is there, but from the last information, enemy snakes are at (1,3). So moving RIGHT to (9,6) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,6) is also safe because there's no apple there, and the enemy is far away.\n\nNow, I should consider which path might lead me to the apple while avoiding future collisions. If I go LEFT to (7,6), I can then move UP each step towards (7,9). Alternatively, going RIGHT to (9,6), then moving UP towards (9,9).\n\nBut wait, moving towards (9,9) would require me to go from (8,6) to (9,6), then (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). But (8,6) is my head, and (9,6) is next. Then each UP move would follow. However, I should check if moving into (9,6) is safe. Since my body is at (8,5) and (9,5), I don't think (9,6) is part of my body yet. So that's safe.\n\nOn the other hand, moving LEFT to (7,6) is also a clear path. I think either direction is viable. However, the path towards (9,9) might intercept with my body if I turn after that. Alternatively, moving towards (7,9) would take me away from my body.\n\nWait, another consideration: after I collect the apple, I should continue moving in a way that allows me to collect the next apple without running into myself. So perhaps moving towards (9,9) is better because it's closer in the X coordinate, but both are the same distance.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (7,9) because it's on the same X as another apple, but that might not matter immediately.\n\nI think I'll choose to move RIGHT to (9,6), then proceed UP towards (9,9). So my next move is RIGHT.\n\nWait, no, because I'm at (8,6), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,6). But I just moved from (8,6) to (9,6), and the next step is UP to (9,7), and so on. That should be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go LEFT to (7,6), then up to (7,9). Either path seems viable. Since both are equal, I can choose either. Let's pick moving towards (7,9) first because maybe that leads to less obstruction, but actually, it's the same.\n\nAlternatively, considering that moving RIGHT towards (9,9) might be more direct because it's a straight line, whereas moving LEFT and then UP might take the same number of steps. Since both are equal, I can choose either. I think I'll move LEFT first towards (7,9).\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. I'm at (8,6). To get to (7,9), I need to move LEFT to (7,6), then UP three steps to (7,9). To get to (9,9), I move RIGHT to (9,6), then UP three steps. Both require the same number of moves, 4 steps.\n\nBut considering the positions, moving towards (7,9) would take me into a less populated area, perhaps, while (9,9) is a corner. But since both are clear, it's a toss-up. I'll choose to move towards (9,9) as it's in the upper right, which might give me more space.\n\nTherefore, my next move is RIGHT to (9,6), then I can proceed UP towards (9,9).\n\nWait, but if I move RIGHT now, I'll be at (9,6). From there, next move will be UP to (9,7), then (9,8), then (9,9). So that's the plan.\n\nAlternatively, I could move LEFT to (7,6), then UP to (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), which also gets me to an apple.\n\nI think I'll go for (9,9) because it's in the corner, and less likely for the enemy snake to approach from there, but since the enemy is at (1,3), it's probably irrelevant.\n\nSo, I'll move RIGHT to (9,6) next.\n\nWait, but wait, I just realized that moving RIGHT to (9,6) would mean that my snake's body would now be at (8,6), (8,5), (9,5). So moving RIGHT to (9,6) is safe because that's a new square not occupied by my body yet.\n\nYes, so I think moving RIGHT is the way to go.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT\n\n**Rationale:** Moving RIGHT towards (9,6) starts the path to collect the apple at (9,9), which is safely accessible without immediate threats. This move avoids collision with my own body and enemy snakes, allowing for growth and point accumulation."

So (8,9) doesn't have an apple, but it might be a good path to get to one.\n\nLooking at the other apples: (7,9) is just left of me. So if I move left to (8,9), then next turn I can move to (7,9) to eat that apple. That seems like a solid plan.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,8) would take me back to where I was, but since that's my body, I can't go there because I would run into myself and die. So moving down is not an option.\n\nWait, no, the snake can sometimes move over its own body if it's growing, but I'm not sure about the rules here. Rule 3 says you die if you run into yourself. So moving down would take me into (9,8), which is my previous position, so that's part of my body now. So moving down would make me die. So I can't go down.\n\nSo my only option is to move left to (8,9). That way, I can approach the apple at (7,9). Also, I need to check if there are any enemy snakes nearby. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,7). That's quite far from me right now, so I don't have to worry about it immediately.\n\nSo the plan is to move left to (8,9) now. Next turn, I can move left again to (7,9) to eat that apple. Then, I'll have another point and keep growing. I should also look ahead to see if there are other nearby apples I can reach after eating (7,9). The next closest is (4,9), but that's further left. But since I'm moving left, I might as well go for that as well.\n\nI also need to make sure that when I move left, I don't run into any walls or other obstacles. Since (8,9) is within the board, it's safe. There are no enemy snakes or other parts of my body in that spot, as far as I can tell.\n\nWait, let me double-check the board state. The board shows that at y=9, the positions are: 9 has me (snake 2), 7 has an apple, 4 and 3 have apples too. So moving left to (8,9) is clear. Also, I don't see any enemy snakes near the top row.\n\nSo, conclusion: move LEFT to (8,9) to approach the apple at (7,9).\n</think>\n\nI need to move left to (8,9) to position myself towards the next apple at (7,9). Moving down or right would either cause me to collide with myself or go out of bounds.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me try to visualize the board first based on the information given.\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake, which is snake ID 2, is currently at position (9,5). So that's the far right column, somewhere in the middle vertically. My goal is to collect apples to grow and gain points without dying.\n\nLooking at the apples, they are at these positions: (8,6), (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2). So I have five apples on the board. My snake is at (9,5), so I need to see which direction to go next to reach an apple without causing any collisions.\n\nEnemy snakes: Snake #1 is at (1,3), with an empty body list. So snake #1 is at (1,3), which is on the left side near the bottom. I need to make sure my path doesn't cross snake #1, or I'll die.\n\nFirst, I should think about potential directions. From (9,5), possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. But wait, moving RIGHT isn't possible because x=9 is the maximum x-coordinate, so moving right would take me to x=10, which is outside the board\u2014so that's a wall. So moving right would cause me to run into a wall and die. So I can eliminate RIGHT as an option.\n\nNext, let's consider moving LEFT, which would decrease the x-coordinate. If I move left, my next position would be (8,5). Is that a good move? Let me check if there's an apple there. Looking at the apples: (8,6) is an apple. So (8,5) is one below that. If I go to (8,5), am I safe? There's no immediate threat there. But my goal is to get to an apple, so moving to (8,5) would put me one step closer to the apple at (8,6). Then, next turn, I could move UP to (8,6) to collect the apple. That seems promising.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about moving UP or DOWN from (9,5). Moving UP would take me to (9,6). Is there an apple nearby? The apple at (8,6) is to the left of (9,6), so it's adjacent. But snake #1 is far away at (1,3), so maybe that's not a direct threat. However, to reach that apple from (9,6), I'd have to move left to (8,6). But I'm not sure if that's better than moving left first.\n\nIf I move DOWN from (9,5) to (9,4), is there an apple nearby? Looking at the apples, there's one at (7,9) and (4,9), which are at higher y-coordinates, so moving down would take me away from them. Also, (1,2) is far away, so it's not helpful to go down towards y=2 when I'm at y=5.\n\nWait, another thought: after moving left to (8,5), the next move up would get me the apple. That seems like a solid plan because it's a direct path with two moves, and there's no obstruction in between. Also, moving left from (9,5) to (8,5) doesn't put me in any immediate danger, as snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away.\n\nAnother consideration: The wall at x=9 is on the right, but moving left is safe as x=8 is within the board. Are there any other snakes near (8,5)? The only enemy is at (1,3), so no conflict there.\n\nLooking at the apples again, the ones at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9) are all at y=9, which is the top row. That's pretty far from my current position. The apple at (1,2) is on the left side, lower part. The closest apple to me is (8,6), which is to the left one and up one from my current position. So it's two moves away: left then up.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up first to (9,6), then left to (8,6) to get the apple. So that's two moves as well. Either way, it's two steps. But which path is safer?\n\nLet me consider the direction of each move. If I go left first, from (9,5) to (8,5), then up to (8,6). Alternatively, if I go up first to (9,6), then left to (8,6). Either way, both require two moves.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer one over the other? Let me check the surrounding areas. Moving left first might be better because when I'm at (9,6), I'm one step away from the wall on the top, so moving down from there is still possible. But if I go up first, I don't think it matters because I can still move down or left.\n\nWait, another thought: when I move left to (8,5), my next move would be to go up to (8,6) to collect the apple. After that, I would have grown, so my snake's body would be from (9,5) to (8,5) to (8,6). But the initial move from (9,5) to (8,5) is just the head moving, so my body would follow. Wait, no, in this game, every move the head moves, and the body follows, but since I'm starting with just the head at (9,5), moving left would put my head at (8,5), and the body isn't there yet, so I don't have to worry about running into myself yet.\n\nWait, actually, according to the rules, if I run into myself, I die. Since I'm just the head at (9,5), and I move to (8,5), my body isn't present elsewhere, so that's safe. So the path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving up first to (9,6) is also possible, but then I can move left to (8,6) to get the apple. Either way, it's two moves, but perhaps moving left first is more efficient because then I'm moving towards the center, which might give more flexibility for future moves.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move left first, I'm getting closer to the apple at (8,6), which is the closest one. If I move up first, I'm moving towards the top, but the apples are at y=9, which is a bit further. So perhaps moving left is better because it gets me closer to an apple in two moves.\n\nWait, but moving up first would get me to (9,6), which is adjacent to (8,6), so that's also a good move.\n\nI'm not sure which one is better. Either way, I can get to (8,6) in two moves. But perhaps moving left first is better because it's a more direct approach to the apple without getting too high on the board, which might have more walls nearby.\n\nLet me also think about the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (1,3). That's on the left side, but far from my current position. If I start moving left towards (8,5) and then up, I don't think snake #1 will interfere because it's too far away.\n\nAnother consideration: after collecting the apple at (8,6), where should I go next? There's another apple at (7,9), which is further left and up. Maybe I can plan a path after that, but perhaps I should focus on one apple at a time.\n\nSo, weighing the options:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (8,5) is a safe move, no immediate threats, and brings me closer to the apple at (8,6).\n\n- Moving UP to (9,6) is also safe, but I'm at the edge of the board, so I have to be careful about the wall at x=9 if I go further.\n\nI think moving LEFT is the better option because it moves me away from the right wall and towards the center, which gives me more flexibility for future moves. Plus, moving left first gets me closer to the apple in two moves.\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT. Then, in the following move, I can go UP to collect the apple. That makes sense.\n\nI should also check if there are any other possible threats or apples nearby, but it doesn't seem so. The other apples are farther away, and snake #1 is too far to pose an immediate threat.\n\nAnother thought: after I move LEFT to (8,5), will there be any possibility of collision with my own body? Since I'm just moving the head, and my body doesn't extend beyond that yet, I don't think so. So it's safe.\n\nAlright, I think I'll go with moving LEFT to (8,5) next. That's my next move.\n</think>\n\nMy next move is LEFT to position (8,5), moving towards the apple at (8,6). This brings me closer to the nearest apple without immediate threats and opens up more options for future moves.\n\nLEFT"

Let me recap the situation.\n\nApples are at: (8,6), (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2). So the closest apple is right above me at (8,6). Enemy snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away, so I don't need to worry about it right now.\n\nFrom (8,5), I can move in four directions: UP to (8,6), DOWN to (8,4), LEFT to (7,5), or RIGHT back to (9,5). Since I just moved from (9,5) to (8,5), moving RIGHT back isn't helpful unless I'm trying to avoid something, which I'm not. So RIGHT is out.\n\nMoving DOWN to (8,4) takes me away from the apple, which is at (8,6). So that doesn't help. Moving LEFT to (7,5) also moves me away from the nearby apple. Therefore, the best move is UP to (8,6), which is exactly where the apple is. Moving UP will let me collect the apple, grow, and gain a point.\n\nI should also consider if moving UP poses any immediate threats. The wall is at y=9, so (8,6) is within bounds. No enemy snakes are nearby, so moving UP is safe.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (8,6), my snake will grow by one segment, so I need to be cautious about my body's position in future moves to avoid self-collision. But for now, the move is straightforward.\n\nSo, the next move should be UP to (8,6) to collect the apple. That's the logical step to take.\n</think>\n\nUP\n\n**Rationale:** Moving UP to (8,6) allows me to collect the apple, gain a point, and grow. This move is safe as there are no immediate threats."

            "move": "RIGHT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm in control of snake ID 2, currently positioned at (8,6). I just collected an apple at (8,6), which means I've grown and now have that point. My last move was UP to get to this position. Now, I need to think about the next move carefully.\n\nFirst, let me update the board state in my mind. The apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and the one I just ate at (8,6). So now, the nearest apple to me is at (7,9). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and (9,9). I'm at (8,6), so perhaps I should check the positions again.\n\nWait, the apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and (9,9). So the closest one to me at (8,6) is actually the one at (9,9), which is to the right and up. Alternatively, there's also one at (7,9) which is to the left and up. Let me check the distances.\n\nDistance to (7,9): From (8,6) to (7,9). X difference is 1, Y difference is 3. Total steps: 4 moves.\n\nDistance to (9,9): From (8,6) to (9,9). X difference is 1, Y difference is 3. Also 4 moves.\n\nDistance to (4,9): That's further away, (8,6) to (4,9). X difference is 4, Y difference is 3. 7 moves.\n\nDistance to (3,9): Even further.\n\nDistance to (1,2): From (8,6) to (1,2) is X difference 7, Y difference 4. 11 moves, which is way too far.\n\nSo the closest apples are at (7,9) and (9,9), both 4 steps away. Now, I need to decide which path is safer and more direct.\n\nLooking at enemy snakes, snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away from me. So I don't have to worry about it for now. My snake's body is now from (8,6) extending to (8,5) and (9,5) if I've grown. Wait, actually, when I moved from (8,5) to (8,6), my body would follow, so my body segments would be at (8,6) as the head, (8,5), and (9,5). So I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nIf I decide to move towards (7,9), I need to go LEFT to (7,6), then UP to (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). Alternatively, moving towards (9,9), I can go RIGHT to (9,6), then UP to (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). Both paths are four steps, but I need to check if moving in any direction would cause me to collide with myself or another snake.\n\nMy current position is (8,6). If I move LEFT to (7,6), is that position clear? The board shows that (7,9) has an apple, but nothing about (7,6). So probably clear. Then moving UP each step from (7,6) to (7,9), which is an apple. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,6), which was my previous position, but now I've grown, so (9,5) is part of my body. Moving to (9,6) might be safe, but I need to check if it's occupied by enemy snakes or my body.\n\nWait, after moving from (9,5) to (8,5), and then to (8,6), my body would be (8,6) as head, followed by (8,5), then (9,5). So (9,5) is the tail. If I move to (9,6), that's a new square, so it's safe unless another snake is there, but from the last information, enemy snakes are at (1,3). So moving RIGHT to (9,6) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,6) is also safe because there's no apple there, and the enemy is far away.\n\nNow, I should consider which path might lead me to the apple while avoiding future collisions. If I go LEFT to (7,6), I can then move UP each step towards (7,9). Alternatively, going RIGHT to (9,6), then moving UP towards (9,9).\n\nBut wait, moving towards (9,9) would require me to go from (8,6) to (9,6), then (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). But (8,6) is my head, and (9,6) is next. Then each UP move would follow. However, I should check if moving into (9,6) is safe. Since my body is at (8,5) and (9,5), I don't think (9,6) is part of my body yet. So that's safe.\n\nOn the other hand, moving LEFT to (7,6) is also a clear path. I think either direction is viable. However, the path towards (9,9) might intercept with my body if I turn after that. Alternatively, moving towards (7,9) would take me away from my body.\n\nWait, another consideration: after I collect the apple, I should continue moving in a way that allows me to collect the next apple without running into myself. So perhaps moving towards (9,9) is better because it's closer in the X coordinate, but both are the same distance.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (7,9) because it's on the same X as another apple, but that might not matter immediately.\n\nI think I'll choose to move RIGHT to (9,6), then proceed UP towards (9,9). So my next move is RIGHT.\n\nWait, no, because I'm at (8,6), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,6). But I just moved from (8,6) to (9,6), and the next step is UP to (9,7), and so on. That should be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go LEFT to (7,6), then up to (7,9). Either path seems viable. Since both are equal, I can choose either. Let's pick moving towards (7,9) first because maybe that leads to less obstruction, but actually, it's the same.\n\nAlternatively, considering that moving RIGHT towards (9,9) might be more direct because it's a straight line, whereas moving LEFT and then UP might take the same number of steps. Since both are equal, I can choose either. I think I'll move LEFT first towards (7,9).\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. I'm at (8,6). To get to (7,9), I need to move LEFT to (7,6), then UP three steps to (7,9). To get to (9,9), I move RIGHT to (9,6), then UP three steps. Both require the same number of moves, 4 steps.\n\nBut considering the positions, moving towards (7,9) would take me into a less populated area, perhaps, while (9,9) is a corner. But since both are clear, it's a toss-up. I'll choose to move towards (9,9) as it's in the upper right, which might give me more space.\n\nTherefore, my next move is RIGHT to (9,6), then I can proceed UP towards (9,9).\n\nWait, but if I move RIGHT now, I'll be at (9,6).

So moving RIGHT to (9,6) is safe because that's a new square not occupied by my body yet.\n\nYes, so I think moving RIGHT is the way to go.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT\n\n**Rationale:** Moving RIGHT towards (9,6) starts the path to collect the apple at (9,9), which is safely accessible without immediate threats. This move avoids collision with my own body and enemy snakes, allowing for growth and point accumulation."

It doesn\u2019t contribute directly to reaching any apples.\n   - RIGHT to (2, 6) also doesn\u2019t lead to an apple immediately, but it does keep options open for future movements in that row for potential apples below.\n\n2. **Focus on Apples**:\n   - My target remains the apple at (1, 2). However, currently, I need to maintain a strategy that doesn\u2019t box me in.

From the last move, I was moving up, so I must have come from (9,8) to (9,9). Now, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the board, there are apples at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), (6,5). My snake is already at (9,9), which is an apple location. So I just ate that apple, right? That means I grew and gained a point. Cool, but now I need to go after another apple.\n\nSince I'm at (9,9), the highest point on the board, I can't go up anymore because that's the edge. So my options are down, right, or left. Wait, right from (9,9) would take me outside the board because x can't be 10. So right is out. So I have to choose between left or down.\n\nIf I go left from (9,9), I move to (8,9). Let me check if that's safe. The board shows that at y=9, the positions are: x=0 to 9, but the apples are at x=7,4,3. So at (8,9), is there an apple? Wait, the apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9). So (8,9) doesn't have an apple, but it might be a good path to get to one.\n\nLooking at the other apples: (7,9) is just left of me. So if I move left to (8,9), then next turn I can move to (7,9) to eat that apple. That seems like a solid plan.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,8) would take me back to where I was, but since that's my body, I can't go there because I would run into myself and die. So moving down is not an option.\n\nWait, no, the snake can sometimes move over its own body if it's growing, but I'm not sure about the rules here. Rule 3 says you die if you run into yourself. So moving down would take me into (9,8), which is my previous position, so that's part of my body now. So moving down would make me die. So I can't go down.\n\nSo my only option is to move left to (8,9). That way, I can approach the apple at (7,9). Also, I need to check if there are any enemy snakes nearby. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,7). That's quite far from me right now, so I don't have to worry about it immediately.\n\nSo the plan is to move left to (8,9) now. Next turn, I can move left again to (7,9) to eat that apple. Then, I'll have another point and keep growing. I should also look ahead to see if there are other nearby apples I can reach after eating (7,9). The next closest is (4,9), but that's further left. But since I'm moving left, I might as well go for that as well.\n\nI also need to make sure that when I move left, I don't run into any walls or other obstacles. Since (8,9) is within the board, it's safe. There are no enemy snakes or other parts of my body in that spot, as far as I can tell.\n\nWait, let me double-check the board state. The board shows that at y=9, the positions are: 9 has me (snake 2), 7 has an apple, 4 and 3 have apples too. So moving left to (8,9) is clear. Also, I don't see any enemy snakes near the top row.\n\nSo, conclusion: move LEFT to (8,9) to approach the apple at (7,9).\n</think>\n\nI need to move left to (8,9) to position myself towards the next apple at (7,9).

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm playing this Snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let me try to visualize the board first based on the information given.\n\nThe board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake, which is snake ID 2, is currently at position (9,5). So that's the far right column, somewhere in the middle vertically. My goal is to collect apples to grow and gain points without dying.\n\nLooking at the apples, they are at these positions: (8,6), (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2). So I have five apples on the board. My snake is at (9,5), so I need to see which direction to go next to reach an apple without causing any collisions.\n\nEnemy snakes: Snake #1 is at (1,3), with an empty body list. So snake #1 is at (1,3), which is on the left side near the bottom. I need to make sure my path doesn't cross snake #1, or I'll die.\n\nFirst, I should think about potential directions. From (9,5), possible directions are UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT. But wait, moving RIGHT isn't possible because x=9 is the maximum x-coordinate, so moving right would take me to x=10, which is outside the board\u2014so that's a wall. So moving right would cause me to run into a wall and die. So I can eliminate RIGHT as an option.\n\nNext, let's consider moving LEFT, which would decrease the x-coordinate. If I move left, my next position would be (8,5). Is that a good move? Let me check if there's an apple there. Looking at the apples: (8,6) is an apple. So (8,5) is one below that. If I go to (8,5), am I safe? There's no immediate threat there. But my goal is to get to an apple, so moving to (8,5) would put me one step closer to the apple at (8,6). Then, next turn, I could move UP to (8,6) to collect the apple. That seems promising.\n\nAlternatively, I could think about moving UP or DOWN from (9,5). Moving UP would take me to (9,6). Is there an apple nearby? The apple at (8,6) is to the left of (9,6), so it's adjacent. But snake #1 is far away at (1,3), so maybe that's not a direct threat. However, to reach that apple from (9,6), I'd have to move left to (8,6). But I'm not sure if that's better than moving left first.\n\nIf I move DOWN from (9,5) to (9,4), is there an apple nearby? Looking at the apples, there's one at (7,9) and (4,9), which are at higher y-coordinates, so moving down would take me away from them. Also, (1,2) is far away, so it's not helpful to go down towards y=2 when I'm at y=5.\n\nWait, another thought: after moving left to (8,5), the next move up would get me the apple. That seems like a solid plan because it's a direct path with two moves, and there's no obstruction in between. Also, moving left from (9,5) to (8,5) doesn't put me in any immediate danger, as snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away.\n\nAnother consideration: The wall at x=9 is on the right, but moving left is safe as x=8 is within the board. Are there any other snakes near (8,5)? The only enemy is at (1,3), so no conflict there.\n\nLooking at the apples again, the ones at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9) are all at y=9, which is the top row. That's pretty far from my current position. The apple at (1,2) is on the left side, lower part. The closest apple to me is (8,6), which is to the left one and up one from my current position. So it's two moves away: left then up.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up first to (9,6), then left to (8,6) to get the apple. So that's two moves as well. Either way, it's two steps. But which path is safer?\n\nLet me consider the direction of each move. If I go left first, from (9,5) to (8,5), then up to (8,6). Alternatively, if I go up first to (9,6), then left to (8,6). Either way, both require two moves.\n\nIs there any reason to prefer one over the other? Let me check the surrounding areas. Moving left first might be better because when I'm at (9,6), I'm one step away from the wall on the top, so moving down from there is still possible. But if I go up first, I don't think it matters because I can still move down or left.\n\nWait, another thought: when I move left to (8,5), my next move would be to go up to (8,6) to collect the apple. After that, I would have grown, so my snake's body would be from (9,5) to (8,5) to (8,6). But the initial move from (9,5) to (8,5) is just the head moving, so my body would follow. Wait, no, in this game, every move the head moves, and the body follows, but since I'm starting with just the head at (9,5), moving left would put my head at (8,5), and the body isn't there yet, so I don't have to worry about running into myself yet.\n\nWait, actually, according to the rules, if I run into myself, I die. Since I'm just the head at (9,5), and I move to (8,5), my body isn't present elsewhere, so that's safe. So the path seems clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving up first to (9,6) is also possible, but then I can move left to (8,6) to get the apple. Either way, it's two moves, but perhaps moving left first is more efficient because then I'm moving towards the center, which might give more flexibility for future moves.\n\nAnother consideration: if I move left first, I'm getting closer to the apple at (8,6), which is the closest one. If I move up first, I'm moving towards the top, but the apples are at y=9, which is a bit further. So perhaps moving left is better because it gets me closer to an apple in two moves.\n\nWait, but moving up first would get me to (9,6), which is adjacent to (8,6), so that's also a good move.\n\nI'm not sure which one is better. Either way, I can get to (8,6) in two moves. But perhaps moving left first is better because it's a more direct approach to the apple without getting too high on the board, which might have more walls nearby.\n\nLet me also think about the enemy snake. Snake #1 is at (1,3). That's on the left side, but far from my current position. If I start moving left towards (8,5) and then up, I don't think snake #1 will interfere because it's too far away.\n\nAnother consideration: after collecting the apple at (8,6), where should I go next? There's another apple at (7,9), which is further left and up. Maybe I can plan a path after that, but perhaps I should focus on one apple at a time.\n\nSo, weighing the options:\n\n- Moving LEFT to (8,5) is a safe move, no immediate threats, and brings me closer to the apple at (8,6).\n\n- Moving UP to (9,6) is also safe, but I'm at the edge of the board, so I have to be careful about the wall at x=9 if I go further.\n\nI think moving LEFT is the better option because it moves me away from the right wall and towards the center, which gives me more flexibility for future moves. Plus, moving left first gets me closer to the apple in two moves.\n\nSo, my next move should be LEFT. Then, in the following move, I can go UP to collect the apple. That makes sense.\n\nI should also check if there are any other possible threats or apples nearby, but it doesn't seem so. The other apples are farther away, and snake #1 is too far to pose an immediate threat.\n\nAnother thought: after I move LEFT to (8,5), will there be any possibility of collision with my own body? Since I'm just moving the head, and my body doesn't extend beyond that yet, I don't think so. So it's safe.\n\nAlright, I think I'll go with moving LEFT to (8,5) next. That's my next move.\n</think>\n\nMy next move is LEFT to position (8,5), moving towards the apple at (8,6). This brings me closer to the nearest apple without immediate threats and opens up more options for future moves.\n\nLEFT"

Enemy snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away, so I don't need to worry about it right now.\n\nFrom (8,5), I can move in four directions: UP to (8,6), DOWN to (8,4), LEFT to (7,5), or RIGHT back to (9,5).

            "rationale": "<think>\nAlright, so I'm in control of snake ID 2, currently positioned at (8,6). I just collected an apple at (8,6), which means I've grown and now have that point. My last move was UP to get to this position. Now, I need to think about the next move carefully.\n\nFirst, let me update the board state in my mind. The apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and the one I just ate at (8,6). So now, the nearest apple to me is at (7,9). Wait, no, actually, looking back, the apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and (9,9). I'm at (8,6), so perhaps I should check the positions again.\n\nWait, the apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), and (9,9). So the closest one to me at (8,6) is actually the one at (9,9), which is to the right and up. Alternatively, there's also one at (7,9) which is to the left and up. Let me check the distances.\n\nDistance to (7,9): From (8,6) to (7,9). X difference is 1, Y difference is 3. Total steps: 4 moves.\n\nDistance to (9,9): From (8,6) to (9,9). X difference is 1, Y difference is 3. Also 4 moves.\n\nDistance to (4,9): That's further away, (8,6) to (4,9). X difference is 4, Y difference is 3. 7 moves.\n\nDistance to (3,9): Even further.\n\nDistance to (1,2): From (8,6) to (1,2) is X difference 7, Y difference 4. 11 moves, which is way too far.\n\nSo the closest apples are at (7,9) and (9,9), both 4 steps away. Now, I need to decide which path is safer and more direct.\n\nLooking at enemy snakes, snake #1 is at (1,3), which is far away from me. So I don't have to worry about it for now. My snake's body is now from (8,6) extending to (8,5) and (9,5) if I've grown. Wait, actually, when I moved from (8,5) to (8,6), my body would follow, so my body segments would be at (8,6) as the head, (8,5), and (9,5). So I need to be careful not to run into my own body.\n\nIf I decide to move towards (7,9), I need to go LEFT to (7,6), then UP to (7,7), (7,8), (7,9). Alternatively, moving towards (9,9), I can go RIGHT to (9,6), then UP to (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). Both paths are four steps, but I need to check if moving in any direction would cause me to collide with myself or another snake.\n\nMy current position is (8,6). If I move LEFT to (7,6), is that position clear? The board shows that (7,9) has an apple, but nothing about (7,6). So probably clear. Then moving UP each step from (7,6) to (7,9), which is an apple. Alternatively, moving RIGHT to (9,6), which was my previous position, but now I've grown, so (9,5) is part of my body. Moving to (9,6) might be safe, but I need to check if it's occupied by enemy snakes or my body.\n\nWait, after moving from (9,5) to (8,5), and then to (8,6), my body would be (8,6) as head, followed by (8,5), then (9,5). So (9,5) is the tail. If I move to (9,6), that's a new square, so it's safe unless another snake is there, but from the last information, enemy snakes are at (1,3). So moving RIGHT to (9,6) should be safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (7,6) is also safe because there's no apple there, and the enemy is far away.\n\nNow, I should consider which path might lead me to the apple while avoiding future collisions. If I go LEFT to (7,6), I can then move UP each step towards (7,9). Alternatively, going RIGHT to (9,6), then moving UP towards (9,9).\n\nBut wait, moving towards (9,9) would require me to go from (8,6) to (9,6), then (9,7), (9,8), (9,9). But (8,6) is my head, and (9,6) is next. Then each UP move would follow. However, I should check if moving into (9,6) is safe. Since my body is at (8,5) and (9,5), I don't think (9,6) is part of my body yet. So that's safe.\n\nOn the other hand, moving LEFT to (7,6) is also a clear path. I think either direction is viable. However, the path towards (9,9) might intercept with my body if I turn after that. Alternatively, moving towards (7,9) would take me away from my body.\n\nWait, another consideration: after I collect the apple, I should continue moving in a way that allows me to collect the next apple without running into myself. So perhaps moving towards (9,9) is better because it's closer in the X coordinate, but both are the same distance.\n\nAlternatively, I could consider moving towards (7,9) because it's on the same X as another apple, but that might not matter immediately.\n\nI think I'll choose to move RIGHT to (9,6), then proceed UP towards (9,9). So my next move is RIGHT.\n\nWait, no, because I'm at (8,6), moving RIGHT would take me to (9,6). But I just moved from (8,6) to (9,6), and the next step is UP to (9,7), and so on. That should be straightforward.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go LEFT to (7,6), then up to (7,9). Either path seems viable. Since both are equal, I can choose either. Let's pick moving towards (7,9) first because maybe that leads to less obstruction, but actually, it's the same.\n\nAlternatively, considering that moving RIGHT towards (9,9) might be more direct because it's a straight line, whereas moving LEFT and then UP might take the same number of steps. Since both are equal, I can choose either. I think I'll move LEFT first towards (7,9).\n\nWait, no, let me clarify. I'm at (8,6). To get to (7,9), I need to move LEFT to (7,6), then UP three steps to (7,9). To get to (9,9), I move RIGHT to (9,6), then UP three steps. Both require the same number of moves, 4 steps.\n\nBut considering the positions, moving towards (7,9) would take me into a less populated area, perhaps, while (9,9) is a corner. But since both are clear, it's a toss-up. I'll choose to move towards (9,9) as it's in the upper right, which might give me more space.\n\nTherefore, my next move is RIGHT to (9,6), then I can proceed UP towards (9,9).\n\nWait, but if I move RIGHT now, I'll be at (9,6). From there, next move will be UP to (9,7), then (9,8), then (9,9). So that's the plan.\n\nAlternatively, I could move LEFT to (7,6), then UP to (7,7), (7,8), (7,9), which also gets me to an apple.\n\nI think I'll go for (9,9) because it's in the corner, and less likely for the enemy snake to approach from there, but since the enemy is at (1,3), it's probably irrelevant.\n\nSo, I'll move RIGHT to (9,6) next.\n\nWait, but wait, I just realized that moving RIGHT to (9,6) would mean that my snake's body would now be at (8,6), (8,5), (9,5). So moving RIGHT to (9,6) is safe because that's a new square not occupied by my body yet.\n\nYes, so I think moving RIGHT is the way to go.\n</think>\n\nRIGHT\n\n**Rationale:** Moving RIGHT towards (9,6) starts the path to collect the apple at (9,9), which is safely accessible without immediate threats. This move avoids collision with my own body and enemy snakes, allowing for growth and point accumulation."

It keeps options open as I look toward possible future moves to navigate around and secure those apples.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the analysis, I decide to move **RIGHT to (3, 6)**.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me see... My snake is at (9,9), which is the top right corner of the board. From the last move, I was moving up, so I must have come from (9,8) to (9,9). Now, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the board, there are apples at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9), (1,2), (6,5). My snake is already at (9,9), which is an apple location. So I just ate that apple, right? That means I grew and gained a point. Cool, but now I need to go after another apple.\n\nSince I'm at (9,9), the highest point on the board, I can't go up anymore because that's the edge. So my options are down, right, or left. Wait, right from (9,9) would take me outside the board because x can't be 10. So right is out. So I have to choose between left or down.\n\nIf I go left from (9,9), I move to (8,9). Let me check if that's safe. The board shows that at y=9, the positions are: x=0 to 9, but the apples are at x=7,4,3. So at (8,9), is there an apple? Wait, the apples are at (7,9), (4,9), (3,9). So (8,9) doesn't have an apple, but it might be a good path to get to one.\n\nLooking at the other apples: (7,9) is just left of me. So if I move left to (8,9), then next turn I can move to (7,9) to eat that apple. That seems like a solid plan.\n\nAlternatively, moving down to (9,8) would take me back to where I was, but since that's my body, I can't go there because I would run into myself and die. So moving down is not an option.\n\nWait, no, the snake can sometimes move over its own body if it's growing, but I'm not sure about the rules here. Rule 3 says you die if you run into yourself. So moving down would take me into (9,8), which is my previous position, so that's part of my body now. So moving down would make me die. So I can't go down.\n\nSo my only option is to move left to (8,9). That way, I can approach the apple at (7,9). Also, I need to check if there are any enemy snakes nearby. Enemy snake #1 is at (3,7). That's quite far from me right now, so I don't have to worry about it immediately.\n\nSo the plan is to move left to (8,9) now. Next turn, I can move left again to (7,9) to eat that apple. Then, I'll have another point and keep growing. I should also look ahead to see if there are other nearby apples I can reach after eating (7,9). The next closest is (4,9), but that's further left. But since I'm moving left, I might as well go for that as well.\n\nI also need to make sure that when I move left, I don't run into any walls or other obstacles. Since (8,9) is within the board, it's safe. There are no enemy snakes or other parts of my body in that spot, as far as I can tell.\n\nWait, let me double-check the board state. The board shows that at y=9, the positions are: 9 has me (snake 2), 7 has an apple, 4 and 3 have apples too. So moving left to (8,9) is clear. Also, I don't see any enemy snakes near the top row.\n\nSo, conclusion: move LEFT to (8,9) to approach the apple at (7,9).\n</think>\n\nI need to move left to (8,9) to position myself towards the next apple at (7,9). Moving down or right would either cause me to collide with myself or go out of bounds.\n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the next move for my snake in this game. Let me go through the information step by step. \n\nFirst, the board is a 10x10 grid, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake, ID 2, is currently at (7,9). The apples are at positions (4,9), (1,2), (6,5), (2,1), and (6,7). There's also another snake, snake #1, which is at (3,9) with a body segment at (3,8). \n\nIn the last move, I went LEFT from (9,9) to (8,9) to approach the apple at (7,9) without hitting my own body. Now I'm at (8,9). Wait, no, the last move was to position (7,9)? Or maybe I got confused because the current position is (7,9). Let me clarify. The user's last move was LEFT, so if their previous position was (9,9), moving left would take them to (8,9). But now, according to the current state, they're at (7,9). So perhaps I misread earlier. Let me check again. The board state shows the snake at (7,9), so that's their current position.\n\nLooking at the board, the apples are scattered, but the closest ones to me right now are the ones at (7,9) is where I am, but that's my position, so maybe I just ate that apple. Wait, no, the apple is at (7,9), and I'm at (7,9). So does that mean I just ate that apple and grew? But I'm not sure if that's the case because in the last move, the rationale was to move left to approach (7,9), which is where the apple is. So maybe in the last move, I moved from (9,9) to (8,9), then to (7,9) now, and ate the apple. So I've grown by one segment, and now my body includes (7,9), (8,9), etc.\n\nNow, I need to decide the next direction. Let me think about possible directions: UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT. But wait, the coordinates system might be a bit tricky. Decreasing y is down, increasing y is up. Decreasing x is left, increasing x is right.\n\nLooking at my current position (7,9), I'm at the top row (since y=9 is the highest). So trying to go UP from here would take me to y=10, which is outside the board, so that's a wall. That would make me die, so I can't go UP.\n\nTo the LEFT would be x=6, so (6,9). I need to check if that's safe. Is there an enemy snake there? The enemy snake is at (3,9) with a body at (3,8), so no. The closest apple is at (4,9), which is two steps to the left. So moving LEFT might be a way to approach that apple.\n\nTo the RIGHT would be x=8, so (8,9), but that's where I came from, and since my snake's body might be following, I need to make sure I'm not going to run into myself. Wait, the board shows me at (7,9) and the last move was to get there. So my body would be behind me. If I go RIGHT, I'd be moving back towards (8,9) which is part of my body now, so that would cause me to die. So RIGHT is out of the question.\n\nWhat about DOWN? That would be y=8, so (7,8). Is that safe? Let's check the board for any other snakes or walls. There's nothing blocking at (7,8) as far as I can see. The enemy snake is at (3,9) and (3,8), so (3,8) is occupied, but (7,8) is clear. So moving DOWN to (7,8) is possible.\n\nNow, considering the apples, the closest one to me is at (4,9) if I go LEFT. If I go LEFT to (6,9), I can move towards (4,9) which is two steps further. Alternatively, if I go DOWN to (7,8), I might not be heading towards any apple directly, but perhaps I can go towards (6,7) or (6,5) later.\n\nWait, the apples are at (4,9), (1,2), (6,5), (2,1), and (6,7). So moving LEFT towards (4,9) might be a good idea because it's in the same row, and getting that apple would give me a point. Also, since I'm already at (7,9), moving LEFT to (6,9) then LEFT again to (5,9), then to (4,9) would get me there.\n\nBut I need to make sure that there's nothing blocking my path. The enemy snake is at (3,9), but as I move LEFT, I'd be going through (6,9), (5,9), etc., which are clear.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) could allow me to navigate towards other apples, but it's not as direct. Let me see what the benefits are. If I go LEFT, I can get the apple at (4,9) in three moves, which would give me a point and make me longer. That's a good move because it's a nearby apple and easy to reach without much obstruction.\n\nAnother consideration is avoiding the enemy snake. If I go LEFT towards (4,9), I'd be moving away from the enemy snake at (3,9). But if I go DOWN, I'm moving into the area where the enemy snake's body is at (3,8), but that's a few steps away, so I might not hit it unless I approach directly.\n\nSo, weighing the options, moving LEFT towards (4,9) seems like the best choice. It's the closest apple, and moving in that direction doesn't have any immediate dangers, as far as I can tell.\n\nAdditionally, moving LEFT won't make me run into my own body because my last move was from (8,9) to (7,9), so my body is at (7,9) and (8,9). If I move LEFT to (6,9), I won't be colliding with myself because the body segments follow the head, so in the next move, the tail would move as well.\n\nWait, no, actually, in the game, when a snake moves, each segment follows the previous one. So if I was at (9,9), then moved to (8,9), then to (7,9), my body would be from (7,9) to (9,9). So moving LEFT would be to (6,9), which is clear.\n\nWait, but the board shows me at (7,9), so perhaps I've already moved there, and my body is at (8,9) and (9,9). So moving LEFT to (6,9) should be safe.\n\nSo, to sum up, moving LEFT is the best option because it leads me towards the nearest apple at (4,9) without any immediate threats. Therefore, my next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nNext move: LEFT"
