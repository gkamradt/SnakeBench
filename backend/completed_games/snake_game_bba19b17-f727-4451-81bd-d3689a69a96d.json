This puts me next to the enemy snake at (5,5), risking a collision next turn.\n* LEFT: Moves me to (6,6). This puts me a bit closer to several apples. No immediate danger.\n* RIGHT: Moves me to (8,6). This puts me closer to the apple at (9,0), and further from all other apples. No immediate danger.\n\n\nThe apples at (5,0), (3,2), and (5,3) are probably too risky to go after due to the enemy snake. The apple at (9,0) seems like the safest bet for now. Both UP and RIGHT move me closer to that apple. LEFT puts me closer to the cluster of apples in the center, but also closer to the enemy snake.
