            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is at position (9,7), which is in the bottom part of the grid, towards the right. There are apples at (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), and (5,5). There's also an enemy snake at (4,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy position is (9,7), which is towards the bottom-right. The apples are scattered around the grid: one at (6,4), which is a bit to the upper-left; one at (1,3), which is near the left side, not too high; (3,1), which is lower down on the left; (7,1), which is lower down on the right; and (5,5), which is more in the center.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and also consider the position of the enemy snake. The enemy is at (4,5), so it's in the middle-left area.\n\nLet me calculate the Manhattan distances from my position to each apple:\n\n- To (6,4): |9-6| + |7-4| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- To (1,3): |9-1| + |7-3| = 8 + 4 = 12\n\n- To (3,1): |9-3| + |7-1| = 6 + 6 = 12\n\n- To (7,1): |9-7| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- To (5,5): |9-5| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (6,4) and (5,5), both with a distance of 6. The apple at (7,1) is a bit farther at 8, and the others are even farther at 12.\n\nI should probably go for one of the closer apples first. Let's see which path would be safer.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (9,7), moving up towards (5,5) would involve going up to (9,8), then (9,9), then left to (8,9), etc. But I need to see if there are any obstacles or the enemy in that path.\n\n- Moving to (6,4) would involve going up to (9,8), (9,9), then left to (8,9), (7,9), and so on down to (6,4).\n\nWait, actually, to get to (6,4), going up to (9,9), then left to (6,9), then down to (6,4) would be a longer path. Maybe there's a shorter way.\n\nAlternatively, I could try moving left towards (6,7), then up to (6,4). Let's calculate that:\n\n- From (9,7) to (6,7): move left 3 steps.\n\n- From (6,7) to (6,4): move down 3 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 6, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nSimilarly, to (5,5):\n\n- From (9,7) to (5,7): left 4 steps.\n\n- From (5,7) to (5,5): down 2 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 6.\n\nSo both paths are equally long. Now, I need to consider the enemy's position.\n\nThe enemy is at (4,5). If I go to (5,5), I'll be close to the enemy. Maybe I should avoid that initially.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (6,4), which is a bit further away from the enemy, that might be safer.\n\nAlso, considering the other apples, if I go for (6,4), I can potentially set myself up for another apple afterward.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Go to (6,4).\n\n- Path: left 3 to (6,7), then down 3 to (6,4).\n\n- That's 6 steps.\n\n2. After eating (6,4), I can look for the next apple.\n\n- The next closest might be (5,5), which is now at a distance of |6-5| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n- So, from (6,4), move left to (5,4), then up to (5,5).\n\n- Total steps: 2.\n\n- Then, maybe go for (7,1), which is |5-7| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n\n- Path: right 2 to (7,5), then down 4 to (7,1).\n\n- Total steps: 6.\n\n- Then, maybe go for (1,3) or (3,1), whichever is closer.\n\nThis seems like a possible sequence: (6,4) -> (5,5) -> (7,1) -> (1,3) or (3,1).\n\nAlternatively, another sequence could be:\n\n1. Go to (5,5).\n\n- Path: left 4 to (5,7), then down 2 to (5,5).\n\n- Total steps: 6.\n\n2. Then go to (6,4): right 1, down 1. Steps: 2.\n\n3. Then (7,1): right 1, down 3. Steps: 4.\n\n4. Then (1,3): left 6, up 2. Steps: 8.\n\nThis seems longer than the first sequence.\n\nSo, perhaps the first sequence is better: go to (6,4), then (5,5), then (7,1), then another apple.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider the enemy's movement as well. If the enemy is at (4,5), and I'm going to (5,5), that might put me in its way.\n\nI should try to stay away from the enemy as much as possible, especially since it could be growing as well.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a corner where I can't turn back without hitting myself or a wall.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should aim for (7,1) directly from (9,7).\n\nPath to (7,1):\n\n- Left 2 to (7,7), then down 6 to (7,1). Total steps: 8.\n\nBut that's longer than going to (6,4) or (5,5), which are 6 steps away.\n\nAlso, after eating (7,1), the next closest apple would be (1,3) or (3,1), both at a distance of |7-1| + |1-3| = 6 + 2 = 8, or |7-3| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4.\n\nSo, (3,1) is closer after eating (7,1).\n\nSequence:\n\n1. (9,7) to (7,1): left 2, down 6. Steps: 8.\n\n2. Then (3,1): left 4, up 0. Steps: 4.\n\n3. Then (1,3): left 2, up 2. Steps: 4.\n\n4. Then (6,4): right 5, up 1. Steps: 6.\n\nTotal steps: 8 + 4 + 4 + 6 = 22.\n\nCompare to the first sequence:\n\n1. (9,7) to (6,4): left 3, down 3. Steps: 6.\n\n2. Then (5,5): left 1, up 1. Steps: 2.\n\n3. Then (7,1): right 2, down 4. Steps: 6.\n\n4. Then (1,3): left 6, up 2. Steps: 8.\n\nTotal steps: 6 + 2 + 6 + 8 = 22.\n\nSo, both sequences take the same total steps, but the first sequence gets me to apples faster, potentially allowing me to grow sooner and have more options.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy is at (4,5), going to (6,4) might be safer than going to (5,5), which is closer to the enemy.\n\nTherefore, maybe the best initial move is to go left towards (6,7).\n\nFrom there, I can assess the situation better and decide whether to go down to (6,4) or elsewhere.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that moving left from (9,7) is safe. Is there any part of my body there? According to the last move information, direction is none, rationale is none, which suggests that this is either the starting position or the snake hasn't moved yet.\n\nAssuming it's the starting position, my body is only at (9,7), so moving left to (8,7) is safe, as long as there are no other snakes or walls there.\n\nLooking at the board, (8,7) is empty. So, moving left is safe.\n\nAfter"

There are a few factors to consider here:\n\n1. **Distance to the apple**: I should probably go for the closest one to minimize the time and moves needed.\n\n2. **Safety**: I need to make sure that the path to the apple doesn't lead me into the enemy's territory or into a trap where I might collide with my own body or the wall.\n\n3. **Future planning**: After eating one apple, I should think about which apple to go for next in a way that optimizes my path and avoids unnecessary backtracking.\n\nLet's start by calculating the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- To (6,4): |9-6| + |7-4| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- To (1,3): |9-1| + |7-3| = 8 + 4 = 12\n\n- To (3,1): |9-3| + |7-1| = 6 + 6 = 12\n\n- To (7,1): |9-7| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- To (7,7): |9-7| + |7-7| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\nWait a minute, there's an apple at (7,7), which is very close to my current position at (9,7). The distance is only 2 steps to the left. That seems like the closest apple.\n\nBut looking back at the board state you provided:\n\n```\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . A 2 .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n5 . . . . T 1 . . . .\n\n4 . . . . . . A . . .\n\n3 . A . . . . . . . .\n\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n1 . . . A . . . A . .\n\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n```\n\nFrom this, it seems like there's an apple at (7,7), which is position 'A' in the grid, and I'm at (9,7), which is position '2'. So, yes, moving left twice would take me to the apple at (7,7).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe. According to the board, position (8,7) and (7,7) are both empty, so moving left twice should be fine.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,7), I would grow, so I need to make sure that I have a path to the next apple without running into myself or the enemy.\n\nLet's think about the next apple to go for after (7,7). The closest ones would be (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), or (5,5). But since I'll be at (7,7), let's recalculate the distances:\n\n- To (6,4): |7-6| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- To (1,3): |7-1| + |7-3| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- To (3,1): |7-3| + |7-1| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- To (7,1): |7-7| + |7-1| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- To (5,5): |7-5| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apples are now (6,4) and (5,5), both at a distance of 4.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (4,5), which is towards the middle-left. If I go to (5,5), I'll be getting closer to the enemy, which might not be ideal. So, maybe I should consider going for (6,4) first.\n\nLet's plan a path from (7,7) to (6,4):\n\n- Left to (6,7), then down to (6,4): that's 1 left + 3 down = 4 steps.\n\nAlternatively, to (5,5):\n\n- Left to (5,7), then down to (5,5): 2 left + 2 down = 4 steps.\n\nSo, both paths are equally long. But since (6,4) is slightly away from the enemy, I'll prefer that.\n\nAfter eating (6,4), the next apple to go for would be (5,5), which is now closer, or maybe (7,1), depending on the board state.\n\nBut let's not get too ahead. First, I need to make sure I can safely get to (7,7) and then to (6,4).\n\nWait a second, looking back at the board, there's an apple at (7,7), but there's also my position '2' there. Does that mean I'm already at (7,7)? Wait, no, the board shows 'A' at (7,7) and '2' at (9,7). So, I'm at (9,7), and the apple is at (7,7).\n\nOkay, so moving left twice will take me to (7,7), where the apple is.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating the apple, my body extends, and I don't collide with it. Since I'm moving left, my tail will be at (9,7), and my head will be at (7,7). So, my body will be at (8,7) and (7,7).\n\nThen, next move, I need to continue moving without hitting my own body. So, from (7,7), I can move to (6,7), then down to (6,6), and so on, towards (6,4).\n\nBut wait, I need to think about the enemy's possible moves as well. The enemy is at (4,5), and it could be moving in any direction. I need to anticipate its movement and avoid collisions.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the enemy's velocity or its intended path, I'll have to make some assumptions. Probably, the enemy is trying to reach the closest apple as well.\n\nGiven that, I should try to minimize the time I'm exposed to the enemy. So, if I go for (7,7) and then (6,4), I'm moving left and down, away from the enemy, which is at (4,5).\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (5,5), I'm moving left and up, closer to the enemy.\n\nTherefore, going for (6,4) first seems like a better idea in terms of safety.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move left to (8,7)\n\n2. Move left to (7,7) to eat the apple\n\n3. Move left to (6,7)\n\n4. Move down to (6,6)\n\n5. Move down to (6,5)\n\n6. Move down to (6,4) to eat the next apple\n\nThen, assess the situation again.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that moving down from (6,7) to (6,4) is safe. I should check if there are any obstacles or the enemy in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, between (6,7) and (6,4), there are positions (6,6), (6,5), and (6,4). From the board, position (6,4) has an apple, and the rest seem empty.\n\nBut I need to consider if the enemy might reach that area before me.\n\nGiven that, I should try to move quickly to (7,7) and then to (6,4), minimizing the time the enemy can intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for a different apple that's less exposed.\n\nLet me consider going for (7,1) instead of (6,4). The path would be:\n\n- From (9,7), move left to (7,7), then down to (7,1).\n\nThat's 2 left + 6 down = 8 steps.\n\nComparing to the previous path to (6,4), which is 3 left + 3 down = 6 steps.\n\nSo, going to (6,4) is faster.\n\nBut, after eating (6,4), I need to go to another apple. Let's say I go to (5,5): 1 left + 1 down = 2 steps.\n\nThen, to (7,1): 2 right + 4 down = 6 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 6 (to 6,4) + 2 (to 5,5) + 6 (to 7,1) = 14"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is at position (9,7), which is in the bottom part of the grid, towards the right. There are apples at (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), and (5,5). There's also an enemy snake at (4,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy position is (9,7), which is towards the bottom-right. The apples are scattered around the grid: one at (6,4), which is a bit to the upper-left; one at (1,3), which is near the left side, not too high; (3,1), which is lower down on the left; (7,1), which is lower down on the right; and (5,5), which is more in the center.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and also consider the position of the enemy snake. The enemy is at (4,5), so it's in the middle-left area.\n\nLet me calculate the Manhattan distances from my position to each apple:\n\n- To (6,4): |9-6| + |7-4| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- To (1,3): |9-1| + |7-3| = 8 + 4 = 12\n\n- To (3,1): |9-3| + |7-1| = 6 + 6 = 12\n\n- To (7,1): |9-7| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- To (5,5): |9-5| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (6,4) and (5,5), both with a distance of 6. The apple at (7,1) is a bit farther at 8, and the others are even farther at 12.\n\nI should probably go for one of the closer apples first. Let's see which path would be safer.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (9,7), moving up towards (5,5) would involve going up to (9,8), then (9,9), then left to (8,9), etc. But I need to see if there are any obstacles or the enemy in that path.\n\n- Moving to (6,4) would involve going up to (9,8), (9,9), then left to (8,9), (7,9), and so on down to (6,4).\n\nWait, actually, to get to (6,4), going up to (9,9), then left to (6,9), then down to (6,4) would be a longer path. Maybe there's a shorter way.\n\nAlternatively, I could try moving left towards (6,7), then up to (6,4). Let's calculate that:\n\n- From (9,7) to (6,7): move left 3 steps.\n\n- From (6,7) to (6,4): move down 3 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 6, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nSimilarly, to (5,5):\n\n- From (9,7) to (5,7): left 4 steps.\n\n- From (5,7) to (5,5): down 2 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 6.\n\nSo both paths are equally long. Now, I need to consider the enemy's position.\n\nThe enemy is at (4,5). If I go to (5,5), I'll be close to the enemy. Maybe I should avoid that initially.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (6,4), which is a bit further away from the enemy, that might be safer.\n\nAlso, considering the other apples, if I go for (6,4), I can potentially set myself up for another apple afterward.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Go to (6,4).\n\n- Path: left 3 to (6,7), then down 3 to (6,4).\n\n- That's 6 steps.\n\n2. After eating (6,4), I can look for the next apple.\n\n- The next closest might be (5,5), which is now at a distance of |6-5| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n- So, from (6,4), move left to (5,4), then up to (5,5).\n\n- Total steps: 2.\n\n- Then, maybe go for (7,1), which is |5-7| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n\n- Path: right 2 to (7,5), then down 4 to (7,1).\n\n- Total steps: 6.\n\n- Then, maybe go for (1,3) or (3,1), whichever is closer.\n\nThis seems like a possible sequence: (6,4) -> (5,5) -> (7,1) -> (1,3) or (3,1).\n\nAlternatively, another sequence could be:\n\n1. Go to (5,5).\n\n- Path: left 4 to (5,7), then down 2 to (5,5).\n\n- Total steps: 6.\n\n2. Then go to (6,4): right 1, down 1. Steps: 2.\n\n3. Then (7,1): right 1, down 3. Steps: 4.\n\n4. Then (1,3): left 6, up 2. Steps: 8.\n\nThis seems longer than the first sequence.\n\nSo, perhaps the first sequence is better: go to (6,4), then (5,5), then (7,1), then another apple.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider the enemy's movement as well. If the enemy is at (4,5), and I'm going to (5,5), that might put me in its way.\n\nI should try to stay away from the enemy as much as possible, especially since it could be growing as well.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a corner where I can't turn back without hitting myself or a wall.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should aim for (7,1) directly from (9,7).\n\nPath to (7,1):\n\n- Left 2 to (7,7), then down 6 to (7,1). Total steps: 8.\n\nBut that's longer than going to (6,4) or (5,5), which are 6 steps away.\n\nAlso, after eating (7,1), the next closest apple would be (1,3) or (3,1), both at a distance of |7-1| + |1-3| = 6 + 2 = 8, or |7-3| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4.\n\nSo, (3,1) is closer after eating (7,1).\n\nSequence:\n\n1. (9,7) to (7,1): left 2, down 6. Steps: 8.\n\n2. Then (3,1): left 4, up 0. Steps: 4.\n\n3. Then (1,3): left 2, up 2. Steps: 4.\n\n4. Then (6,4): right 5, up 1. Steps: 6.\n\nTotal steps: 8 + 4 + 4 + 6 = 22.\n\nCompare to the first sequence:\n\n1. (9,7) to (6,4): left 3, down 3. Steps: 6.\n\n2. Then (5,5): left 1, up 1. Steps: 2.\n\n3. Then (7,1): right 2, down 4. Steps: 6.\n\n4. Then (1,3): left 6, up 2. Steps: 8.\n\nTotal steps: 6 + 2 + 6 + 8 = 22.\n\nSo, both sequences take the same total steps, but the first sequence gets me to apples faster, potentially allowing me to grow sooner and have more options.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy is at (4,5), going to (6,4) might be safer than going to (5,5), which is closer to the enemy.\n\nTherefore, maybe the best initial move is to go left towards (6,7).\n\nFrom there, I can assess the situation better and decide whether to go down to (6,4) or elsewhere.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that moving left from (9,7) is safe. Is there any part of my body there? According to the last move information, direction is none, rationale is none, which suggests that this is either the starting position or the snake hasn't moved yet.\n\nAssuming it's the starting position, my body is only at (9,7), so moving left to (8,7) is safe, as long as there are no other snakes or walls there.\n\nLooking at the board, (8,7) is empty. So, moving left is safe.\n\nAfter"

The path would be:\n\n- From (9,7), move left to (7,7), then down to (7,1).\n\nThat's 2 left + 6 down = 8 steps.\n\nComparing to the previous path to (6,4), which is 3 left + 3 down = 6 steps.\n\nSo, going to (6,4) is faster.\n\nBut, after eating (6,4), I need to go to another apple. Let's say I go to (5,5): 1 left + 1 down = 2 steps.\n\nThen, to (7,1): 2 right + 4 down = 6 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 6 (to 6,4) + 2 (to 5,5) + 6 (to 7,1) = 14"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm in this multi-apple snake game, and I need to figure out my next move. Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. That means y increases as we go up, which is a bit counterintuitive, but I need to keep that in mind.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,6). Hmm, looking at the board state you provided:\n\n```\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . A . .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . 2 .\n\n5 . . . . . T 1 . . .\n\n4 . . . . . .

There are apples at (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), and (7,7), which are marked as 'A's.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (6,5), with its body at (5,5), marked as '1' and 'T' (probably the tail).\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, and I need to maximize my score by eating as many as possible without dying.\n\nFirst, I should consider the distance to each apple from my current position. Since the board uses Manhattan distance (given the way movement is described), I'll calculate the distances accordingly.\n\nFrom (8,6):\n\n- To (6,4): |8-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (1,3): |8-1| + |6-3| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\n- To (3,1): |8-3| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- To (7,1): |8-7| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- To (7,7): |8-7| + |6-7| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,7) with a distance of 2, followed by (6,4) at distance 4, and then (7,1) at 6, and the others are farther.\n\nBut, I need to consider not just the distance but also the safety of the path to each apple. I have to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or into my own body.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (6,5), with its body at (5,5). So, it's to the left and a bit down from me.\n\nIf I go to (7,7), which is left and up from my current position, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving in a way that could intercept me.\n\nPossible moves for the enemy: It could go left, right, up, or down, but I don't know its intentions.\n\nAssuming it's trying to reach the nearest apple as well, perhaps it's going for one of the apples in its vicinity.\n\nBut to play it safe, I should prioritize the apple that minimizes the interaction with the enemy.\n\nGiven that, going to (7,7) seems okay because it's away from the enemy's current position.\n\nAfter eating (7,7), I would grow, so my tail would extend. Then, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's say I eat (7,7), then head to (6,4). From (7,7), the distance to (6,4) is |7-6| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (7,1), which is |7-7| + |7-1| = 0 + 6 = 6.\n\nSo, (6,4) is closer.\n\nBut, I need to consider the path.\n\nFrom (7,7) to (6,4):\n\n- Left to (6,7)\n\n- Down to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\nThat's 1 left and 3 downs, total 4 moves.\n\nBut, (6,5) is where the enemy is currently at. I need to make sure that by the time I get there, the enemy has moved away.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (7,1) after (7,7).\n\nFrom (7,7) to (7,1):\n\n- Down 6 times.\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nComparing to going to (6,4), which is 4 moves, versus 6 moves to (7,1).\n\nSo, (6,4) is faster.\n\nBut, considering the enemy is at (6,5), which is on the path to (6,4), I need to be cautious.\n\nPerhaps I should consider going for (5,5) after (6,4), but wait, (5,5) isn't an apple. Oh, perhaps I was thinking of (5,5) as part of the path, but it's not an apple.\n\nWait, the apples are at (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), and (7,7). So, no (5,5).\n\nI need to plan my path carefully.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider which apples are in clusters, so I can eat multiple apples in one go without traveling too far.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (7,1)\n\n- (7,7)\n\nSo, (7,7) and (7,1) are in the same column, 6 rows apart.\n\n(6,4), (1,3), and (3,1) are spread out.\n\nPerhaps I can go for (7,7), then (7,1), then (6,4), then the others.\n\nBut that seems inefficient because (7,7) to (7,1) is a long path, 6 moves down.\n\nAlternatively, (7,7) to (6,4) is shorter, only 4 moves.\n\nI think the better strategy is to go for the closer apples first, minimizing the total movement.\n\nSo, starting from (8,6):\n\n1. Go to (7,7) to eat the apple (2 moves: left twice).\n\n2. Then go to (6,4) (4 moves: left once, then down three times).\n\nTotal: 6 moves.\n\nThen, from (6,4), I can look for the next closest apple.\n\nAt (6,4), the closest apples would be (1,3) at |6-1| + |4-3| = 5 + 1 = 6, and (3,1) at |6-3| + |4-1| = 3 + 3 = 6, and (7,1) at |6-7| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, (7,1) is closest from there, at 4 moves.\n\nThen, from (7,1), to (1,3): |7-1| + |1-3| = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, from (7,1), to (3,1): |7-3| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4.\n\nSo, going from (7,1) to (3,1) is 4 moves left.\n\nThen, from (3,1) to (1,3): |3-1| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nTotal moves: 2 (to 7,7) + 4 (to 6,4) + 4 (to 7,1) + 4 (to 3,1) + 4 (to 1,3) = 18 moves.\n\nAlternatively, another order:\n\n(7,7) -> (7,1) -> (6,4) -> (3,1) -> (1,3).\n\nFrom (7,7) to (7,1): 6 down.\n\nFrom (7,1) to (6,4): up three and left three: total 6 moves.\n\nFrom (6,4) to (3,1): left three and down three: 6 moves.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (1,3): left two and up two: 4 moves.\n\nTotal: 2 (to 7,7) + 6 (to 7,1) + 6 (to 6,4) + 6 (to 3,1) + 4 (to 1,3) = 24 moves.\n\nWait, that's worse than the previous plan.\n\nSo, the first plan seems better: 18 moves.\n\nBut I need to consider time"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is at position (9,7), which is in the bottom part of the grid, towards the right. There are apples at (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), and (5,5). There's also an enemy snake at (4,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy position is (9,7), which is towards the bottom-right. The apples are scattered around the grid: one at (6,4), which is a bit to the upper-left; one at (1,3), which is near the left side, not too high; (3,1), which is lower down on the left; (7,1), which is lower down on the right; and (5,5), which is more in the center.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and also consider the position of the enemy snake. The enemy is at (4,5), so it's in the middle-left area.\n\nLet me calculate the Manhattan distances from my position to each apple:\n\n- To (6,4): |9-6| + |7-4| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- To (1,3): |9-1| + |7-3| = 8 + 4 = 12\n\n- To (3,1): |9-3| + |7-1| = 6 + 6 = 12\n\n- To (7,1): |9-7| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- To (5,5): |9-5| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (6,4) and (5,5), both with a distance of 6. The apple at (7,1) is a bit farther at 8, and the others are even farther at 12.\n\nI should probably go for one of the closer apples first. Let's see which path would be safer.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (9,7), moving up towards (5,5) would involve going up to (9,8), then (9,9), then left to (8,9), etc. But I need to see if there are any obstacles or the enemy in that path.\n\n- Moving to (6,4) would involve going up to (9,8), (9,9), then left to (8,9), (7,9), and so on down to (6,4).\n\nWait, actually, to get to (6,4), going up to (9,9), then left to (6,9), then down to (6,4) would be a longer path. Maybe there's a shorter way.\n\nAlternatively, I could try moving left towards (6,7), then up to (6,4). Let's calculate that:\n\n- From (9,7) to (6,7): move left 3 steps.\n\n- From (6,7) to (6,4): move down 3 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 6, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nSimilarly, to (5,5):\n\n- From (9,7) to (5,7): left 4 steps.\n\n- From (5,7) to (5,5): down 2 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 6.\n\nSo both paths are equally long. Now, I need to consider the enemy's position.\n\nThe enemy is at (4,5). If I go to (5,5), I'll be close to the enemy. Maybe I should avoid that initially.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (6,4), which is a bit further away from the enemy, that might be safer.\n\nAlso, considering the other apples, if I go for (6,4), I can potentially set myself up for another apple afterward.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Go to (6,4).\n\n- Path: left 3 to (6,7), then down 3 to (6,4).\n\n- That's 6 steps.\n\n2. After eating (6,4), I can look for the next apple.\n\n- The next closest might be (5,5), which is now at a distance of |6-5| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n- So, from (6,4), move left to (5,4), then up to (5,5).\n\n- Total steps: 2.\n\n- Then, maybe go for (7,1), which is |5-7| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n\n- Path: right 2 to (7,5), then down 4 to (7,1).\n\n- Total steps: 6.\n\n- Then, maybe go for (1,3) or (3,1), whichever is closer.\n\nThis seems like a possible sequence: (6,4) -> (5,5) -> (7,1) -> (1,3) or (3,1).\n\nAlternatively, another sequence could be:\n\n1. Go to (5,5).\n\n- Path: left 4 to (5,7), then down 2 to (5,5).\n\n- Total steps: 6.\n\n2. Then go to (6,4): right 1, down 1. Steps: 2.\n\n3. Then (7,1): right 1, down 3. Steps: 4.\n\n4. Then (1,3): left 6, up 2. Steps: 8.\n\nThis seems longer than the first sequence.\n\nSo, perhaps the first sequence is better: go to (6,4), then (5,5), then (7,1), then another apple.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider the enemy's movement as well. If the enemy is at (4,5), and I'm going to (5,5), that might put me in its way.\n\nI should try to stay away from the enemy as much as possible, especially since it could be growing as well.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a corner where I can't turn back without hitting myself or a wall.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should aim for (7,1) directly from (9,7).\n\nPath to (7,1):\n\n- Left 2 to (7,7), then down 6 to (7,1). Total steps: 8.\n\nBut that's longer than going to (6,4) or (5,5), which are 6 steps away.\n\nAlso, after eating (7,1), the next closest apple would be (1,3) or (3,1), both at a distance of |7-1| + |1-3| = 6 + 2 = 8, or |7-3| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4.\n\nSo, (3,1) is closer after eating (7,1).\n\nSequence:\n\n1. (9,7) to (7,1): left 2, down 6. Steps: 8.\n\n2. Then (3,1): left 4, up 0. Steps: 4.\n\n3. Then (1,3): left 2, up 2. Steps: 4.\n\n4. Then (6,4): right 5, up 1. Steps: 6.\n\nTotal steps: 8 + 4 + 4 + 6 = 22.\n\nCompare to the first sequence:\n\n1. (9,7) to (6,4): left 3, down 3. Steps: 6.\n\n2. Then (5,5): left 1, up 1. Steps: 2.\n\n3. Then (7,1): right 2, down 4. Steps: 6.\n\n4. Then (1,3): left 6, up 2. Steps: 8.\n\nTotal steps: 6 + 2 + 6 + 8 = 22.\n\nSo, both sequences take the same total steps, but the first sequence gets me to apples faster, potentially allowing me to grow sooner and have more options.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy is at (4,5), going to (6,4) might be safer than going to (5,5), which is closer to the enemy.\n\nTherefore, maybe the best initial move is to go left towards (6,7).\n\nFrom there, I can assess the situation better and decide whether to go down to (6,4) or elsewhere.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that moving left from (9,7) is safe. Is there any part of my body there? According to the last move information, direction is none, rationale is none, which suggests that this is either the starting position or the snake hasn't moved yet.\n\nAssuming it's the starting position, my body is only at (9,7), so moving left to (8,7) is safe, as long as there are no other snakes or walls there.\n\nLooking at the board, (8,7) is empty. So, moving left is safe.\n\nAfter"

So, first things first, I need to understand where I am and where everything else is.\n\nI'm currently at position (9,7), which is towards the bottom-right of the board. The apples are at (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), and (7,7). There's also an enemy snake at (4,5) with its body at (4,5), but it seems like it's just the head for now.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are a few factors to consider here:\n\n1. **Distance to the apple**: I should probably go for the closest one to minimize the time and moves needed.\n\n2. **Safety**: I need to make sure that the path to the apple doesn't lead me into the enemy's territory or into a trap where I might collide with my own body or the wall.\n\n3. **Future planning**: After eating one apple, I should think about which apple to go for next in a way that optimizes my path and avoids unnecessary backtracking.\n\nLet's start by calculating the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- To (6,4): |9-6| + |7-4| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- To (1,3): |9-1| + |7-3| = 8 + 4 = 12\n\n- To (3,1): |9-3| + |7-1| = 6 + 6 = 12\n\n- To (7,1): |9-7| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- To (7,7): |9-7| + |7-7| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\nWait a minute, there's an apple at (7,7), which is very close to my current position at (9,7). The distance is only 2 steps to the left. That seems like the closest apple.\n\nBut looking back at the board state you provided:\n\n```\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . A 2 .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n5 . . . . T 1 . . . .\n\n4 . . . . . . A . . .\n\n3 . A . . . . . . . .\n\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n1 . . . A . . . A . .\n\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n```\n\nFrom this, it seems like there's an apple at (7,7), which is position 'A' in the grid, and I'm at (9,7), which is position '2'. So, yes, moving left twice would take me to the apple at (7,7).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe. According to the board, position (8,7) and (7,7) are both empty, so moving left twice should be fine.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,7), I would grow, so I need to make sure that I have a path to the next apple without running into myself or the enemy.\n\nLet's think about the next apple to go for after (7,7). The closest ones would be (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), or (5,5). But since I'll be at (7,7), let's recalculate the distances:\n\n- To (6,4): |7-6| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- To (1,3): |7-1| + |7-3| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- To (3,1): |7-3| + |7-1| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- To (7,1): |7-7| + |7-1| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- To (5,5): |7-5| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apples are now (6,4) and (5,5), both at a distance of 4.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (4,5), which is towards the middle-left. If I go to (5,5), I'll be getting closer to the enemy, which might not be ideal. So, maybe I should consider going for (6,4) first.\n\nLet's plan a path from (7,7) to (6,4):\n\n- Left to (6,7), then down to (6,4): that's 1 left + 3 down = 4 steps.\n\nAlternatively, to (5,5):\n\n- Left to (5,7), then down to (5,5): 2 left + 2 down = 4 steps.\n\nSo, both paths are equally long. But since (6,4) is slightly away from the enemy, I'll prefer that.\n\nAfter eating (6,4), the next apple to go for would be (5,5), which is now closer, or maybe (7,1), depending on the board state.\n\nBut let's not get too ahead. First, I need to make sure I can safely get to (7,7) and then to (6,4).\n\nWait a second, looking back at the board, there's an apple at (7,7), but there's also my position '2' there. Does that mean I'm already at (7,7)? Wait, no, the board shows 'A' at (7,7) and '2' at (9,7). So, I'm at (9,7), and the apple is at (7,7).\n\nOkay, so moving left twice will take me to (7,7), where the apple is.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating the apple, my body extends, and I don't collide with it. Since I'm moving left, my tail will be at (9,7), and my head will be at (7,7). So, my body will be at (8,7) and (7,7).\n\nThen, next move, I need to continue moving without hitting my own body. So, from (7,7), I can move to (6,7), then down to (6,6), and so on, towards (6,4).\n\nBut wait, I need to think about the enemy's possible moves as well. The enemy is at (4,5), and it could be moving in any direction. I need to anticipate its movement and avoid collisions.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the enemy's velocity or its intended path, I'll have to make some assumptions. Probably, the enemy is trying to reach the closest apple as well.\n\nGiven that, I should try to minimize the time I'm exposed to the enemy. So, if I go for (7,7) and then (6,4), I'm moving left and down, away from the enemy, which is at (4,5).\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (5,5), I'm moving left and up, closer to the enemy.\n\nTherefore, going for (6,4) first seems like a better idea in terms of safety.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move left to (8,7)\n\n2. Move left to (7,7) to eat the apple\n\n3. Move left to (6,7)\n\n4. Move down to (6,6)\n\n5. Move down to (6,5)\n\n6. Move down to (6,4) to eat the next apple\n\nThen, assess the situation again.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that moving down from (6,7) to (6,4) is safe. I should check if there are any obstacles or the enemy in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, between (6,7) and (6,4), there are positions (6,6), (6,5), and (6,4). From the board, position (6,4) has an apple, and the rest seem empty.\n\nBut I need to consider if the enemy might reach that area before me.\n\nGiven that, I should try to move quickly to (7,7) and then to (6,4), minimizing the time the enemy can intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for a different apple that's less exposed.\n\nLet me consider going for (7,1) instead of (6,4). The path would be:\n\n- From (9,7), move left to (7,7), then down to (7,1).\n\nThat's 2 left + 6 down = 8 steps.\n\nComparing to the previous path to (6,4), which is 3 left + 3 down = 6 steps.\n\nSo, going to (6,4) is faster.\n\nBut, after eating (6,4), I need to go to another apple. Let's say I go to (5,5): 1 left + 1 down = 2 steps.\n\nThen, to (7,1): 2 right + 4 down = 6 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 6 (to 6,4) + 2 (to 5,5) + 6 (to 7,1) = 14"

Let's see what's going on here.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates starting at (0,0) at the bottom left and (9,9) at the top right. That means y increases as we go up, which is a bit counterintuitive, but I need to keep that in mind.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,6). Hmm, looking at the board state you provided:\n\n```\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . A . .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . 2 .\n\n5 . . . . . T 1 . . .\n\n4 . . . . . .

There are apples at (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), and (7,7), which are marked as 'A's.\n\nThere's also an enemy snake, ID 1, at (6,5), with its body at (5,5), marked as '1' and 'T' (probably the tail).\n\nOkay, I need to decide which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, and I need to maximize my score by eating as many as possible without dying.\n\nFirst, I should consider the distance to each apple from my current position. Since the board uses Manhattan distance (given the way movement is described), I'll calculate the distances accordingly.\n\nFrom (8,6):\n\n- To (6,4): |8-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (1,3): |8-1| + |6-3| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\n- To (3,1): |8-3| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- To (7,1): |8-7| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- To (7,7): |8-7| + |6-7| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,7) with a distance of 2, followed by (6,4) at distance 4, and then (7,1) at 6, and the others are farther.\n\nBut, I need to consider not just the distance but also the safety of the path to each apple. I have to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or into my own body.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (6,5), with its body at (5,5). So, it's to the left and a bit down from me.\n\nIf I go to (7,7), which is left and up from my current position, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving in a way that could intercept me.\n\nPossible moves for the enemy: It could go left, right, up, or down, but I don't know its intentions.\n\nAssuming it's trying to reach the nearest apple as well, perhaps it's going for one of the apples in its vicinity.\n\nBut to play it safe, I should prioritize the apple that minimizes the interaction with the enemy.\n\nGiven that, going to (7,7) seems okay because it's away from the enemy's current position.\n\nAfter eating (7,7), I would grow, so my tail would extend. Then, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's say I eat (7,7), then head to (6,4). From (7,7), the distance to (6,4) is |7-6| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (7,1), which is |7-7| + |7-1| = 0 + 6 = 6.\n\nSo, (6,4) is closer.\n\nBut, I need to consider the path.\n\nFrom (7,7) to (6,4):\n\n- Left to (6,7)\n\n- Down to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\nThat's 1 left and 3 downs, total 4 moves.\n\nBut, (6,5) is where the enemy is currently at. I need to make sure that by the time I get there, the enemy has moved away.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (7,1) after (7,7).\n\nFrom (7,7) to (7,1):\n\n- Down 6 times.\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nComparing to going to (6,4), which is 4 moves, versus 6 moves to (7,1).\n\nSo, (6,4) is faster.\n\nBut, considering the enemy is at (6,5), which is on the path to (6,4), I need to be cautious.\n\nPerhaps I should consider going for (5,5) after (6,4), but wait, (5,5) isn't an apple. Oh, perhaps I was thinking of (5,5) as part of the path, but it's not an apple.\n\nWait, the apples are at (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), and (7,7). So, no (5,5).\n\nI need to plan my path carefully.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider which apples are in clusters, so I can eat multiple apples in one go without traveling too far.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (7,1)\n\n- (7,7)\n\nSo, (7,7) and (7,1) are in the same column, 6 rows apart.\n\n(6,4), (1,3), and (3,1) are spread out.\n\nPerhaps I can go for (7,7), then (7,1), then (6,4), then the others.\n\nBut that seems inefficient because (7,7) to (7,1) is a long path, 6 moves down.\n\nAlternatively, (7,7) to (6,4) is shorter, only 4 moves.\n\nI think the better strategy is to go for the closer apples first, minimizing the total movement.\n\nSo, starting from (8,6):\n\n1. Go to (7,7) to eat the apple (2 moves: left twice).\n\n2. Then go to (6,4) (4 moves: left once, then down three times).\n\nTotal: 6 moves.\n\nThen, from (6,4), I can look for the next closest apple.\n\nAt (6,4), the closest apples would be (1,3) at |6-1| + |4-3| = 5 + 1 = 6, and (3,1) at |6-3| + |4-1| = 3 + 3 = 6, and (7,1) at |6-7| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, (7,1) is closest from there, at 4 moves.\n\nThen, from (7,1), to (1,3): |7-1| + |1-3| = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, from (7,1), to (3,1): |7-3| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4.\n\nSo, going from (7,1) to (3,1) is 4 moves left.\n\nThen, from (3,1) to (1,3): |3-1| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nTotal moves: 2 (to 7,7) + 4 (to 6,4) + 4 (to 7,1) + 4 (to 3,1) + 4 (to 1,3) = 18 moves.\n\nAlternatively, another order:\n\n(7,7) -> (7,1) -> (6,4) -> (3,1) -> (1,3).\n\nFrom (7,7) to (7,1): 6 down.\n\nFrom (7,1) to (6,4): up three and left three: total 6 moves.\n\nFrom (6,4) to (3,1): left three and down three: 6 moves.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (1,3): left two and up two: 4 moves.\n\nTotal: 2 (to 7,7) + 6 (to 7,1) + 6 (to 6,4) + 6 (to 3,1) + 4 (to 1,3) = 24 moves.\n\nWait, that's worse than the previous plan.\n\nSo, the first plan seems better: 18 moves.\n\nBut I need to consider time"

That means y increases as we go up, which is a bit counterintuitive, but I need to keep that in mind.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,7). Wait, in the board state you provided, it shows '2' at (8,6), but in the initial information, it says I'm at (8,7). There's a discrepancy here. Let's clarify that.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . .

A . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, '2' is at row 6, column 8, which is (8,6). But earlier it was mentioned as (8,7). Maybe there's a mistake in the initial position. I'll go with the board state, so I'm at (8,6).\n\nWait, but in the board, row 7 is y=7, row 6 is y=6, etc., with row 0 being y=0. So, '2' is at row 6, column 8, which is (8,6). But in the initial info, it says (8,7). Hmm, perhaps there's confusion between row and column. Let's make sure.\n\nCoordinates are (x,y), with x increasing to the right, y increasing upwards. So, bottom left is (0,0), top right is (9,9).\n\nGiven that, '2' is at (8,6), as per the board.\n\nOkay, moving on.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (7,1)\n\n- (7,7)\n\nEnemy snake ID 1 is at (7,5), with body at (6,5).\n\nSo, enemy head is at (7,5), body at (6,5).\n\nI need to plan my path to eat apples without hitting walls, enemy snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (8,6) to each apple:\n\n- To (6,4): |8-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (1,3): |8-1| + |6-3| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\n- To (3,1): |8-3| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- To (7,1): |8-7| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- To (7,7): |8-7| + |6-7| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,7) with a distance of 2, followed by (6,4) at distance 4, then (7,1) at 6, and the others at 10.\n\nI should probably go for the closest apple first, which is (7,7), to minimize the time and risk.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy's position and possible movements.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,5), with its body at (6,5). So, it's below (7,5), meaning it was previously at (6,5) and moved to (7,5).\n\nI need to predict where it might go next.\n\nAssuming the enemy is also trying to eat apples, it might go for the apple at (6,4), which is relatively close to it.\n\nFrom (7,5), the distance to (6,4) is |7-6| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nDistance to other apples:\n\n- (1,3): |7-1| + |5-3| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (3,1): |7-3| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (7,1): |7-7| + |5-1| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\n- (7,7): |7-7| + |5-7| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\nSo, the enemy has two apples at distance 2: (6,4) and (7,7). It might choose one based on direction or random choice.\n\nIf the enemy goes for (6,4), it would need to move left to (6,5), then down to (6,4).\n\nIf it goes for (7,7), it would need to move up to (7,6), then up to (7,7).\n\nI need to consider these possibilities and plan my path accordingly.\n\nLet's consider my path to (7,7):\n\nFrom (8,6), I can move left to (7,6), then up to (7,7).\n\nThat's two moves.\n\nDuring this time, the enemy is at (7,5). If it decides to go to (7,7), it would need to move up to (7,6), then up to (7,7).\n\nSo, if I move left to (7,6), and the enemy moves up to (7,6) as well, we would both be at (7,6) in the next move, resulting in a collision and both of us dying.\n\nThat's not good.\n\nAlternatively, if the enemy goes for (6,4), moving left to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then I can safely go to (7,7).\n\nBut I can't be sure about the enemy's intentions.\n\nTo minimize risk, perhaps I should choose a different path or target.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (6,4), which is closer to me than the enemy.\n\nWait, no. The apple at (6,4) is closer to the enemy than to me.\n\nWait, no. From my position (8,6), distance to (6,4) is 4, from enemy's position (7,5) to (6,4) is 2.\n\nSo, it's closer to the enemy.\n\nIf I go for (6,4), the enemy might intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (7,1), which is at (7,1). Distance from me is 5 down and 1 left, total 6 moves.\n\nFrom the enemy's position (7,5) to (7,1) is 4 down, which is 4 moves.\n\nSo, I would take 6 moves, enemy would take 4 moves, so it's still possible for the enemy to get there first.\n\nNot ideal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for (7,7), but find a way to avoid the enemy.\n\nIf I move left to (7,6), and the enemy moves up to (7,6), we collide.\n\nBut if I move up to (8,7), then left to (7,7), that might work.\n\nWait, from (8,6), up to (8,7), then left to (7,7).\n\nIn the first move, I go up to (8,7). The enemy could move up to (7,6).\n\nIn the second move, I go left to (7,7), and the enemy moves up to (7,7), causing a collision.\n\nStill a problem.\n\nAlternatively, if I go left to (7,6), and the enemy moves somewhere else, maybe down to (7,4).\n\nThen, in the next move, I can go up to (7,7) safely.\n\nBut I can't predict the enemy's moves.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for a different apple that's farther away but less contested.\n\nLike (1,3) or (3,1), which are both at distance 10 from me and 8 from the enemy.\n\nBut that would take too much time, and I might starve or get caught by the enemy on the way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to maneuver in a way that forces the enemy into a bad position.\n\nFor example, if I can box the enemy in or force it to make moves that leave it vulnerable.\n\nBut that seems complicated for now.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the potential paths and see which one has the least risk.\n\nLet's think about going to (7,7):\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move left to (7,6)\n\n- Move up to (7,7)\n\nRisk: Enemy moves up to (7,6), then up to (7,7), leading to collision."

There are apples at (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), and (5,5). There's also an enemy snake at (4,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy position is (9,7), which is towards the bottom-right. The apples are scattered around the grid: one at (6,4), which is a bit to the upper-left; one at (1,3), which is near the left side, not too high; (3,1), which is lower down on the left; (7,1), which is lower down on the right; and (5,5), which is more in the center.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and also consider the position of the enemy snake. The enemy is at (4,5), so it's in the middle-left area.\n\nLet me calculate the Manhattan distances from my position to each apple:\n\n- To (6,4): |9-6| + |7-4| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- To (1,3): |9-1| + |7-3| = 8 + 4 = 12\n\n- To (3,1): |9-3| + |7-1| = 6 + 6 = 12\n\n- To (7,1): |9-7| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- To (5,5): |9-5| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (6,4) and (5,5), both with a distance of 6. The apple at (7,1) is a bit farther at 8, and the others are even farther at 12.\n\nI should probably go for one of the closer apples first. Let's see which path would be safer.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (9,7), moving up towards (5,5) would involve going up to (9,8), then (9,9), then left to (8,9), etc. But I need to see if there are any obstacles or the enemy in that path.\n\n- Moving to (6,4) would involve going up to (9,8), (9,9), then left to (8,9), (7,9), and so on down to (6,4).\n\nWait, actually, to get to (6,4), going up to (9,9), then left to (6,9), then down to (6,4) would be a longer path. Maybe there's a shorter way.\n\nAlternatively, I could try moving left towards (6,7), then up to (6,4). Let's calculate that:\n\n- From (9,7) to (6,7): move left 3 steps.\n\n- From (6,7) to (6,4): move down 3 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 6, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nSimilarly, to (5,5):\n\n- From (9,7) to (5,7): left 4 steps.\n\n- From (5,7) to (5,5): down 2 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 6.\n\nSo both paths are equally long. Now, I need to consider the enemy's position.\n\nThe enemy is at (4,5). If I go to (5,5), I'll be close to the enemy. Maybe I should avoid that initially.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (6,4), which is a bit further away from the enemy, that might be safer.\n\nAlso, considering the other apples, if I go for (6,4), I can potentially set myself up for another apple afterward.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Go to (6,4).\n\n- Path: left 3 to (6,7), then down 3 to (6,4).\n\n- That's 6 steps.\n\n2. After eating (6,4), I can look for the next apple.\n\n- The next closest might be (5,5), which is now at a distance of |6-5| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n- So, from (6,4), move left to (5,4), then up to (5,5).\n\n- Total steps: 2.\n\n- Then, maybe go for (7,1), which is |5-7| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n\n- Path: right 2 to (7,5), then down 4 to (7,1).\n\n- Total steps: 6.\n\n- Then, maybe go for (1,3) or (3,1), whichever is closer.\n\nThis seems like a possible sequence: (6,4) -> (5,5) -> (7,1) -> (1,3) or (3,1).\n\nAlternatively, another sequence could be:\n\n1. Go to (5,5).\n\n- Path: left 4 to (5,7), then down 2 to (5,5).\n\n- Total steps: 6.\n\n2. Then go to (6,4): right 1, down 1. Steps: 2.\n\n3. Then (7,1): right 1, down 3. Steps: 4.\n\n4. Then (1,3): left 6, up 2. Steps: 8.\n\nThis seems longer than the first sequence.\n\nSo, perhaps the first sequence is better: go to (6,4), then (5,5), then (7,1), then another apple.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider the enemy's movement as well. If the enemy is at (4,5), and I'm going to (5,5), that might put me in its way.\n\nI should try to stay away from the enemy as much as possible, especially since it could be growing as well.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a corner where I can't turn back without hitting myself or a wall.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should aim for (7,1) directly from (9,7).\n\nPath to (7,1):\n\n- Left 2 to (7,7), then down 6 to (7,1). Total steps: 8.\n\nBut that's longer than going to (6,4) or (5,5), which are 6 steps away.\n\nAlso, after eating (7,1), the next closest apple would be (1,3) or (3,1), both at a distance of |7-1| + |1-3| = 6 + 2 = 8, or |7-3| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4.\n\nSo, (3,1) is closer after eating (7,1).\n\nSequence:\n\n1. (9,7) to (7,1): left 2, down 6. Steps: 8.\n\n2. Then (3,1): left 4, up 0. Steps: 4.\n\n3. Then (1,3): left 2, up 2. Steps: 4.\n\n4. Then (6,4): right 5, up 1. Steps: 6.\n\nTotal steps: 8 + 4 + 4 + 6 = 22.\n\nCompare to the first sequence:\n\n1. (9,7) to (6,4): left 3, down 3. Steps: 6.\n\n2. Then (5,5): left 1, up 1. Steps: 2.\n\n3. Then (7,1): right 2, down 4. Steps: 6.\n\n4. Then (1,3): left 6, up 2. Steps: 8.\n\nTotal steps: 6 + 2 + 6 + 8 = 22.\n\nSo, both sequences take the same total steps, but the first sequence gets me to apples faster, potentially allowing me to grow sooner and have more options.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy is at (4,5), going to (6,4) might be safer than going to (5,5), which is closer to the enemy.\n\nTherefore, maybe the best initial move is to go left towards (6,7).\n\nFrom there, I can assess the situation better and decide whether to go down to (6,4) or elsewhere.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that moving left from (9,7) is safe. Is there any part of my body there? According to the last move information, direction is none, rationale is none, which suggests that this is either the starting position or the snake hasn't moved yet.\n\nAssuming it's the starting position, my body is only at (9,7), so moving left to (8,7) is safe, as long as there are no other snakes or walls there.\n\nLooking at the board, (8,7) is empty. So, moving left is safe.\n\nAfter"

So, first things first, I need to understand where I am and where everything else is.\n\nI'm currently at position (9,7), which is towards the bottom-right of the board. The apples are at (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), and (7,7). There's also an enemy snake at (4,5) with its body at (4,5), but it seems like it's just the head for now.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are a few factors to consider here:\n\n1. **Distance to the apple**: I should probably go for the closest one to minimize the time and moves needed.\n\n2. **Safety**: I need to make sure that the path to the apple doesn't lead me into the enemy's territory or into a trap where I might collide with my own body or the wall.\n\n3. **Future planning**: After eating one apple, I should think about which apple to go for next in a way that optimizes my path and avoids unnecessary backtracking.\n\nLet's start by calculating the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- To (6,4): |9-6| + |7-4| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- To (1,3): |9-1| + |7-3| = 8 + 4 = 12\n\n- To (3,1): |9-3| + |7-1| = 6 + 6 = 12\n\n- To (7,1): |9-7| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- To (7,7): |9-7| + |7-7| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\nWait a minute, there's an apple at (7,7), which is very close to my current position at (9,7). The distance is only 2 steps to the left. That seems like the closest apple.\n\nBut looking back at the board state you provided:\n\n```\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . A 2 .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n5 . . . . T 1 . . . .\n\n4 . . . . . . A . . .\n\n3 . A . . . . . . . .\n\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n1 . . . A . . . A . .\n\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n```\n\nFrom this, it seems like there's an apple at (7,7), which is position 'A' in the grid, and I'm at (9,7), which is position '2'. So, yes, moving left twice would take me to the apple at (7,7).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe. According to the board, position (8,7) and (7,7) are both empty, so moving left twice should be fine.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,7), I would grow, so I need to make sure that I have a path to the next apple without running into myself or the enemy.\n\nLet's think about the next apple to go for after (7,7). The closest ones would be (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), or (5,5). But since I'll be at (7,7), let's recalculate the distances:\n\n- To (6,4): |7-6| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- To (1,3): |7-1| + |7-3| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- To (3,1): |7-3| + |7-1| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- To (7,1): |7-7| + |7-1| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- To (5,5): |7-5| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apples are now (6,4) and (5,5), both at a distance of 4.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (4,5), which is towards the middle-left. If I go to (5,5), I'll be getting closer to the enemy, which might not be ideal. So, maybe I should consider going for (6,4) first.\n\nLet's plan a path from (7,7) to (6,4):\n\n- Left to (6,7), then down to (6,4): that's 1 left + 3 down = 4 steps.\n\nAlternatively, to (5,5):\n\n- Left to (5,7), then down to (5,5): 2 left + 2 down = 4 steps.\n\nSo, both paths are equally long. But since (6,4) is slightly away from the enemy, I'll prefer that.\n\nAfter eating (6,4), the next apple to go for would be (5,5), which is now closer, or maybe (7,1), depending on the board state.\n\nBut let's not get too ahead. First, I need to make sure I can safely get to (7,7) and then to (6,4).\n\nWait a second, looking back at the board, there's an apple at (7,7), but there's also my position '2' there. Does that mean I'm already at (7,7)? Wait, no, the board shows 'A' at (7,7) and '2' at (9,7). So, I'm at (9,7), and the apple is at (7,7).\n\nOkay, so moving left twice will take me to (7,7), where the apple is.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating the apple, my body extends, and I don't collide with it. Since I'm moving left, my tail will be at (9,7), and my head will be at (7,7). So, my body will be at (8,7) and (7,7).\n\nThen, next move, I need to continue moving without hitting my own body. So, from (7,7), I can move to (6,7), then down to (6,6), and so on, towards (6,4).\n\nBut wait, I need to think about the enemy's possible moves as well. The enemy is at (4,5), and it could be moving in any direction. I need to anticipate its movement and avoid collisions.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the enemy's velocity or its intended path, I'll have to make some assumptions. Probably, the enemy is trying to reach the closest apple as well.\n\nGiven that, I should try to minimize the time I'm exposed to the enemy. So, if I go for (7,7) and then (6,4), I'm moving left and down, away from the enemy, which is at (4,5).\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (5,5), I'm moving left and up, closer to the enemy.\n\nTherefore, going for (6,4) first seems like a better idea in terms of safety.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move left to (8,7)\n\n2. Move left to (7,7) to eat the apple\n\n3. Move left to (6,7)\n\n4. Move down to (6,6)\n\n5. Move down to (6,5)\n\n6. Move down to (6,4) to eat the next apple\n\nThen, assess the situation again.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that moving down from (6,7) to (6,4) is safe. I should check if there are any obstacles or the enemy in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, between (6,7) and (6,4), there are positions (6,6), (6,5), and (6,4). From the board, position (6,4) has an apple, and the rest seem empty.\n\nBut I need to consider if the enemy might reach that area before me.\n\nGiven that, I should try to move quickly to (7,7) and then to (6,4), minimizing the time the enemy can intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for a different apple that's less exposed.\n\nLet me consider going for (7,1) instead of (6,4). The path would be:\n\n- From (9,7), move left to (7,7), then down to (7,1).\n\nThat's 2 left + 6 down = 8 steps.\n\nComparing to the previous path to (6,4), which is 3 left + 3 down = 6 steps.\n\nSo, going to (6,4) is faster.\n\nBut, after eating (6,4), I need to go to another apple. Let's say I go to (5,5): 1 left + 1 down = 2 steps.\n\nThen, to (7,1): 2 right + 4 down = 6 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 6 (to 6,4) + 2 (to 5,5) + 6 (to 7,1) = 14"

That means y increases as we go up, which is a bit counterintuitive, but I need to keep that in mind.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,6).

There are multiple apples, and I need to maximize my score by eating as many as possible without dying.\n\nFirst, I should consider the distance to each apple from my current position. Since the board uses Manhattan distance (given the way movement is described), I'll calculate the distances accordingly.\n\nFrom (8,6):\n\n- To (6,4): |8-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (1,3): |8-1| + |6-3| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\n- To (3,1): |8-3| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- To (7,1): |8-7| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- To (7,7): |8-7| + |6-7| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,7) with a distance of 2, followed by (6,4) at distance 4, and then (7,1) at 6, and the others are farther.\n\nBut, I need to consider not just the distance but also the safety of the path to each apple. I have to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or into my own body.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (6,5), with its body at (5,5). So, it's to the left and a bit down from me.\n\nIf I go to (7,7), which is left and up from my current position, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving in a way that could intercept me.\n\nPossible moves for the enemy: It could go left, right, up, or down, but I don't know its intentions.\n\nAssuming it's trying to reach the nearest apple as well, perhaps it's going for one of the apples in its vicinity.\n\nBut to play it safe, I should prioritize the apple that minimizes the interaction with the enemy.\n\nGiven that, going to (7,7) seems okay because it's away from the enemy's current position.\n\nAfter eating (7,7), I would grow, so my tail would extend. Then, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's say I eat (7,7), then head to (6,4). From (7,7), the distance to (6,4) is |7-6| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (7,1), which is |7-7| + |7-1| = 0 + 6 = 6.\n\nSo, (6,4) is closer.\n\nBut, I need to consider the path.\n\nFrom (7,7) to (6,4):\n\n- Left to (6,7)\n\n- Down to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\nThat's 1 left and 3 downs, total 4 moves.\n\nBut, (6,5) is where the enemy is currently at. I need to make sure that by the time I get there, the enemy has moved away.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (7,1) after (7,7).\n\nFrom (7,7) to (7,1):\n\n- Down 6 times.\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nComparing to going to (6,4), which is 4 moves, versus 6 moves to (7,1).\n\nSo, (6,4) is faster.\n\nBut, considering the enemy is at (6,5), which is on the path to (6,4), I need to be cautious.\n\nPerhaps I should consider going for (5,5) after (6,4), but wait, (5,5) isn't an apple. Oh, perhaps I was thinking of (5,5) as part of the path, but it's not an apple.\n\nWait, the apples are at (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), and (7,7). So, no (5,5).\n\nI need to plan my path carefully.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider which apples are in clusters, so I can eat multiple apples in one go without traveling too far.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (7,1)\n\n- (7,7)\n\nSo, (7,7) and (7,1) are in the same column, 6 rows apart.\n\n(6,4), (1,3), and (3,1) are spread out.\n\nPerhaps I can go for (7,7), then (7,1), then (6,4), then the others.\n\nBut that seems inefficient because (7,7) to (7,1) is a long path, 6 moves down.\n\nAlternatively, (7,7) to (6,4) is shorter, only 4 moves.\n\nI think the better strategy is to go for the closer apples first, minimizing the total movement.\n\nSo, starting from (8,6):\n\n1. Go to (7,7) to eat the apple (2 moves: left twice).\n\n2. Then go to (6,4) (4 moves: left once, then down three times).\n\nTotal: 6 moves.\n\nThen, from (6,4), I can look for the next closest apple.\n\nAt (6,4), the closest apples would be (1,3) at |6-1| + |4-3| = 5 + 1 = 6, and (3,1) at |6-3| + |4-1| = 3 + 3 = 6, and (7,1) at |6-7| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, (7,1) is closest from there, at 4 moves.\n\nThen, from (7,1), to (1,3): |7-1| + |1-3| = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, from (7,1), to (3,1): |7-3| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4.\n\nSo, going from (7,1) to (3,1) is 4 moves left.\n\nThen, from (3,1) to (1,3): |3-1| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nTotal moves: 2 (to 7,7) + 4 (to 6,4) + 4 (to 7,1) + 4 (to 3,1) + 4 (to 1,3) = 18 moves.\n\nAlternatively, another order:\n\n(7,7) -> (7,1) -> (6,4) -> (3,1) -> (1,3).\n\nFrom (7,7) to (7,1): 6 down.\n\nFrom (7,1) to (6,4): up three and left three: total 6 moves.\n\nFrom (6,4) to (3,1): left three and down three: 6 moves.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (1,3): left two and up two: 4 moves.\n\nTotal: 2 (to 7,7) + 6 (to 7,1) + 6 (to 6,4) + 6 (to 3,1) + 4 (to 1,3) = 24 moves.\n\nWait, that's worse than the previous plan.\n\nSo, the first plan seems better: 18 moves.\n\nBut I need to consider time"

A . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, '2' is at row 6, column 8, which is (8,6). But earlier it was mentioned as (8,7). Maybe there's a mistake in the initial position. I'll go with the board state, so I'm at (8,6).\n\nWait, but in the board, row 7 is y=7, row 6 is y=6, etc., with row 0 being y=0. So, '2' is at row 6, column 8, which is (8,6). But in the initial info, it says (8,7). Hmm, perhaps there's confusion between row and column. Let's make sure.\n\nCoordinates are (x,y), with x increasing to the right, y increasing upwards. So, bottom left is (0,0), top right is (9,9).\n\nGiven that, '2' is at (8,6), as per the board.\n\nOkay, moving on.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (7,1)\n\n- (7,7)\n\nEnemy snake ID 1 is at (7,5), with body at (6,5).\n\nSo, enemy head is at (7,5), body at (6,5).\n\nI need to plan my path to eat apples without hitting walls, enemy snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (8,6) to each apple:\n\n- To (6,4): |8-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (1,3): |8-1| + |6-3| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\n- To (3,1): |8-3| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- To (7,1): |8-7| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- To (7,7): |8-7| + |6-7| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,7) with a distance of 2, followed by (6,4) at distance 4, then (7,1) at 6, and the others at 10.\n\nI should probably go for the closest apple first, which is (7,7), to minimize the time and risk.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy's position and possible movements.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,5), with its body at (6,5). So, it's below (7,5), meaning it was previously at (6,5) and moved to (7,5).\n\nI need to predict where it might go next.\n\nAssuming the enemy is also trying to eat apples, it might go for the apple at (6,4), which is relatively close to it.\n\nFrom (7,5), the distance to (6,4) is |7-6| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nDistance to other apples:\n\n- (1,3): |7-1| + |5-3| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (3,1): |7-3| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (7,1): |7-7| + |5-1| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\n- (7,7): |7-7| + |5-7| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\nSo, the enemy has two apples at distance 2: (6,4) and (7,7). It might choose one based on direction or random choice.\n\nIf the enemy goes for (6,4), it would need to move left to (6,5), then down to (6,4).\n\nIf it goes for (7,7), it would need to move up to (7,6), then up to (7,7).\n\nI need to consider these possibilities and plan my path accordingly.\n\nLet's consider my path to (7,7):\n\nFrom (8,6), I can move left to (7,6), then up to (7,7).\n\nThat's two moves.\n\nDuring this time, the enemy is at (7,5). If it decides to go to (7,7), it would need to move up to (7,6), then up to (7,7).\n\nSo, if I move left to (7,6), and the enemy moves up to (7,6) as well, we would both be at (7,6) in the next move, resulting in a collision and both of us dying.\n\nThat's not good.\n\nAlternatively, if the enemy goes for (6,4), moving left to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then I can safely go to (7,7).\n\nBut I can't be sure about the enemy's intentions.\n\nTo minimize risk, perhaps I should choose a different path or target.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (6,4), which is closer to me than the enemy.\n\nWait, no. The apple at (6,4) is closer to the enemy than to me.\n\nWait, no. From my position (8,6), distance to (6,4) is 4, from enemy's position (7,5) to (6,4) is 2.\n\nSo, it's closer to the enemy.\n\nIf I go for (6,4), the enemy might intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (7,1), which is at (7,1). Distance from me is 5 down and 1 left, total 6 moves.\n\nFrom the enemy's position (7,5) to (7,1) is 4 down, which is 4 moves.\n\nSo, I would take 6 moves, enemy would take 4 moves, so it's still possible for the enemy to get there first.\n\nNot ideal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for (7,7), but find a way to avoid the enemy.\n\nIf I move left to (7,6), and the enemy moves up to (7,6), we collide.\n\nBut if I move up to (8,7), then left to (7,7), that might work.\n\nWait, from (8,6), up to (8,7), then left to (7,7).\n\nIn the first move, I go up to (8,7). The enemy could move up to (7,6).\n\nIn the second move, I go left to (7,7), and the enemy moves up to (7,7), causing a collision.\n\nStill a problem.\n\nAlternatively, if I go left to (7,6), and the enemy moves somewhere else, maybe down to (7,4).\n\nThen, in the next move, I can go up to (7,7) safely.\n\nBut I can't predict the enemy's moves.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for a different apple that's farther away but less contested.\n\nLike (1,3) or (3,1), which are both at distance 10 from me and 8 from the enemy.\n\nBut that would take too much time, and I might starve or get caught by the enemy on the way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to maneuver in a way that forces the enemy into a bad position.\n\nFor example, if I can box the enemy in or force it to make moves that leave it vulnerable.\n\nBut that seems complicated for now.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the potential paths and see which one has the least risk.\n\nLet's think about going to (7,7):\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move left to (7,6)\n\n- Move up to (7,7)\n\nRisk: Enemy moves up to (7,6), then up to (7,7), leading to collision."

            "rationale": "Alright, I need to make a decision on which direction to move in this snake game. Let's recap the situation.\n\nMy snake is at position (8,6), which is on the board at row 6, column 8. There are multiple apples on the board: at (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), and (7,7). There's also an enemy snake at (7,5) with its body at (6,5).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. Looking at the distances, the closest apple is at (7,7), which is just two moves away: left to (7,6) and then up to (7,7). However, the enemy is at (7,5), and it can also reach (7,7) by moving up to (7,6) and then to (7,7). So, there's a risk of collision if we both try to eat the same apple.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (6,4), which is farther away, but the enemy is closer to it. If I go for (6,4), the enemy might intercept me before I can reach it.\n\nThe other apples are even farther away, so they're not practical options right now.\n\nI need to think of a way to get to (7,7) without colliding with the enemy. Maybe I can find a path that allows me to reach it before the enemy does.\n\nLet's consider my possible moves:\n\n1. Move left to (7,6), then up to (7,7).\n\n   - Risk: Enemy moves up to (7,6), then to (7,7), leading to a collision.\n\n2. Move up to (8,7), then left to (7,7).\n\n   - Risk: Enemy moves up to (7,6), then to (7,7), again leading to a collision.\n\n3. Try to maneuver around the enemy.\n\n   - For example, move up to (8,7), then right to (9,7), and circle around.\n\n     - Problem: This would take more moves, and the enemy can reach (7,7) faster.\n\n4. Target a different apple.\n\n   - For instance, go for (7,1), which is farther away, but the enemy can also reach it sooner.\n\nHmm, none of these options seem ideal. The closest apple is (7,7), but it's also attractive to the enemy. Going for farther apples wouldn't be efficient, as the enemy can reach them faster or intercept me.\n\nMaybe I need to consider provoking the enemy into making a mistake. If I can position myself in a way that threatens the enemy, it might make a wrong move and die, allowing me to take over the board.\n\nFor example, if I can cut off the enemy's escape routes or box it in, I might be able to eliminate it and then go for the apples without competition.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (7,5) with its body at (6,5). If I can occupy positions that block its movement, perhaps I can force it into a deadly collision.\n\nBut right now, I'm at (8,6), and the enemy is at (7,5). If I move left to (7,6), I'm getting closer to the enemy, which might encourage it to back off or make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (8,7), I'm still in proximity to the enemy, but not directly threatening its current position.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should consider the possible moves of the enemy.\n\nIf the enemy decides to go for (7,7), it would need to move up to (7,6), then up to (7,7).\n\nIf I move left to (7,6) first, the enemy might be forced to choose between continuing to (7,7) or doing something else.\n\nBut as both of us would be at (7,6) in the next move, leading to a collision.\n\nThat's not good.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (8,7), the enemy might move up to (7,6), and then in the next move, I move left to (7,7), while the enemy moves to (7,7), again causing a collision.\n\nIt seems like no matter what I do, if both snakes target (7,7), there's a high risk of collision.\n\nMaybe I should try to signal to the enemy that I'm going for (7,7), hoping it chooses a different apple.\n\nBut snakes don't communicate, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can make a feint move, like moving up to (8,7), making the enemy think I'm going for (8,8) or somewhere else, and then switch direction to go for (7,7).\n\nBut again, the enemy might not fall for it, and I could end up in a worse position.\n\nThis is tricky. I need to make a decision based on the current information.\n\nLet me consider the potential outcomes of each possible move:\n\n1. Move left to (7,6):\n\n   - If the enemy moves up to (7,6), collision.\n\n   - If the enemy moves elsewhere, I can then move up to (7,7) safely.\n\n2. Move up to (8,7):\n\n   - If the enemy moves up to (7,6), then in my next move, moving left to (7,7) would cause a collision.\n\n   - If the enemy moves differently, I can then proceed to (7,7).\n\n3. Move right to (9,6):\n\n   - This moves me away from the apple at (7,7), which is not desirable.\n\n   - It also doesn't threaten the enemy's position.\n\n4. Move down to (8,5):\n\n   - This would bring me closer to the enemy, possibly encouraging it to move away.\n\n   - However, there's an apple at (7,1) that's farther away, and the enemy might go for it.\n\nBut again, going down seems suboptimal when the closest apple is up and to the left.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the long-term strategy. If I can eliminate the enemy, I can safely eat all the apples without competition.\n\nTo eliminate the enemy, I need to force it into a position where it collides with me, the wall, or itself.\n\nFor example, if I can block its possible moves, it has no choice but to die.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (7,5) with its body at (6,5). If I can occupy (7,5) or (6,5), I can potentially cut off its movement.\n\nBut if I move to (7,5), that's the enemy's current position, which would cause a collision and kill both of us.\n\nI need a way to force the enemy into a position where it has no good moves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can grow longer by eating apples, making it harder for the enemy to catch up to me.\n\nBut with only one move to make right now, I need to decide on the immediate action.\n\nGiven the options, moving left to (7,6) seems like the most direct path to the closest apple at (7,7).\n\nHowever, it also puts me in direct conflict with the enemy, who can also reach (7,7) quickly.\n\nPerhaps the safer option is to go for a different apple, even if it's farther away.\n\nBut as mentioned earlier, the other apples are too far, and the enemy can reach them faster or intercept me.\n\nThis is a tough spot. I need to balance between getting the closest apple and avoiding the enemy.\n\nMaybe I should accept some risk and go for (7,7), accepting that there's a chance I might die, but also a chance I might get the apple without collision.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to maneuver in a way that makes it harder for the enemy to follow me.\n\nFor example, if I move left to (7,6), and then up to (7,7), the enemy would need to move up to (7,6), then to (7,7), which is the same path.\n\nBut if I can somehow vary my path, perhaps the enemy will make a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I can move up to (8,7), then left to (7,7), while the enemy moves up to (7,6), then to (7,7), resulting in a collision.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left to (7,6), and then up to (7,7), again leading to a collision.\n\nIt seems unavoidable.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that dying isn't the end of the world in this game. If I die, I can respawn and try again.\n\nBut the goal is to have the most points by the end, so dying is suboptimal.\n\nGiven that, I should try to minimize the risk of dying while maximizing the chances of eating apples.\n\nIn this scenario, going for (7,7) seems too risky due to the enemy's proximity and the likelihood of collision.\n\nPerhaps I should consider going for (6,4), even though it's farther away.\n\nFrom my current position at (8,6), moving left to (7,6), then up to (7,5), then left to (6,5), then up to (6,4) would allow me to eat the apple at (6,4).\n\nThat's four moves, during which the enemy could potentially reach (6,4) as well, but it's currently at (7,5), and moving to (6,4) would require moving left to (6,5), then down to (6,4).\n\nSo, it's two moves for the enemy, compared to my four moves.\n\nBut"

            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is at position (9,7), which is in the bottom part of the grid, towards the right. There are apples at (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), and (5,5). There's also an enemy snake at (4,5), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head for now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are upwards, and higher X coordinates are to the right.\n\nMy position is (9,7), which is towards the bottom-right. The apples are scattered around the grid: one at (6,4), which is a bit to the upper-left; one at (1,3), which is near the left side, not too high; (3,1), which is lower down on the left; (7,1), which is lower down on the right; and (5,5), which is more in the center.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. I should consider the distance to each apple and also consider the position of the enemy snake. The enemy is at (4,5), so it's in the middle-left area.\n\nLet me calculate the Manhattan distances from my position to each apple:\n\n- To (6,4): |9-6| + |7-4| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- To (1,3): |9-1| + |7-3| = 8 + 4 = 12\n\n- To (3,1): |9-3| + |7-1| = 6 + 6 = 12\n\n- To (7,1): |9-7| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- To (5,5): |9-5| + |7-5| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\nSo, the closest apples are at (6,4) and (5,5), both with a distance of 6. The apple at (7,1) is a bit farther at 8, and the others are even farther at 12.\n\nI should probably go for one of the closer apples first. Let's see which path would be safer.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\n- From (9,7), moving up towards (5,5) would involve going up to (9,8), then (9,9), then left to (8,9), etc. But I need to see if there are any obstacles or the enemy in that path.\n\n- Moving to (6,4) would involve going up to (9,8), (9,9), then left to (8,9), (7,9), and so on down to (6,4).\n\nWait, actually, to get to (6,4), going up to (9,9), then left to (6,9), then down to (6,4) would be a longer path. Maybe there's a shorter way.\n\nAlternatively, I could try moving left towards (6,7), then up to (6,4). Let's calculate that:\n\n- From (9,7) to (6,7): move left 3 steps.\n\n- From (6,7) to (6,4): move down 3 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 6, which matches the Manhattan distance.\n\nSimilarly, to (5,5):\n\n- From (9,7) to (5,7): left 4 steps.\n\n- From (5,7) to (5,5): down 2 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 6.\n\nSo both paths are equally long. Now, I need to consider the enemy's position.\n\nThe enemy is at (4,5). If I go to (5,5), I'll be close to the enemy. Maybe I should avoid that initially.\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (6,4), which is a bit further away from the enemy, that might be safer.\n\nAlso, considering the other apples, if I go for (6,4), I can potentially set myself up for another apple afterward.\n\nLet me think about the sequence:\n\n1. Go to (6,4).\n\n- Path: left 3 to (6,7), then down 3 to (6,4).\n\n- That's 6 steps.\n\n2. After eating (6,4), I can look for the next apple.\n\n- The next closest might be (5,5), which is now at a distance of |6-5| + |4-5| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\n- So, from (6,4), move left to (5,4), then up to (5,5).\n\n- Total steps: 2.\n\n- Then, maybe go for (7,1), which is |5-7| + |5-1| = 2 + 4 = 6.\n\n- Path: right 2 to (7,5), then down 4 to (7,1).\n\n- Total steps: 6.\n\n- Then, maybe go for (1,3) or (3,1), whichever is closer.\n\nThis seems like a possible sequence: (6,4) -> (5,5) -> (7,1) -> (1,3) or (3,1).\n\nAlternatively, another sequence could be:\n\n1. Go to (5,5).\n\n- Path: left 4 to (5,7), then down 2 to (5,5).\n\n- Total steps: 6.\n\n2. Then go to (6,4): right 1, down 1. Steps: 2.\n\n3. Then (7,1): right 1, down 3. Steps: 4.\n\n4. Then (1,3): left 6, up 2. Steps: 8.\n\nThis seems longer than the first sequence.\n\nSo, perhaps the first sequence is better: go to (6,4), then (5,5), then (7,1), then another apple.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider the enemy's movement as well. If the enemy is at (4,5), and I'm going to (5,5), that might put me in its way.\n\nI should try to stay away from the enemy as much as possible, especially since it could be growing as well.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that my path doesn't lead me into a corner where I can't turn back without hitting myself or a wall.\n\nGiven that, maybe I should aim for (7,1) directly from (9,7).\n\nPath to (7,1):\n\n- Left 2 to (7,7), then down 6 to (7,1). Total steps: 8.\n\nBut that's longer than going to (6,4) or (5,5), which are 6 steps away.\n\nAlso, after eating (7,1), the next closest apple would be (1,3) or (3,1), both at a distance of |7-1| + |1-3| = 6 + 2 = 8, or |7-3| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4.\n\nSo, (3,1) is closer after eating (7,1).\n\nSequence:\n\n1. (9,7) to (7,1): left 2, down 6. Steps: 8.\n\n2. Then (3,1): left 4, up 0. Steps: 4.\n\n3. Then (1,3): left 2, up 2. Steps: 4.\n\n4. Then (6,4): right 5, up 1. Steps: 6.\n\nTotal steps: 8 + 4 + 4 + 6 = 22.\n\nCompare to the first sequence:\n\n1. (9,7) to (6,4): left 3, down 3. Steps: 6.\n\n2. Then (5,5): left 1, up 1. Steps: 2.\n\n3. Then (7,1): right 2, down 4. Steps: 6.\n\n4. Then (1,3): left 6, up 2. Steps: 8.\n\nTotal steps: 6 + 2 + 6 + 8 = 22.\n\nSo, both sequences take the same total steps, but the first sequence gets me to apples faster, potentially allowing me to grow sooner and have more options.\n\nAlso, considering that the enemy is at (4,5), going to (6,4) might be safer than going to (5,5), which is closer to the enemy.\n\nTherefore, maybe the best initial move is to go left towards (6,7).\n\nFrom there, I can assess the situation better and decide whether to go down to (6,4) or elsewhere.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that moving left from (9,7) is safe. Is there any part of my body there? According to the last move information, direction is none, rationale is none, which suggests that this is either the starting position or the snake hasn't moved yet.\n\nAssuming it's the starting position, my body is only at (9,7), so moving left to (8,7) is safe, as long as there are no other snakes or walls there.\n\nLooking at the board, (8,7) is empty. So, moving left is safe.\n\nAfter"

            "rationale": "Alright, I'm trying to figure out my next move in this snake game. So, first things first, I need to understand where I am and where everything else is.\n\nI'm currently at position (9,7), which is towards the bottom-right of the board. The apples are at (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), and (7,7). There's also an enemy snake at (4,5) with its body at (4,5), but it seems like it's just the head for now.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. There are a few factors to consider here:\n\n1. **Distance to the apple**: I should probably go for the closest one to minimize the time and moves needed.\n\n2. **Safety**: I need to make sure that the path to the apple doesn't lead me into the enemy's territory or into a trap where I might collide with my own body or the wall.\n\n3. **Future planning**: After eating one apple, I should think about which apple to go for next in a way that optimizes my path and avoids unnecessary backtracking.\n\nLet's start by calculating the Manhattan distances from my current position to each apple:\n\n- To (6,4): |9-6| + |7-4| = 3 + 3 = 6\n\n- To (1,3): |9-1| + |7-3| = 8 + 4 = 12\n\n- To (3,1): |9-3| + |7-1| = 6 + 6 = 12\n\n- To (7,1): |9-7| + |7-1| = 2 + 6 = 8\n\n- To (7,7): |9-7| + |7-7| = 2 + 0 = 2\n\nWait a minute, there's an apple at (7,7), which is very close to my current position at (9,7). The distance is only 2 steps to the left. That seems like the closest apple.\n\nBut looking back at the board state you provided:\n\n```\n\n9 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n8 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n7 . . . . . . . A 2 .\n\n6 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n5 . . . . T 1 . . . .\n\n4 . . . . . . A . . .\n\n3 . A . . . . . . . .\n\n2 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n1 . . . A . . . A . .\n\n0 . . . . . . . . . .\n\n  0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\n```\n\nFrom this, it seems like there's an apple at (7,7), which is position 'A' in the grid, and I'm at (9,7), which is position '2'. So, yes, moving left twice would take me to the apple at (7,7).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left is safe. According to the board, position (8,7) and (7,7) are both empty, so moving left twice should be fine.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (7,7), I would grow, so I need to make sure that I have a path to the next apple without running into myself or the enemy.\n\nLet's think about the next apple to go for after (7,7). The closest ones would be (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), or (5,5). But since I'll be at (7,7), let's recalculate the distances:\n\n- To (6,4): |7-6| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4\n\n- To (1,3): |7-1| + |7-3| = 6 + 4 = 10\n\n- To (3,1): |7-3| + |7-1| = 4 + 6 = 10\n\n- To (7,1): |7-7| + |7-1| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- To (5,5): |7-5| + |7-5| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\nSo, the closest apples are now (6,4) and (5,5), both at a distance of 4.\n\nLooking at the enemy's position at (4,5), which is towards the middle-left. If I go to (5,5), I'll be getting closer to the enemy, which might not be ideal. So, maybe I should consider going for (6,4) first.\n\nLet's plan a path from (7,7) to (6,4):\n\n- Left to (6,7), then down to (6,4): that's 1 left + 3 down = 4 steps.\n\nAlternatively, to (5,5):\n\n- Left to (5,7), then down to (5,5): 2 left + 2 down = 4 steps.\n\nSo, both paths are equally long. But since (6,4) is slightly away from the enemy, I'll prefer that.\n\nAfter eating (6,4), the next apple to go for would be (5,5), which is now closer, or maybe (7,1), depending on the board state.\n\nBut let's not get too ahead. First, I need to make sure I can safely get to (7,7) and then to (6,4).\n\nWait a second, looking back at the board, there's an apple at (7,7), but there's also my position '2' there. Does that mean I'm already at (7,7)? Wait, no, the board shows 'A' at (7,7) and '2' at (9,7). So, I'm at (9,7), and the apple is at (7,7).\n\nOkay, so moving left twice will take me to (7,7), where the apple is.\n\nBut I need to make sure that after eating the apple, my body extends, and I don't collide with it. Since I'm moving left, my tail will be at (9,7), and my head will be at (7,7). So, my body will be at (8,7) and (7,7).\n\nThen, next move, I need to continue moving without hitting my own body. So, from (7,7), I can move to (6,7), then down to (6,6), and so on, towards (6,4).\n\nBut wait, I need to think about the enemy's possible moves as well. The enemy is at (4,5), and it could be moving in any direction. I need to anticipate its movement and avoid collisions.\n\nHowever, since I don't have information about the enemy's velocity or its intended path, I'll have to make some assumptions. Probably, the enemy is trying to reach the closest apple as well.\n\nGiven that, I should try to minimize the time I'm exposed to the enemy. So, if I go for (7,7) and then (6,4), I'm moving left and down, away from the enemy, which is at (4,5).\n\nAlternatively, if I go for (5,5), I'm moving left and up, closer to the enemy.\n\nTherefore, going for (6,4) first seems like a better idea in terms of safety.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Move left to (8,7)\n\n2. Move left to (7,7) to eat the apple\n\n3. Move left to (6,7)\n\n4. Move down to (6,6)\n\n5. Move down to (6,5)\n\n6. Move down to (6,4) to eat the next apple\n\nThen, assess the situation again.\n\nBut, I need to make sure that moving down from (6,7) to (6,4) is safe. I should check if there are any obstacles or the enemy in that path.\n\nLooking at the board, between (6,7) and (6,4), there are positions (6,6), (6,5), and (6,4). From the board, position (6,4) has an apple, and the rest seem empty.\n\nBut I need to consider if the enemy might reach that area before me.\n\nGiven that, I should try to move quickly to (7,7) and then to (6,4), minimizing the time the enemy can intercept me.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for a different apple that's less exposed.\n\nLet me consider going for (7,1) instead of (6,4). The path would be:\n\n- From (9,7), move left to (7,7), then down to (7,1).\n\nThat's 2 left + 6 down = 8 steps.\n\nComparing to the previous path to (6,4), which is 3 left + 3 down = 6 steps.\n\nSo, going to (6,4) is faster.\n\nBut, after eating (6,4), I need to go to another apple. Let's say I go to (5,5): 1 left + 1 down = 2 steps.\n\nThen, to (7,1): 2 right + 4 down = 6 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 6 (to 6,4) + 2 (to 5,5) + 6 (to 7,1) = 14"

That means y increases as we go up, which is a bit counterintuitive, but I need to keep that in mind.\n\nMy snake is ID 2, and I'm currently at position (8,6).

There are multiple apples, and I need to maximize my score by eating as many as possible without dying.\n\nFirst, I should consider the distance to each apple from my current position. Since the board uses Manhattan distance (given the way movement is described), I'll calculate the distances accordingly.\n\nFrom (8,6):\n\n- To (6,4): |8-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (1,3): |8-1| + |6-3| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\n- To (3,1): |8-3| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- To (7,1): |8-7| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- To (7,7): |8-7| + |6-7| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,7) with a distance of 2, followed by (6,4) at distance 4, and then (7,1) at 6, and the others are farther.\n\nBut, I need to consider not just the distance but also the safety of the path to each apple. I have to make sure that I don't run into the enemy snake or into my own body.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (6,5), with its body at (5,5). So, it's to the left and a bit down from me.\n\nIf I go to (7,7), which is left and up from my current position, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't moving in a way that could intercept me.\n\nPossible moves for the enemy: It could go left, right, up, or down, but I don't know its intentions.\n\nAssuming it's trying to reach the nearest apple as well, perhaps it's going for one of the apples in its vicinity.\n\nBut to play it safe, I should prioritize the apple that minimizes the interaction with the enemy.\n\nGiven that, going to (7,7) seems okay because it's away from the enemy's current position.\n\nAfter eating (7,7), I would grow, so my tail would extend. Then, I need to decide which apple to go for next.\n\nLet's say I eat (7,7), then head to (6,4). From (7,7), the distance to (6,4) is |7-6| + |7-4| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nAlternatively, I could go for (7,1), which is |7-7| + |7-1| = 0 + 6 = 6.\n\nSo, (6,4) is closer.\n\nBut, I need to consider the path.\n\nFrom (7,7) to (6,4):\n\n- Left to (6,7)\n\n- Down to (6,6)\n\n- Down to (6,5)\n\n- Down to (6,4)\n\nThat's 1 left and 3 downs, total 4 moves.\n\nBut, (6,5) is where the enemy is currently at. I need to make sure that by the time I get there, the enemy has moved away.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should consider going for (7,1) after (7,7).\n\nFrom (7,7) to (7,1):\n\n- Down 6 times.\n\nThat's 6 moves.\n\nComparing to going to (6,4), which is 4 moves, versus 6 moves to (7,1).\n\nSo, (6,4) is faster.\n\nBut, considering the enemy is at (6,5), which is on the path to (6,4), I need to be cautious.\n\nPerhaps I should consider going for (5,5) after (6,4), but wait, (5,5) isn't an apple. Oh, perhaps I was thinking of (5,5) as part of the path, but it's not an apple.\n\nWait, the apples are at (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), and (7,7). So, no (5,5).\n\nI need to plan my path carefully.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider which apples are in clusters, so I can eat multiple apples in one go without traveling too far.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (7,1)\n\n- (7,7)\n\nSo, (7,7) and (7,1) are in the same column, 6 rows apart.\n\n(6,4), (1,3), and (3,1) are spread out.\n\nPerhaps I can go for (7,7), then (7,1), then (6,4), then the others.\n\nBut that seems inefficient because (7,7) to (7,1) is a long path, 6 moves down.\n\nAlternatively, (7,7) to (6,4) is shorter, only 4 moves.\n\nI think the better strategy is to go for the closer apples first, minimizing the total movement.\n\nSo, starting from (8,6):\n\n1. Go to (7,7) to eat the apple (2 moves: left twice).\n\n2. Then go to (6,4) (4 moves: left once, then down three times).\n\nTotal: 6 moves.\n\nThen, from (6,4), I can look for the next closest apple.\n\nAt (6,4), the closest apples would be (1,3) at |6-1| + |4-3| = 5 + 1 = 6, and (3,1) at |6-3| + |4-1| = 3 + 3 = 6, and (7,1) at |6-7| + |4-1| = 1 + 3 = 4.\n\nSo, (7,1) is closest from there, at 4 moves.\n\nThen, from (7,1), to (1,3): |7-1| + |1-3| = 6 + 2 = 8.\n\nAlternatively, from (7,1), to (3,1): |7-3| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4.\n\nSo, going from (7,1) to (3,1) is 4 moves left.\n\nThen, from (3,1) to (1,3): |3-1| + |1-3| = 2 + 2 = 4.\n\nTotal moves: 2 (to 7,7) + 4 (to 6,4) + 4 (to 7,1) + 4 (to 3,1) + 4 (to 1,3) = 18 moves.\n\nAlternatively, another order:\n\n(7,7) -> (7,1) -> (6,4) -> (3,1) -> (1,3).\n\nFrom (7,7) to (7,1): 6 down.\n\nFrom (7,1) to (6,4): up three and left three: total 6 moves.\n\nFrom (6,4) to (3,1): left three and down three: 6 moves.\n\nFrom (3,1) to (1,3): left two and up two: 4 moves.\n\nTotal: 2 (to 7,7) + 6 (to 7,1) + 6 (to 6,4) + 6 (to 3,1) + 4 (to 1,3) = 24 moves.\n\nWait, that's worse than the previous plan.\n\nSo, the first plan seems better: 18 moves.\n\nBut I need to consider time"

Wait, in the board state you provided, it shows '2' at (8,6), but in the initial information, it says I'm at (8,7). There's a discrepancy here. Let's clarify that.\n\nLooking at the board:\n\nRow 9: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: . . . . . . . A . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . .

Maybe there's a mistake in the initial position. I'll go with the board state, so I'm at (8,6).\n\nWait, but in the board, row 7 is y=7, row 6 is y=6, etc., with row 0 being y=0. So, '2' is at row 6, column 8, which is (8,6). But in the initial info, it says (8,7). Hmm, perhaps there's confusion between row and column. Let's make sure.\n\nCoordinates are (x,y), with x increasing to the right, y increasing upwards. So, bottom left is (0,0), top right is (9,9).\n\nGiven that, '2' is at (8,6), as per the board.\n\nOkay, moving on.\n\nApples are at:\n\n- (6,4)\n\n- (1,3)\n\n- (3,1)\n\n- (7,1)\n\n- (7,7)\n\nEnemy snake ID 1 is at (7,5), with body at (6,5).\n\nSo, enemy head is at (7,5), body at (6,5).\n\nI need to plan my path to eat apples without hitting walls, enemy snakes, or myself.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple to go for first. There are multiple apples, and I need to prioritize based on proximity and safety.\n\nLet's calculate the Manhattan distances from my current position (8,6) to each apple:\n\n- To (6,4): |8-6| + |6-4| = 2 + 2 = 4\n\n- To (1,3): |8-1| + |6-3| = 7 + 3 = 10\n\n- To (3,1): |8-3| + |6-1| = 5 + 5 = 10\n\n- To (7,1): |8-7| + |6-1| = 1 + 5 = 6\n\n- To (7,7): |8-7| + |6-7| = 1 + 1 = 2\n\nSo, the closest apple is at (7,7) with a distance of 2, followed by (6,4) at distance 4, then (7,1) at 6, and the others at 10.\n\nI should probably go for the closest apple first, which is (7,7), to minimize the time and risk.\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy's position and possible movements.\n\nThe enemy is at (7,5), with its body at (6,5). So, it's below (7,5), meaning it was previously at (6,5) and moved to (7,5).\n\nI need to predict where it might go next.\n\nAssuming the enemy is also trying to eat apples, it might go for the apple at (6,4), which is relatively close to it.\n\nFrom (7,5), the distance to (6,4) is |7-6| + |5-4| = 1 + 1 = 2.\n\nDistance to other apples:\n\n- (1,3): |7-1| + |5-3| = 6 + 2 = 8\n\n- (3,1): |7-3| + |5-1| = 4 + 4 = 8\n\n- (7,1): |7-7| + |5-1| = 0 + 4 = 4\n\n- (7,7): |7-7| + |5-7| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\nSo, the enemy has two apples at distance 2: (6,4) and (7,7). It might choose one based on direction or random choice.\n\nIf the enemy goes for (6,4), it would need to move left to (6,5), then down to (6,4).\n\nIf it goes for (7,7), it would need to move up to (7,6), then up to (7,7).\n\nI need to consider these possibilities and plan my path accordingly.\n\nLet's consider my path to (7,7):\n\nFrom (8,6), I can move left to (7,6), then up to (7,7).\n\nThat's two moves.\n\nDuring this time, the enemy is at (7,5). If it decides to go to (7,7), it would need to move up to (7,6), then up to (7,7).\n\nSo, if I move left to (7,6), and the enemy moves up to (7,6) as well, we would both be at (7,6) in the next move, resulting in a collision and both of us dying.\n\nThat's not good.\n\nAlternatively, if the enemy goes for (6,4), moving left to (6,5), then down to (6,4), then I can safely go to (7,7).\n\nBut I can't be sure about the enemy's intentions.\n\nTo minimize risk, perhaps I should choose a different path or target.\n\nAnother option is to go for the apple at (6,4), which is closer to me than the enemy.\n\nWait, no. The apple at (6,4) is closer to the enemy than to me.\n\nWait, no.

Distance from me is 5 down and 1 left, total 6 moves.\n\nFrom the enemy's position (7,5) to (7,1) is 4 down, which is 4 moves.\n\nSo, I would take 6 moves, enemy would take 4 moves, so it's still possible for the enemy to get there first.\n\nNot ideal.\n\nWait, perhaps I should consider going for (7,7), but find a way to avoid the enemy.\n\nIf I move left to (7,6), and the enemy moves up to (7,6), we collide.\n\nBut if I move up to (8,7), then left to (7,7), that might work.\n\nWait, from (8,6), up to (8,7), then left to (7,7).\n\nIn the first move, I go up to (8,7). The enemy could move up to (7,6).\n\nIn the second move, I go left to (7,7), and the enemy moves up to (7,7), causing a collision.\n\nStill a problem.\n\nAlternatively, if I go left to (7,6), and the enemy moves somewhere else, maybe down to (7,4).\n\nThen, in the next move, I can go up to (7,7) safely.\n\nBut I can't predict the enemy's moves.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for a different apple that's farther away but less contested.\n\nLike (1,3) or (3,1), which are both at distance 10 from me and 8 from the enemy.\n\nBut that would take too much time, and I might starve or get caught by the enemy on the way.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can try to maneuver in a way that forces the enemy into a bad position.\n\nFor example, if I can box the enemy in or force it to make moves that leave it vulnerable.\n\nBut that seems complicated for now.\n\nAnother approach is to consider the potential paths and see which one has the least risk.\n\nLet's think about going to (7,7):\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Move left to (7,6)\n\n- Move up to (7,7)\n\nRisk: Enemy moves up to (7,6), then up to (7,7), leading to collision."

Let's recap the situation.\n\nMy snake is at position (8,6), which is on the board at row 6, column 8. There are multiple apples on the board: at (6,4), (1,3), (3,1), (7,1), and (7,7). There's also an enemy snake at (7,5) with its body at (6,5).\n\nFirst, I need to prioritize which apple to go for. Looking at the distances, the closest apple is at (7,7), which is just two moves away: left to (7,6) and then up to (7,7). However, the enemy is at (7,5), and it can also reach (7,7) by moving up to (7,6) and then to (7,7). So, there's a risk of collision if we both try to eat the same apple.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (6,4), which is farther away, but the enemy is closer to it. If I go for (6,4), the enemy might intercept me before I can reach it.\n\nThe other apples are even farther away, so they're not practical options right now.\n\nI need to think of a way to get to (7,7) without colliding with the enemy. Maybe I can find a path that allows me to reach it before the enemy does.\n\nLet's consider my possible moves:\n\n1. Move left to (7,6), then up to (7,7).\n\n   - Risk: Enemy moves up to (7,6), then to (7,7), leading to a collision.\n\n2. Move up to (8,7), then left to (7,7).\n\n   - Risk: Enemy moves up to (7,6), then to (7,7), again leading to a collision.\n\n3. Try to maneuver around the enemy.\n\n   - For example, move up to (8,7), then right to (9,7), and circle around.\n\n     - Problem: This would take more moves, and the enemy can reach (7,7) faster.\n\n4. Target a different apple.\n\n   - For instance, go for (7,1), which is farther away, but the enemy can also reach it sooner.\n\nHmm, none of these options seem ideal. The closest apple is (7,7), but it's also attractive to the enemy. Going for farther apples wouldn't be efficient, as the enemy can reach them faster or intercept me.\n\nMaybe I need to consider provoking the enemy into making a mistake. If I can position myself in a way that threatens the enemy, it might make a wrong move and die, allowing me to take over the board.\n\nFor example, if I can cut off the enemy's escape routes or box it in, I might be able to eliminate it and then go for the apples without competition.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (7,5) with its body at (6,5). If I can occupy positions that block its movement, perhaps I can force it into a deadly collision.\n\nBut right now, I'm at (8,6), and the enemy is at (7,5). If I move left to (7,6), I'm getting closer to the enemy, which might encourage it to back off or make a mistake.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (8,7), I'm still in proximity to the enemy, but not directly threatening its current position.\n\nWait a minute, perhaps I should consider the possible moves of the enemy.\n\nIf the enemy decides to go for (7,7), it would need to move up to (7,6), then up to (7,7).\n\nIf I move left to (7,6) first, the enemy might be forced to choose between continuing to (7,7) or doing something else.\n\nBut as both of us would be at (7,6) in the next move, leading to a collision.\n\nThat's not good.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (8,7), the enemy might move up to (7,6), and then in the next move, I move left to (7,7), while the enemy moves to (7,7), again causing a collision.\n\nIt seems like no matter what I do, if both snakes target (7,7), there's a high risk of collision.\n\nMaybe I should try to signal to the enemy that I'm going for (7,7), hoping it chooses a different apple.\n\nBut snakes don't communicate, so that's not possible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can make a feint move, like moving up to (8,7), making the enemy think I'm going for (8,8) or somewhere else, and then switch direction to go for (7,7).\n\nBut again, the enemy might not fall for it, and I could end up in a worse position.\n\nThis is tricky. I need to make a decision based on the current information.\n\nLet me consider the potential outcomes of each possible move:\n\n1. Move left to (7,6):\n\n   - If the enemy moves up to (7,6), collision.\n\n   - If the enemy moves elsewhere, I can then move up to (7,7) safely.\n\n2. Move up to (8,7):\n\n   - If the enemy moves up to (7,6), then in my next move, moving left to (7,7) would cause a collision.\n\n   - If the enemy moves differently, I can then proceed to (7,7).\n\n3. Move right to (9,6):\n\n   - This moves me away from the apple at (7,7), which is not desirable.\n\n   - It also doesn't threaten the enemy's position.\n\n4. Move down to (8,5):\n\n   - This would bring me closer to the enemy, possibly encouraging it to move away.\n\n   - However, there's an apple at (7,1) that's farther away, and the enemy might go for it.\n\nBut again, going down seems suboptimal when the closest apple is up and to the left.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the long-term strategy. If I can eliminate the enemy, I can safely eat all the apples without competition.\n\nTo eliminate the enemy, I need to force it into a position where it collides with me, the wall, or itself.\n\nFor example, if I can block its possible moves, it has no choice but to die.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (7,5) with its body at (6,5). If I can occupy (7,5) or (6,5), I can potentially cut off its movement.\n\nBut if I move to (7,5), that's the enemy's current position, which would cause a collision and kill both of us.\n\nI need a way to force the enemy into a position where it has no good moves.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can grow longer by eating apples, making it harder for the enemy to catch up to me.\n\nBut with only one move to make right now, I need to decide on the immediate action.\n\nGiven the options, moving left to (7,6) seems like the most direct path to the closest apple at (7,7).\n\nHowever, it also puts me in direct conflict with the enemy, who can also reach (7,7) quickly.\n\nPerhaps the safer option is to go for a different apple, even if it's farther away.\n\nBut as mentioned earlier, the other apples are too far, and the enemy can reach them faster or intercept me.\n\nThis is a tough spot. I need to balance between getting the closest apple and avoiding the enemy.\n\nMaybe I should accept some risk and go for (7,7), accepting that there's a chance I might die, but also a chance I might get the apple without collision.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to maneuver in a way that makes it harder for the enemy to follow me.\n\nFor example, if I move left to (7,6), and then up to (7,7), the enemy would need to move up to (7,6), then to (7,7), which is the same path.\n\nBut if I can somehow vary my path, perhaps the enemy will make a mistake.\n\nWait, perhaps I can move up to (8,7), then left to (7,7), while the enemy moves up to (7,6), then to (7,7), resulting in a collision.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left to (7,6), and then up to (7,7), again leading to a collision.\n\nIt seems unavoidable.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that dying isn't the end of the world in this game. If I die, I can respawn and try again.\n\nBut the goal is to have the most points by the end, so dying is suboptimal.\n\nGiven that, I should try to minimize the risk of dying while maximizing the chances of eating apples.\n\nIn this scenario, going for (7,7) seems too risky due to the enemy's proximity and the likelihood of collision.\n\nPerhaps I should consider going for (6,4), even though it's farther away.\n\nFrom my current position at (8,6), moving left to (7,6), then up to (7,5), then left to (6,5), then up to (6,4) would allow me to eat the apple at (6,4).\n\nThat's four moves, during which the enemy could potentially reach (6,4) as well, but it's currently at (7,5), and moving to (6,4) would require moving left to (6,5), then down to (6,4).\n\nSo, it's two moves for the enemy, compared to my four moves.\n\nBut"
