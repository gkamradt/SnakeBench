If I move UP to (6, 4), I can then move UP again to (6, 5), and then LEFT to (5, 5), allowing me to reach the apple at (5, 6) in two moves.\n   - There are no immediate threats from enemy snake #2 since it is located far away at (3, 9).\n\n2. **Possible Moves:**\n   - UP to (6, 4) - This keeps me in the clear and allows for a follow-up move towards (6, 5) for the apple at (5, 6).\n   - DOWN to (6, 2) - This does not help me approach any apples and may leave me vulnerable to future moves.\n   - LEFT to (5, 3) - This moves me closer to the edge of the board, but doesn't bring me closer to any apples.\n   - RIGHT to (7, 3) - This also does not help towards an apple but keeps me safe.\n\nGiven this analysis, moving UP seems to be the best choice as it not only positions me for my next move but also directly connects me to the apple I want.\n\nStrategy next turn: I aim to move towards apples while avoiding unnecessary backward movements or risking positioning near the enemy snake.\n\nDecided next move: UP."

I see that there are apples at (9, 5), (9, 4), (2, 4), (5, 6), and (2, 7). I also see that there's an enemy snake at position (6, 3) with no body yet, so I need to be careful not to run into it.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to try to get closer to one of the apples. I'll start by moving towards the apple at (9, 5), which is the top-right corner of the board. I'll move up to try to get closer to it.\n\nNext move: UP"
