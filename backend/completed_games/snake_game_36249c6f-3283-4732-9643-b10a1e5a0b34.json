It could allow me to push further right in the next turn or potentially move up or down thereafter.\n\n### Strategy Going Forward\n\nAfter moving, I want to keep assessing my position concerning both enemy snakes and the apples on the board. Following the right move to (6, 9), I would keep my focus on apple locations, particularly aiming towards (5, 3) or (4, 2) in future turns. Additionally, I should keep on the lookout for the enemy\u2019s movements and avoid collision with their snake or my own body.\n\nGiven the analysis, I have concluded that the best decision is to move right towards (6, 9) since it maintains flexibility and keeps me aligned with potential apple gains in the next turns.\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT.**"

The only closest apple on the board is at **(1, 5)** but it is far away and requires several moves to reach it. Meanwhile, Snake #1 at (3, 9) with a body at (4, 9) is somewhat far, so I am not in immediate danger. To maximize movement, I should stay away from the enemy snake and try to position myself toward apples while avoiding potential blockages.\n\n#### Possible Next Moves\nSince I can't make productive moves from my current position, I can evaluate which direction offers future opportunities:\n- Moving **UP to (5, 6)** and looking to reconnect to the apple at (4, 6) but it\u2019s not directly accessible right now.\n- Moving **LEFT to (4, 5)** keeps me in a position where I can potentially move toward (4, 6) next turn.\n\nIn conclusion, I see that moving UP to (5, 6) allows me more pathways to explore potential apples while positioning myself away from the snake.\n\nDecided next move: UP"

As mentioned, my snake is positioned at (8, 4). \n\n### Current State Analysis\n- **Apples** are located at:\n  - (0, 0)\n  - (4, 9)\n  - (4, 6)\n  - (1, 5)\n  - (5, 5)\n  \n  My primary target in the upcoming moves is the apple at **(5, 5)**, as it's the closest apple to my current position (8, 4).\n\n- **Enemy Snake** (Snake #1) is positioned at (7, 9), which is quite far from my position as well. No immediate threat as they are vertically distanced significantly from me.\n\n### Possible Moves\nFrom my current position (8, 4), the available moves I can make are:\n1. **UP** to (8, 5)\n2. **DOWN** to (8, 3)\n3. **LEFT** to (7, 4)\n4. **RIGHT** to (9, 4)\n\nConsidering my strategy to reach (5, 5):\n- **Moving UP to (8, 5)**: This position does not have an apple. However, it increases my chances to reevaluate my next move and potentially head towards (5, 5) on the subsequent turns since it keeps me moving toward the apples.\n- **Moving DOWN to (8, 3)**: This would take me back into already considered territory, where there are no apples. Avoiding backward moves is crucial here.\n- **Moving LEFT to (7, 4)**: No apple at (7, 4) and moves me horizontally without any vertical gain which is not optimal for reaching the apples in my sight (5, 5).\n- **Moving RIGHT to (9, 4)**: This moves me further away from the direction of the apple I am trying to reach.\n\n### Conclusion\nMoving **UP** to (8, 5) seems the most beneficial. This allows me the opportunity to reevaluate my position with the next move towards the ultimate goal of reaching (5, 5). \n\n### Next Move Decision: \nI will move UP.\n\n- **Decided next move**: UP"

However, it increases my chances to reevaluate my next move and potentially head towards (5, 5) on the subsequent turns since it keeps me moving toward the apples.\n- **Moving DOWN to (8, 3)**: This would take me back into already considered territory, where there are no apples. Avoiding backward moves is crucial here.\n- **Moving LEFT to (7, 4)**: No apple at (7, 4) and moves me horizontally without any vertical gain which is not optimal for reaching the apples in my sight (5, 5).\n- **Moving RIGHT to (9, 4)**: This moves me further away from the direction of the apple I am trying to reach.\n\n### Conclusion\nMoving **UP** to (8, 5) seems the most beneficial. This allows me the opportunity to reevaluate my position with the next move towards the ultimate goal of reaching (5, 5). \n\n### Next Move Decision: \nI will move UP.\n\n- **Decided next move**: UP"

To maximize movement, I should stay away from the enemy snake and try to position myself toward apples while avoiding potential blockages.\n\n#### Possible Next Moves\nSince I can't make productive moves from my current position, I can evaluate which direction offers future opportunities:\n- Moving **UP to (5, 6)** and looking to reconnect to the apple at (4, 6) but it\u2019s not directly accessible right now.\n- Moving **LEFT to (4, 5)** keeps me in a position where I can potentially move toward (4, 6) next turn.\n\nIn conclusion, I see that moving UP to (5, 6) allows me more pathways to explore potential apples while positioning myself away from the snake.\n\nDecided next move: UP"

Moreover, this moves me in a favorable direction towards the next possible apple at (5, 2) or (3, 1) in future moves.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\n1. **Prioritize Reaching Apples**: Always keep potential apple positions in mind, and go towards them when they are accessible, as they\u2019ll help me grow and increase my score.\n2. **Avoid Enemy Encounters**: Be aware of the positions of enemy snakes to ensure I avoid their body parts, as collisions would mean game-over.\n3. **Positioning**: After collecting the apple, consider how to position my snake for the next turn to either advance toward additional apples or retreat strategically to avoid enemies.\n\nThus, my decided next move will be **LEFT** to (7, 3), where I will collect the apple.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."

Moreover, this moves me in a favorable direction towards the next possible apple at (5, 2) or (3, 1) in future moves.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\n1. **Prioritize Reaching Apples**: Always keep potential apple positions in mind, and go towards them when they are accessible, as they\u2019ll help me grow and increase my score.\n2. **Avoid Enemy Encounters**: Be aware of the positions of enemy snakes to ensure I avoid their body parts, as collisions would mean game-over.\n3. **Positioning**: After collecting the apple, consider how to position my snake for the next turn to either advance toward additional apples or retreat strategically to avoid enemies.\n\nThus, my decided next move will be **LEFT** to (7, 3), where I will collect the apple.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."

The move I want to make is to the right, to (8, 2), which brings me to an apple. This will grow my snake and give me another point.\n\n### Analysis of Move Options:\n1. **UP to (7, 3)**: Not valid (self-collision).\n2. **DOWN to (7, 1)**: Valid and unoccupied but not strategic.\n3. **LEFT to (6, 2)**: Valid, but again does not contribute to apple collection.\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 2)**: Valid and allows me to collect an apple. This is the best option as it also helps in growing my snake.\n\n### Strategic Thoughts:\n- Collecting apples is crucial for growth and gaining points. \n- Moving to (8, 2) puts me in a favorable position for the next round, with space available to move afterward.\n- It's important to keep an eye on the enemy snake. I have to ensure that I can navigate away from potential threats after this move.\n\nGiven all the analysis, I will proceed with my move:\n\nDecided next move: **RIGHT**."

However, it increases my chances to reevaluate my next move and potentially head towards (5, 5) on the subsequent turns since it keeps me moving toward the apples.\n- **Moving DOWN to (8, 3)**: This would take me back into already considered territory, where there are no apples. Avoiding backward moves is crucial here.\n- **Moving LEFT to (7, 4)**: No apple at (7, 4) and moves me horizontally without any vertical gain which is not optimal for reaching the apples in my sight (5, 5).\n- **Moving RIGHT to (9, 4)**: This moves me further away from the direction of the apple I am trying to reach.\n\n### Conclusion\nMoving **UP** to (8, 5) seems the most beneficial. This allows me the opportunity to reevaluate my position with the next move towards the ultimate goal of reaching (5, 5). \n\n### Next Move Decision: \nI will move UP.\n\n- **Decided next move**: UP"
