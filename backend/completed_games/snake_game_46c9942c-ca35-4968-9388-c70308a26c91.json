This snake currently doesn't pose a direct threat due to its position and lack of a body.\n\n### Objectives:\n1. Move towards the nearest apple to grow.\n2. Avoid collisions with the walls.\n3. Plan pathways to collect more apples while avoiding potential hazards like other snakes.\n\n### Analysis of Apples:\n- **Apple at (2, 4)**: This apple is directly horizontal from my position.\n- **Apple at (6, 2)**: This is the second closest apple, towards the bottom-left.\n- The other apples are further away and less accessible for now due to distance and optimal pathing.\n\n### Potential Moves:\n1. **Right**: (8, 4)\n   - Pros: Stay on the same Y-coordinate, which can set up an easy approach to move Left to collect the apple at (2, 4) while having space to maneuver.\n   - Cons: No immediate reward by moving Right in terms of apple collection.\n\n2. **Up**: (7, 5)\n   - Pros: Keeps options open without immediate restriction.\n   - Cons: Moves upwards, away from apples initially prioritized.\n\n3. **Down**: (7, 3)\n   - Pros: Moves towards the bottom where there are apples at (6, 2) and could continue downward after moving left.\n   - Cons: Moving away from the apple at (2, 4).\n\n4. **Left**: (6, 4)\n   - Pros: Directly moves towards an apple at (2, 4).\n   - Cons: Reduces path options if constrained to consistently go straight without alternate routes for evasion or optimization.\n\n### Optimal Decision:\nInitially, moving **LEFT** to gather the apple at (2, 4) seems prudent. This destination aligns with both the current snake position and the strategic objective of collecting the nearest apple while keeping all potential pathways open.\n\nWith this plan:\n\n- Next Turn Strategy: After moving LEFT, assess the apples and enemy snake position. Given availability of space, possibilities include continuing leftwards for the apple at (2, 4) or changing direction depending on how the board evolves.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT"
