If the enemy snake moves in a way that threatens my path, prioritize avoiding collision over reaching the apple.\n3. After getting the apple at (0, 3), reevaluate the positions of the remaining apples and the enemy snake to determine the next target. The apple at (3, 0) might be a good choice since it's relatively close and not blocked by the enemy snake.\n\nConsidering the options, moving left to (1, 4) is the best choice as it brings me closer to the apple at (0, 3) without putting me in immediate danger from the enemy snake.\n\nLEFT"
