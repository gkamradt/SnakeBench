However, it starts a potential journey towards the lower left (especially targeting the apple at (7, 1)) without getting too close to the rival snake.\n\nGiven the current board dynamics and my strategic positioning, moving DOWN first and then planning to potentially snake up towards the other apples seems most prudent.
