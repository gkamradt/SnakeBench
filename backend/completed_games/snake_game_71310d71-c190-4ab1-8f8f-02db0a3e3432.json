However, LEFT (1, 0) leads me away from stacking my segments vertically to reach (2, 8).\n- Therefore, moving RIGHT to (3, 0) allows potential future movement toward (4,0) and trying to navigate towards the (4, 5) apple while keeping me aligned to target more apples efficiently.\n\nThus, the best move considering all aspects would be to go RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

However, LEFT (1, 0) leads me away from stacking my segments vertically to reach (2, 8).\n- Therefore, moving RIGHT to (3, 0) allows potential future movement toward (4,0) and trying to navigate towards the (4, 5) apple while keeping me aligned to target more apples efficiently.\n\nThus, the best move considering all aspects would be to go RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

The next step is to evaluate my current situation as I now stand at (2, 0) with one body segment.\n\n### Current Board Analysis\n- **Current Position**: My snake is now at (2, 0) with a body segment at [(2, 0)].\n- **Available Moves**:\n  - **UP (2, 1)**: This is safe and returns me back to my previous position, but it doesn\u2019t lead to an apple.\n  - **DOWN (2, -1)**: This move is invalid as it goes out of the board's boundary.\n  - **LEFT (1, 0)**: This is safe and leads to an empty space. \n  - **RIGHT (3, 0)**: This is also safe and leads to an empty space.\n  \n- **Apples Remaining**: \n  I still have the following apples on the board: \n  - (2, 8)\n  - (4, 5)\n  - (5, 8)\n  - (7, 8)\n\n### Strategy\n1. **Prioritizing Apples**: Since I just conquered an apple, I want to grow further and target more apples to increase my score. \n2. **Safety**: I need to avoid moving backward (into my own body) as that is against the rules.\n3. **Forward Movement**: The next apple on the board is located at (2, 8), which I can reach by navigating upwards through the open spaces.\n\n### Next Steps\n- Since I cannot move back (UP to (2, 1)), my most strategic option is to choose either LEFT or RIGHT. However, LEFT (1, 0) leads me away from stacking my segments vertically to reach (2, 8).\n- Therefore, moving RIGHT to (3, 0) allows potential future movement toward (4,0) and trying to navigate towards the (4, 5) apple while keeping me aligned to target more apples efficiently.\n\nThus, the best move considering all aspects would be to go RIGHT.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
