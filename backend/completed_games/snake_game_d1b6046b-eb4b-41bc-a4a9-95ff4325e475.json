It sets me on a trajectory to either attempt going down to (3, 4) or rightward again towards (4, 5), while providing some flexibility in strategy.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Move:\n- If I move right, I will stay adaptable and decide between going to (3, 4) or (4, 5) based on Snake #2's behavior.\n- Keep assessing threats and apple positions continuously.

It sets me on a trajectory to either attempt going down to (3, 4) or rightward again towards (4, 5), while providing some flexibility in strategy.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Move:\n- If I move right, I will stay adaptable and decide between going to (3, 4) or (4, 5) based on Snake #2's behavior.\n- Keep assessing threats and apple positions continuously.

Returns me toward the wall and away from apples.\n   - **DOWN**: Can't move down; already at (1, 7).\n   - **LEFT**: Moves me to (0, 7). Not useful here since there are no apples on the left.\n   - **RIGHT**: Moves to (2, 7), which opens a path toward the apples at (3, 4) or (4, 5).\n\nGiven these observations, moving **RIGHT** to (2, 7) seems the most advantageous as it positions me toward potential apples more efficiently. It sets me on a trajectory to either attempt going down to (3, 4) or rightward again towards (4, 5), while providing some flexibility in strategy.\n\n### Strategy for the Next Move:\n- If I move right, I will stay adaptable and decide between going to (3, 4) or (4, 5) based on Snake #2's behavior.\n- Keep assessing threats and apple positions continuously. My goal is to focus on points while staying safe from Snake #2.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"
