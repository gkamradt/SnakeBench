There is a direct threat if moving from current LEFT, might end up closer to the enemy.\n   - Walls and self-collision are not an immediate concern due to the clear path vertically and horizontally around the snake's current position.\n   \n4. **Strategic Forthcomings:**\n   - If the snake moves DOWN to (4, 2) first and then further down to (4, 1), it can eat an apple. Post this, if unobstructed, a left move collects the apple at (3, 1).\n   - Alternatively, a LEFT move might be setting up for a DOWN run directly grabbing the (3, 1) apple before moving to (4, 1).\n\n5. **Decided Next Move:**\n   - Considering the immediate goal to secure apples safely while keeping distance from the enemy snake and avoiding any risky moves near the walls or back onto itself:\n   - Moving DOWN seems strategically best to secure the apple at (4, 1) first and then possibly (3, 1). This keeps me away from enemy snake and walls while directly leading towards the target apples.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**\n\n**Predicted Next Strategy for Following Turn:**\nIf the following move after moving DOWN remains safe, another DOWN or potentially a LEFT to head towards the apple at (3, 1) would be ideal.

I choose to move DOWN this turn to position myself closer vertically to the apples at (4, 1) and (3, 1), and potentially consider a LEFT movement in future turns based on the surrounding scenario and the enemy snake's movement.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN.**\nThis move aims to spatially align closer to two apples while maintaining flexibility for subsequent strategic decisions either to continue vertically or turn left based on ongoing and new developments next turn."

If I move right toward (3, 3), I\u2019m not too close to the enemy snake at (6, 3). Keeping in mind that the enemy snake has a horizontal line available on row 3, I need to consider my next move carefully, ensuring I don\u2019t end up trapped by their potential moves if they decide to advance forward.\n\n### Best Move Consideration:\nAmong the evaluated directions, moving RIGHT to (3, 3) seems to be the best option. It keeps me in an optimal position where I can plan my next move towards apples, while still being cautious of the enemy's position.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\nI aim to keep evaluating the distance to the nearest apples on the following turn while also being mindful of maintaining distance from the enemy snake. I will consider checking direct moves toward (4, 1) or (7, 7) in the future, but for now, keeping options open is a priority.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT."

It is crucial to monitor its movements closely, especially with its proximity in the horizontal span. \n\n**Evaluation of Options:**\n- Moving UP or DOWN does not lead directly towards any apple, and DOWN is particularly risk-laden given the boundary of the board.\n- Moving RIGHT will increase the distance between my snake and the nearest apples.\n- Moving LEFT aligns well with both (4, 1) and (3, 1), reducing horizontal distance.\n\n**Strategic Aim:**\nThe primary goal will be to safely collect more apples, especially the closest ones, to ensure growth and point accumulation. After efficiently navigating towards these two nearby apples, evaluating potential paths towards (7, 7) and (4, 9) or repositioning based on enemy movement and other apple consumption will be crucial.\n\n**Next Move Strategy:**\nThe decision for this turn is to continue LEFT, which provides direct access to the closest apples of (4, 1) and (3, 1). This move will position my snake to potentially collect these apples swiftly, setting a foundation for further strategic maneuvers in the subsequent turns.\n\n_Current Position after the Move:_ Moving from (6, 3) to (5, 3).\n\n**Next Move: LEFT.**\nThis assures a closer approach towards the identified target apples, maintaining an advantageous position against the enemy snake, and aligning future moves for continued advantageous gameplay."

However, I seemed to have misrepresented my current position, as I just stated I'm at (3, 3). This was actually my last position, and moving RIGHT means I would now be at (4, 3).\n\n### Potential Moves From Current Position (4, 3):\n1. **UP to (4, 4)**: No apple at this position.\n2. **DOWN to (4, 2)**: No apple, but keeps options open.\n3. **LEFT to (3, 3)**: Movement back to a previous position. \n4. **RIGHT to (5, 3)**: Would land directly on the enemy snake.\n\n### Strategic Evaluation:\n- Moving UP to (4, 4) keeps options open but does not gain an apple.\n- Moving DOWN to (4, 2) does not gain an apple but prevents entanglement with the enemy snake. In future moves, it allows options toward (4, 1) for an apple.\n- Moving LEFT back to (3, 3) is not strategic, as it doesn't get me closer to any objectives.\n- Moving RIGHT to (5, 3) is a bad move since that's where the enemy snake is.\n\n### Conclusion:\nTo maximize my options while safely navigating around the enemy, my best move from (4, 3) is DOWN to (4, 2). This keeps me out of conflict and sets me up for a chance to position myself for (4, 1) or explore further downwards.\n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\nNext turn, I will need to evaluate moves toward (4, 1) while keeping my distance from enemy snake #2.

Given the current position, moving LEFT by 1 will not immediately gather them, but will align better for a subsequent downward move. It's integral to aim for these apples due to their proximity and potential to boost growth with reduced maneuvering requirements.\n\n**Potential Obstacles:**\n- Keep an eye on Snake #1 at (3, 3). While it's clear this time, its movement could pose future threats depending on its trajectory. Ensuring no hindering overlap occurs is crucial.\n  \n**Evaluation of Additional Options:**\n- Moving UP or DOWN from this position does not foster immediate benefits since they neither connote direct routes to apples nor provide strategic defense or advancement.\n- Moving RIGHT increases the distance from target apples at (4, 1) and (3, 1), which does not align with the priority of acquiring these apples swiftly.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nIt\u2019s paramount to decide each move based on proximity to apples, enemy snake positions, and growth opportunities. Right now, steering clear of any risky encounters while zeroing in on (4, 1) and (3, 1) is a judicious strategy.\n\n**Next Move:**\nContinuing LEFT makes the most tactical sense under the present circumstances, setting a straighter path to the targeted apples. This will aid in a planned following move DOWN to reach and potentially consume both apples subsequently.\n\n**Planned Strategy for Following Turn:**\nThe next strategic action after moving LEFT will likely involve pushing DOWN twice upon confirming the clearance and safety, ensuring the acquisition of the apples at (4, 1) and (3, 1) remains unhindered.\n\n**Decision for Current Move**: LEFT"

Considering the snake's position at (4, 3), I will thoroughly assess options and potential moves:\n\n1. **Direction and Immediate Targets:**\n   - Apples are present near positions (4, 1) and (3, 1) directly below the current position of the snake. These are accessible and can be a substantial gain in points if collected safely.\n\n2. **Current Position and Possible Moves:**\n   - Currently positioned at (4, 3), the snake can move in any of the four directions. Moving RIGHT or LEFT doesn't immediately help in reaching these apples. A move DOWN would begin to position the snake towards these apples.\n\n3. **Potential Threats and Obstacles:**\n   - The enemy snake (#1) is at (3, 2) and has an empty body list, indicating it's just a head or the body hasn't been reported. There is a direct threat if moving from current LEFT, might end up closer to the enemy.\n   - Walls and self-collision are not an immediate concern due to the clear path vertically and horizontally around the snake's current position.\n   \n4. **Strategic Forthcomings:**\n   - If the snake moves DOWN to (4, 2) first and then further down to (4, 1), it can eat an apple. Post this, if unobstructed, a left move collects the apple at (3, 1).\n   - Alternatively, a LEFT move might be setting up for a DOWN run directly grabbing the (3, 1) apple before moving to (4, 1).\n\n5. **Decided Next Move:**\n   - Considering the immediate goal to secure apples safely while keeping distance from the enemy snake and avoiding any risky moves near the walls or back onto itself:\n   - Moving DOWN seems strategically best to secure the apple at (4, 1) first and then possibly (3, 1). This keeps me away from enemy snake and walls while directly leading towards the target apples.\n\n**Next Move: DOWN**\n\n**Predicted Next Strategy for Following Turn:**\nIf the following move after moving DOWN remains safe, another DOWN or potentially a LEFT to head towards the apple at (3, 1) would be ideal.
