The closest apple is at (1, 1), which is to the right of my current position.\n\nHowever, I should be cautious of the enemy snake's potential moves. If the enemy snake decides to move left, it could potentially cut off my path to the apple at (1, 1).\n\nTo mitigate this risk, I could consider going for the apple at (3, 0), which is a little further away but safer from the enemy snake's potential moves.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: Prioritize reaching the apple at (3, 0) while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's movements. If the enemy snake moves away from the top-right corner, I can reconsider going for the apple at (1, 1).\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

Moving left (to (7, 4)) would bring me closer to the apple at (5, 3), but it's not an immediate apple pickup. Moving right (to (9, 4)) would move me away from the apples, so that's not a good option.
