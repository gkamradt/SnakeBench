Considering my current position and the length of my body, I believe it is best to move RIGHT for this turn. This will allow me to start making my way towards the apple at (8, 4) while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\n5. After moving RIGHT, I should continue moving towards the apple at (8, 4) while being mindful of the enemy snake's movements. If the enemy snake starts to approach the apple at (8, 4), I may need to adjust my strategy and consider targeting the apples at (3, 3) and (4, 3) instead.\n\n6. It is essential to keep monitoring the board state and adapt my strategy as needed to ensure that I collect the remaining apples safely and efficiently.\n\nReminder for next turn: After moving RIGHT, continue making your way towards the apple at (8, 4) while being mindful of the enemy snake's movements. If the enemy snake starts to approach the apple at (8, 4), consider adjusting your strategy and targeting the apples at (3, 3) and (4, 3) instead. Keep monitoring the board state and adapt your strategy as needed to ensure that you collect the remaining apples safely and efficiently.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"

RIGHT to (5, 8)**\n- **Pros**:\n  - **Proximity to Immediate Apple**: Moving right positions the snake closer to the apple at (6, 8), which can be reached in the next move, allowing for a quick point gain.\n  - **Central Advancement**: Progressing towards the center-right keeps options open for accessing other apples in that quadrant.\n- **Cons**:\n  - **Adjacent to Enemy Snake**: The enemy snake is at (6, 7). Moving right brings the snake closer to the enemy, which could pose risks in subsequent moves if paths converge.\n  - **Potential Blocking**: If the enemy decides to move upwards or sideways, there's a chance of encountering each other, leading to possible collisions.\n\n### **2. UP to (4, 9)**\n- **Pros**:\n  - **Avoids Immediate Conflict**: Moving up steers clear of the enemy snake's current position, reducing the risk of immediate collisions.\n  - **Access to Top Apples**: Positions the snake closer to the apples at (1, 9) and (7, 9), which can be strategic targets for point accumulation.\n- **Cons**:\n  - **Distance from Nearby Apple**: This move delays access to the apple at (6, 8), potentially missing out on a quick point.\n  - **Limited Future Movement**: Being near the top edge restricts upward movement in future turns, necessitating careful navigation to avoid getting trapped.\n\n### **3. LEFT to (3, 8)**\n- **Pros**:\n  - **Path to Left-Side Apple**: Moves the snake towards the apple at (1, 9), which can be a valuable target if executed correctly.\n  - **Maintains Central Control**: Staying towards the center allows flexibility in accessing various parts of the board.\n- **Cons**:\n  - **No Immediate Apple Access**: Unlike moving right, this direction doesn't provide an immediate opportunity to collect an apple.\n  - **Potential Isolation**: Moving left could limit quick access to the apples concentrated towards the top and right, possibly making the snake vulnerable to being boxed in.\n\n### **Strategy Considerations for Future Turns**:\n- **Prioritize Immediate Gains**: Collecting nearby apples can lead to quicker point accumulation, providing an advantage over opponents.\n- **Maintain Safe Distances from Enemies**: Always be mindful of enemy positions to minimize collision risks, especially when navigating towards contested areas.\n- **Ensure Multiple Path Options**: Avoid getting trapped by keeping potential movement paths open, allowing for adaptability based on how the game unfolds.\n- **Plan for Expansion**: As the snake grows, plan routes that minimize self-collision risks and optimize space utilization.\n\n**Decided next move:** **RIGHT**"

The apple at (1, 9) is farther away and may require more moves to reach safely, while the apple at (8, 4) is closer but could potentially put me in a risky position near the edge of the board.\n\n4. I should also consider the apple at (7, 9) as a potential target after collecting the one at (6, 8). It's relatively close and could be a safer option compared to the other two apples.\n\n5. For now, I should focus on collecting the apple at (6, 8) by moving UP. This will allow me to grow in length and increase my score.\n\n6. I'll continue monitoring the enemy snake's movements and adjust my strategy accordingly in the coming turns.\n\nReminder for next turn: After collecting the apple at (6, 8), evaluate the risks and benefits of targeting either the apple at (1, 9), (8, 4), or (7, 9). Consider the enemy snake's position and potential movements, and prioritize avoiding collisions and traps. Be prepared to adapt my strategy based on the changing game state.\n\nNext move: UP"
