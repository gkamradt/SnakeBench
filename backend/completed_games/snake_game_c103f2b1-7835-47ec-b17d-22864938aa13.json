This move will allow me to gain a point while also maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake's body.\n\nStrategy for next turn:\nAfter moving DOWN and eating the apple at (1, 4), I should continue to observe the enemy snake's movements and the positions of the remaining apples.

If the enemy snake moves in a way that blocks my path to the apple at (1, 4), I may need to consider changing my strategy and moving towards a different apple.
