Moving towards that apple would keep me away from the enemy snake for now.\n\nI also need to consider the other apples at (7, 5), (3, 5), and (5, 4), which are a bit further away but could be good targets for later in the game.\n\nMy strategy for now should be to prioritize the apple at (5, 9) while avoiding any immediate threats from the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: UP"
