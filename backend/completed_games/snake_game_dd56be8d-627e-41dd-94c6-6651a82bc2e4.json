Now, I need to assess the current situation and plan my next move.\n\nLooking at the board, the closest apple is at (3, 5), which is four steps away. However, there's another apple at (2, 0) that's also relatively close, just three steps away.\n\nThe enemy snake is currently at (7, 0), which is far from my current position. I don't have to worry about a potential collision with the enemy snake in the immediate future.\n\nStrategy for next turns:\n- Collect the apple at (2, 0) by moving down twice and left once.\n- After collecting the apple, re-evaluate the positions of the remaining apples and the enemy snake.\n- Continue prioritizing nearby apples while maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n- Consider the long-term strategy of controlling the center of the board and limiting the enemy snake's access to apples.\n\nReminder for next turn: After collecting the apple at (2, 0), look for the next closest apple and plan the route accordingly. Keep monitoring the enemy snake's movements and adjust the strategy if needed.\n\nNext move: DOWN"
