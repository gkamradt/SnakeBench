Based on my last move to the right, the objective is to move to the right again to collect the apple at (9, 9). \n\n### Current Position Recap\n- My current position is (8, 9).\n- I have the option to collect an apple at (9, 9) by moving right, which is a direct win from my current position.\n\n### Move Options\n1. **Move RIGHT (9, 9)**: This is the optimal move since it allows me to collect the apple.\n2. **Move UP (8, 10)**: This move is out of bounds; it's invalid.\n3. **Move DOWN (8, 8)**: This is a backward move and does not help in collecting apples.\n4. **Move LEFT (7, 9)**: This would not be a desired move as it takes me away from the apple.\n\n### Strategy Moving Forward\nAfter collecting the apple at (9, 9), I\u2019ll grow by one point. The next step is to quickly assess the nearest apple positions after that. Apples are located at (3, 0), (7, 6), (9, 7), (5, 2), and (4, 2). Approaching these when they are reachable while keeping an eye on the enemy snake's position is crucial.\n\nHowever, the immediate focus is simply to collect the apple at (9, 9). \n\nDecided next move: RIGHT."
