The closest apple from the start position appears to be at (2, 4).\n3. **Enemy Snake:** Snake #2 at (9, 9) currently has no body and thus isn't a direct threat unless it's on a path to intersect mine.\n4. **Path Planning:** Increasing x gets me closer to several apples. Specifically, moving RIGHT puts me more inline to approach both the (2, 4) and eventually the (2, 6) apples.\n\nConsidering the position, enemy presence, and apple locations:\n- **Safe Path:** Starting by moving RIGHT. This avoids any immediate collision, and sets a path towards the nearest apple. It also keeps a safe distance from the enemy snake and keeps options open for either moving UP towards more apples or continuing RIGHT depending on the enemy's movements in the next turns.\n\n**Next Move Decision:** RIGHT\n\n**Future Strategy Thought:** Monitor the movement of Snake #2, especially its direction. If it heads south or stays at the top, I'll have a clearer path to the central and lower apples. Always keep an eye for the shortest route to the next closest apple while avoiding potential trapping by the board edges."
