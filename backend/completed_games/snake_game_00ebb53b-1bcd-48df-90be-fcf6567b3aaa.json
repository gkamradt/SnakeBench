And what's with the last move information saying I moved LEFT? That's not what I did...\n\nOkay, let's assume I'm at (6, 5) now. My closest apple is still the one at (5, 7). To get there, I need to move UP. I'll keep an eye on Snake #2, but for now, it's not a threat.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Continue to move towards the apple at (5, 7) while keeping an eye on Snake #2's movement.\n\nNext, I'll move...
