I'm still not close enough to the apple at (8, 7), but I'm getting closer.\n\nI see that Snake #1 is still at (8, 2), which is a bit far from me, so I'm not too worried about it for now. I also notice that I'm getting closer to the apple at (1, 4), but I'm not sure if I should prioritize that one over the apple at (8, 7).\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to try to get closer to the apple at (8, 7). I think I'll prioritize moving up to get closer to the apple. If I move up, I'll be at (8, 9) and still have the option to move to the right to get closer to the apple.\n\nHmm, I'm not sure if I should move up or to the right more. I think I'll prioritize moving up to get closer to the apple. If I move up, I'll be at (8, 9) and still have the option to move to the right to get closer to the apple.\n\nMy next move is... UP."
