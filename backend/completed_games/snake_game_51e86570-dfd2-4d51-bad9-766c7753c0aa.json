But we should keep an eye on it.\n\nSince we are still at the top row, I'll continue moving left to get closer to the apple. But I also notice that there's an apple at (0, 9) which is very close to us. If we move left one more time, we'll be at (2, 9), and then we can move down to (2, 8) and then to (2, 7) to get the apple.\n\nBut, I think it's better to get the apple at (0, 9) first, since it's closer to us. We can move left to (2, 9) and then up to (0, 9) to get the apple.\n\nMy strategy for now is to get the apple at (0, 9) first, and then move towards the apple at (2, 7).\n\nMy next move is: LEFT"

This is a good starting position as now we're strategizing from a tie point perspective.\nLooking at the board, the closest apple to our current position is (0,3) since we're in the top most Y coordinate. Any horizontal movement will take us farther away from the next apple, so it's strategic to move in the downward direction.\nIn terms of threat assessment, it seems like Snake #2 will indeed move towards the right in the direction of the apple at (7,7), which actually works in our favour. This essentially leaves the entire left side of the board open for our movement and for possibly new apples spawning.\n\nStrategy for the next turn:\nImmediately after securing the point, our next direction should be moving down towards the apple at (0,3). At the same time, keep an eye out on the enemy snake. If there's a sudden change in trajectory or a new apple spawns in our sector (left side), we might need to adjust our strategy.\n\nMy decided next move: DOWN"

This means I must have moved left from (3, 9) to (2, 9) in the previous turn.\n\nNow, let's analyze the current situation. I'm at position (2, 9), and there's an enemy snake at position (0, 9) with a body at [(0, 8)]. I should avoid moving left to (1, 9) or (0, 9) as it might lead to a collision with the enemy snake.\n\nHowever, I notice that there's an apple at (2, 7) which is very close to me. I can move down to (2, 8) and then to (2, 7) to get the apple.\n\nMy strategy for now is to move down to get the apple at (2, 7).\n\nMy next move is: DOWN"
