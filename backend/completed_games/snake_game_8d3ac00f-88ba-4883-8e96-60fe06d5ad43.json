I'm not too close to any of them, so I need to decide on a direction to move.\n\nI notice that there's an enemy snake at position (0, 2), which is relatively close to me. I don't want to run into it, so I'll try to move away from it. I also see that there's an apple at (0, 6), which is relatively close to my current position. I'll try to move towards it.\n\nMy strategy for this turn is to move towards the apple at (0, 6) while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nI can move down to (3, 1) and then down again to (2, 1), and then down again to (1, 1), and then down again to (0, 1), and then down again to (0, 6). This way, I'll be moving towards the apple while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nBut wait, I don't want to move into the same position as the enemy snake! I'll need to adjust my strategy.\n\nI can move down to (3, 1) and then down again to (2, 1), and then down again to (1, 2), and then down again to (0, 3), and then down again to (0, 6). This way, I'll be moving towards the apple while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: DOWN"
