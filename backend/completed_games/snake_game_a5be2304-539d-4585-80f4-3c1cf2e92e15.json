I should prioritize moving towards these apples.\n\nHowever, I also need to be cautious of Snake #2, which is at position (3, 7). If I move too close to it, I risk colliding with it.\n\nConsidering my current position and the available apples, my next move should be to move towards the apple at (1, 9). This will give me a good opportunity to collect a point and also put some distance between myself and Snake #2.\n\nStrategy for next turn: I'll try to move towards the apple at (1, 9) and see if I can avoid any potential collisions with Snake #2.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

Since I'm currently at (3, 7), I can move up (y-1), down (y+1), left (x-1), or right (x+1).\n\nNow, let's consider the apples. There are three apples within one move from my current position: (3, 6), (3, 8), and (4, 7). The apple at (4, 7) is the closest one, and it's also not on the path of any enemy snake.\n\nHowever, moving to (4, 7) would put me in the same position as the enemy snake #1, which is not a good idea as it could potentially collide with me in the future.\n\nSo, I'll choose to move towards an apple that is further but still within one move, and that's the apple at (3, 8). This move will also keep some distance from the enemy snake #1.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to move towards the apple at (2, 8) or (4, 8) to continue growing and maintaining distance from the enemy snake #1.\n\nNext move: UP (y-1)"
