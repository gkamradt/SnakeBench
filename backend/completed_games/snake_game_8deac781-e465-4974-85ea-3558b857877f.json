No immediate threat in adjacent cells to my current position.\n\n**Safety Considerations**:\n- **UP** to (4, 5): Safe and moves closer to the apple at (6, 5) and aligns with moving towards (4, 8).\n- **DOWN** to (4, 3): Safe but moves away from both nearby apple positions.\n- **LEFT** to (3, 4): Safe but does not advance towards any apple.\n- **RIGHT** to (5, 4): Currently occupied by my own body (tail). Moving here may result in a collision as the tail isn't moving away immediately.\n\n**Strategy**:\n1. **Primary Goal**: **Approach the nearest available apples** to maximize point accumulation. Moving **UP** towards (4, 5) positions the snake closer to (6, 5) and keeps the path open towards (4, 8).\n2. **Secondary Goal**: **Maintain flexibility and avoid trapping**. By moving UP, the snake preserves multiple pathways for future movements, reducing the risk of getting cornered.\n\n**Next Turn Strategy**:\n- After moving **UP** to (4, 5), continue navigating towards (6, 5) to collect the apple while monitoring the enemy snake's movements to avoid potential conflicts. Ensure that subsequent moves keep the snake's path open and avoid blocking potential routes to other apples.\n\n**Decided Next Move**: **UP**"
