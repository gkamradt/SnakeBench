There is no immediate threat from Snake #2 by taking this path.\n\n**Next Move**: LEFT"

Enemy snake 1 is at (8, 8).\n\nMoving down would be suicide as it would lead to a collision with snake 1. Moving left or right would not lead to any immediate benefit. Moving up would keep me alive and potentially open up future opportunities.\n\nNext turn, I should consider moving towards the apples at (4, 4) or (5, 0), depending on the enemy snake's movement.\n\nUP"
