            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm snake 2, starting at (7,9). The board is 10x10, with apples at (5,5), (2,5), (9,3), (2,3), (2,4). My body is empty, so I'm just the head. The enemy snake is at (6,3) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move. Since I'm at (7,9), the edges are nearby. Let's check possible moves:\n\nUP: From (7,9), moving up would take me to (7,10), which is outside the board. That's a wall, so that's instant death. So UP is not an option.\n\nDOWN: Moving down to (7,8). That's safe as long as there's no snake there. The board state shows row 9 (y=9) has me at (7,9), and row 8 (y=8) is empty. So moving down to (7,8) is okay. But where's the nearest apple?\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,5), (2,5), etc. But from (7,9), moving down to (7,8) doesn't get me closer to any apple. Maybe I should head towards the apples. Let's see the positions.\n\nThe apple at (9,3) is in the top right corner. But that's far from me. The apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are all in the left side. The apple at (5,5) is in the middle. So maybe I should go left towards the middle or left side.\n\nIf I move LEFT from (7,9), that's (6,9). Then check if that's safe. The board shows row 9 (y=9) has snake 2 at (7,9) and nothing else. So (6,9) is empty. Then moving left again would get me closer to the center. But maybe I can plan a path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is within the board. But there's no apple there. So maybe not the best choice.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I move down to (7,8), then maybe continue down towards (7,7), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving left towards (6,9), then (5,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then continue left towards the apples. The apples at (2,5) are at y=5. So from (7,8), moving down to y=7, 6, 5... but that's a few steps. Alternatively, moving left towards x=6,5,4, etc.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is at x=5, y=5. So from (7,9), moving left and down. Let's calculate the distance. The Manhattan distance from (7,9) to (5,5) is (7-5)+(9-5)=2+4=6. To get there, I need to go left twice and down four times. But that's a long path. Are there any obstacles in the way?\n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake is at (6,3). So in row 3, column 6. So if I go down towards y=5, maybe that's safe. But I need to check if moving left or down first is better.\n\nAlternatively, the apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered on the left side. Maybe those are easier to reach. The distance from (7,9) to (2,5) is (7-2)+(9-5)=5+4=9. That's a longer path, but maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe it's better to go for the closest apple first. Let's see which apple is closest. The apple at (5,5) is 6 steps away. The apple at (2,5) is 9 steps. The apple at (9,3) is (7-9= -2 in x, 9-3=6 in y) so distance 8. The apples at (2,3) and (2,4) are even further. So the closest is (5,5).\n\nSo maybe head towards (5,5). To get there, I need to move left and down. From (7,9), moving left to (6,9) then down to (6,8), etc. But each step needs to avoid walls and other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first. From (7,9), moving down to (7,8). Then left to (6,8), then down to (6,7), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). But need to check if there's any conflict with the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3), which is in the lower part. So as long as I don't go into that area, I should be safe.\n\nAnother consideration: since the enemy snake is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards the apples at (2,3) or (2,4). So if I go towards (5,5), maybe I can avoid conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,3) is in the top right. From (7,9), moving right to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's a longer path. Also, moving right from (7,9) to (8,9) is safe, but then next steps would be down towards (9,3). But that's a long way. Maybe not the best option.\n\nSo the best initial move is probably LEFT or DOWN. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), then down towards (5,8), etc. But that's moving along the top edge. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is safer? Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is far away, maybe both directions are safe. But moving LEFT first might get me closer to the center apples faster.\n\nWait, but moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is safe. Then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe moving LEFT first is better to start heading towards the apples. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) and then LEFT. Let's check if there's any immediate danger.\n\nThe board shows that the enemy snake is at (6,3), which is far from my current position. So moving LEFT or DOWN is safe. The only immediate danger is moving into a wall or another snake. Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is not in my path yet.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT. UP is invalid. So between LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT would take me to (8,9). Then next move could be RIGHT again to (9,9), but that's the edge. Then I can't go further right. So maybe not useful. Unless there's an apple there, but there's none. So RIGHT is not helpful.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better for reaching the closest apple (5,5)?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), etc. That's 4 moves to reach (5,7), then another down to (5,6), then (5,5). So total 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Same number of steps. So either way, same distance.\n\nBut maybe moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples as well. For example, after moving LEFT to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Alternatively, moving DOWN first.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I can reach it before the enemy snake, that's good. But the enemy is at (6,3), which is closer to (5,5) than I am. So maybe they will get there first. Hmm.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,3). The distance from (6,3) to (5,5) is (6-5)+(5-3)=1+2=3. So they can reach it in 3 moves. My distance is 6 moves. So they might get there first. So maybe that apple is not the best target.\n\nIn that case, maybe I should target another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered. The distance from me to (2,5) is 5 in x and 4 in y. So Manhattan distance 9. But maybe the enemy is not going for those. Let's see the enemy's position at (6,3). The distance from them to (2,5) is (6-2)+(5-3)=4+2=6. So they are 6 steps away. I'm 9 steps away. So they might still get there first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,3) is at (9,3). The enemy is at (6,3). So the enemy is 3 steps away (moving right). I'm at (7,9), so distance is (9-7)+(9-3)=2+6=8. So the enemy can reach (9,3) in 3 steps (right, right, right). But the apple is already at (9,3). Wait, the apple is already there. So if the enemy moves right three times, they can get it. But maybe they are heading that way. So perhaps that apple is not a good target for me.\n\nSo maybe the best option is to go for the apple at (5,5) even if the enemy is closer. But since the enemy is at (6,3), they might reach it first. So maybe I should look for another apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a path to collect multiple apples. For example, if I go towards the cluster at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), I can collect them in sequence. But that's a long way. Let's see the path.\n\nFrom (7,9), moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5). Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's recalculate.\n\nFrom (7,9), move left to (6,9) (1), down to (6,8) (2), left to (5,8) (3), down to (5,7) (4), down to (5,6) (5), down to (5,5) (6). So 6 moves to reach (5,5). But the enemy is 3 moves away. So they would get there first. So maybe that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going towards (2,3) or (9,3). But I can't know for sure. So perhaps I should target an apple that's less contested.\n\nLooking at the apples, (9,3) is in the enemy's vicinity, so they might go for that. The apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are in the left. Maybe I can head there. But it's a long path. Alternatively, maybe there's a safer apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is at (2,5). From my position (7,9), moving left and down. Let's see the path. Moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5) which I could collect on the way. Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's see:\n\nFrom (7,9) to (5,5): 6 moves. Then from (5,5) to (2,5): 3 moves left. So total 9 moves. But again, the enemy might get (5,5) first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (2,5) directly. But that's a long way. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to head towards the nearest apple that's not in the enemy's immediate path. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards (9,3) or (2,3). If they go right, they can reach (9,3) in 3 moves. If they go left, they can reach (2,3) in 4 moves. So maybe they are going for (9,3). So perhaps I should avoid that area.\n\nIn that case, maybe the apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are safer. But again, it's a long path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just start moving towards the center to have more options. Let's think about the first move.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next turn I can move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards the center. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is better? Both are safe. Maybe moving LEFT first to start heading towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to get away from the top edge. Since being on the edge can limit movement options. If I move DOWN to (7,8), I'm one step away from the edge. Then I can move LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), that's the same x-coordinate as the enemy, but far away. So no conflict.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) is safe.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best initial move is LEFT to start heading towards the apples on the left. Then next moves can be down and left towards (5,5) or (2,5). But I need to make sure I don't get trapped.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) gives me more space. Let's see the board again.\n\nThe board shows that row 9 (y=9) has me at (7,9). Row 8 is empty. So moving down to (7,8) is safe. Then from there, I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,8), then next move LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards (5,5). But again, the enemy is closer to (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move LEFT first to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are moving towards (5,5). So if I go towards (5,5), I might collide with them. Or maybe not. It's hard to predict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest first move is DOWN to (7,8), then assess next steps. That way, I'm moving away from the edge and into more open space. Then from (7,8), I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut I need to collect apples to grow. So the priority is to reach an apple as soon as possible. The closest apple is (5,5), but the enemy is closer. The next closest is (2,5), but that's far. The apple at (9,3) is also far.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no safe apple to reach before the enemy, so I should just move towards an area with multiple apples, even if it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best first move is LEFT to (6,9), then continue left towards (5,9), (4,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's moving away from the apples.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Since the snake is just starting, maybe the best move is to head towards the nearest apple, even if the enemy is closer. Because if I don't collect apples, I can't grow, and the enemy might get them all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going for (9,3). So if I move towards (5,5), I can get there in 6 moves, and maybe the enemy is not going there.\n\nBut without knowing the enemy's direction, it's hard to say. So perhaps I should take the risk and head towards (5,5).\n\nSo first move: LEFT to (6,9). Then next move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nAlternatively, first move DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich is better? Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT first, I'm at (6,9). Then next move can be DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), DOWN to (5,7), etc.\n\nIf I move DOWN first, I'm at (7,8). Then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nEither way, the path is similar. But moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples earlier.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gives me more space to maneuver.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), then down, I'm on the same x-coordinate as the enemy. But they are far below, so no immediate danger.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) keeps me away from the enemy's x-coordinate.\n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN first is safer to avoid potential paths where the enemy might come up. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), they might move up towards (6,4), etc. So if I'm at (6,9), moving down, there's a lot of space between us.\n\nI think either direction is safe. But since I need to choose between LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (UP is invalid), and RIGHT leads away from apples, the best options are LEFT or DOWN.\n\nSince the apple at (5,5) is in the middle, moving LEFT or DOWN both start the journey towards it. But moving LEFT first might be better to start reducing the x-coordinate towards 5.\n\nSo I'll choose LEFT as the first move. Then next move can be DOWN. That way, I'm heading towards the center and the apple.\n\nBut wait, moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe. Then next move DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a valid path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, but moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left apples.\n\nSo the first move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (5,5) and avoid immediate danger, moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) starts the journey towards the center while staying safe. This direction positions me to continue down and left in subsequent moves, navigating towards the apple cluster. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

The apple at (5,5) is in the middle. So maybe I should go left towards the middle or left side.\n\nIf I move LEFT from (7,9), that's (6,9). Then check if that's safe. The board shows row 9 (y=9) has snake 2 at (7,9) and nothing else. So (6,9) is empty. Then moving left again would get me closer to the center. But maybe I can plan a path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is within the board. But there's no apple there. So maybe not the best choice.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I move down to (7,8), then maybe continue down towards (7,7), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving left towards (6,9), then (5,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then continue left towards the apples. The apples at (2,5) are at y=5. So from (7,8), moving down to y=7, 6, 5... but that's a few steps. Alternatively, moving left towards x=6,5,4, etc.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is at x=5, y=5. So from (7,9), moving left and down. Let's calculate the distance. The Manhattan distance from (7,9) to (5,5) is (7-5)+(9-5)=2+4=6. To get there, I need to go left twice and down four times. But that's a long path. Are there any obstacles in the way?\n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake is at (6,3). So in row 3, column 6. So if I go down towards y=5, maybe that's safe. But I need to check if moving left or down first is better.\n\nAlternatively, the apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered on the left side. Maybe those are easier to reach. The distance from (7,9) to (2,5) is (7-2)+(9-5)=5+4=9. That's a longer path, but maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe it's better to go for the closest apple first. Let's see which apple is closest. The apple at (5,5) is 6 steps away. The apple at (2,5) is 9 steps. The apple at (9,3) is (7-9= -2 in x, 9-3=6 in y) so distance 8. The apples at (2,3) and (2,4) are even further. So the closest is (5,5).\n\nSo maybe head towards (5,5). To get there, I need to move left and down. From (7,9), moving left to (6,9) then down to (6,8), etc. But each step needs to avoid walls and other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first. From (7,9), moving down to (7,8). Then left to (6,8), then down to (6,7), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). But need to check if there's any conflict with the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3), which is in the lower part. So as long as I don't go into that area, I should be safe.\n\nAnother consideration: since the enemy snake is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards the apples at (2,3) or (2,4). So if I go towards (5,5), maybe I can avoid conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,3) is in the top right. From (7,9), moving right to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's a longer path. Also, moving right from (7,9) to (8,9) is safe, but then next steps would be down towards (9,3). But that's a long way. Maybe not the best option.\n\nSo the best initial move is probably LEFT or DOWN. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), then down towards (5,8), etc. But that's moving along the top edge. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is safer? Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is far away, maybe both directions are safe. But moving LEFT first might get me closer to the center apples faster.\n\nWait, but moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is safe. Then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe moving LEFT first is better to start heading towards the apples. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) and then LEFT. Let's check if there's any immediate danger.\n\nThe board shows that the enemy snake is at (6,3), which is far from my current position. So moving LEFT or DOWN is safe. The only immediate danger is moving into a wall or another snake. Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is not in my path yet.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT. UP is invalid. So between LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT would take me to (8,9). Then next move could be RIGHT again to (9,9), but that's the edge. Then I can't go further right. So maybe not useful. Unless there's an apple there, but there's none. So RIGHT is not helpful.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better for reaching the closest apple (5,5)?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), etc. That's 4 moves to reach (5,7), then another down to (5,6), then (5,5). So total 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Same number of steps. So either way, same distance.\n\nBut maybe moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples as well. For example, after moving LEFT to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Alternatively, moving DOWN first.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I can reach it before the enemy snake, that's good. But the enemy is at (6,3), which is closer to (5,5) than I am. So maybe they will get there first. Hmm.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,3). The distance from (6,3) to (5,5) is (6-5)+(5-3)=1+2=3. So they can reach it in 3 moves. My distance is 6 moves. So they might get there first. So maybe that apple is not the best target.\n\nIn that case, maybe I should target another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered. The distance from me to (2,5) is 5 in x and 4 in y. So Manhattan distance 9. But maybe the enemy is not going for those. Let's see the enemy's position at (6,3). The distance from them to (2,5) is (6-2)+(5-3)=4+2=6. So they are 6 steps away. I'm 9 steps away. So they might still get there first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,3) is at (9,3). The enemy is at (6,3). So the enemy is 3 steps away (moving right). I'm at (7,9), so distance is (9-7)+(9-3)=2+6=8. So the enemy can reach (9,3) in 3 steps (right, right, right). But the apple is already at (9,3). Wait, the apple is already there. So if the enemy moves right three times, they can get it. But maybe they are heading that way. So perhaps that apple is not a good target for me.\n\nSo maybe the best option is to go for the apple at (5,5) even if the enemy is closer. But since the enemy is at (6,3), they might reach it first. So maybe I should look for another apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a path to collect multiple apples. For example, if I go towards the cluster at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), I can collect them in sequence. But that's a long way. Let's see the path.\n\nFrom (7,9), moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5). Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's recalculate.\n\nFrom (7,9), move left to (6,9) (1), down to (6,8) (2), left to (5,8) (3), down to (5,7) (4), down to (5,6) (5), down to (5,5) (6). So 6 moves to reach (5,5). But the enemy is 3 moves away. So they would get there first. So maybe that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going towards (2,3) or (9,3). But I can't know for sure. So perhaps I should target an apple that's less contested.\n\nLooking at the apples, (9,3) is in the enemy's vicinity, so they might go for that. The apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are in the left. Maybe I can head there. But it's a long path. Alternatively, maybe there's a safer apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is at (2,5). From my position (7,9), moving left and down. Let's see the path. Moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5) which I could collect on the way. Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's see:\n\nFrom (7,9) to (5,5): 6 moves. Then from (5,5) to (2,5): 3 moves left. So total 9 moves. But again, the enemy might get (5,5) first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (2,5) directly. But that's a long way. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to head towards the nearest apple that's not in the enemy's immediate path. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards (9,3) or (2,3). If they go right, they can reach (9,3) in 3 moves. If they go left, they can reach (2,3) in 4 moves. So maybe they are going for (9,3). So perhaps I should avoid that area.\n\nIn that case, maybe the apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are safer. But again, it's a long path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just start moving towards the center to have more options. Let's think about the first move.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next turn I can move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards the center. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is better? Both are safe. Maybe moving LEFT first to start heading towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to get away from the top edge. Since being on the edge can limit movement options. If I move DOWN to (7,8), I'm one step away from the edge. Then I can move LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), that's the same x-coordinate as the enemy, but far away. So no conflict.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) is safe.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best initial move is LEFT to start heading towards the apples on the left. Then next moves can be down and left towards (5,5) or (2,5). But I need to make sure I don't get trapped.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) gives me more space. Let's see the board again.\n\nThe board shows that row 9 (y=9) has me at (7,9). Row 8 is empty. So moving down to (7,8) is safe. Then from there, I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,8), then next move LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards (5,5). But again, the enemy is closer to (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move LEFT first to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are moving towards (5,5). So if I go towards (5,5), I might collide with them. Or maybe not. It's hard to predict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest first move is DOWN to (7,8), then assess next steps. That way, I'm moving away from the edge and into more open space. Then from (7,8), I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut I need to collect apples to grow. So the priority is to reach an apple as soon as possible. The closest apple is (5,5), but the enemy is closer. The next closest is (2,5), but that's far. The apple at (9,3) is also far.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no safe apple to reach before the enemy, so I should just move towards an area with multiple apples, even if it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best first move is LEFT to (6,9), then continue left towards (5,9), (4,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's moving away from the apples.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Since the snake is just starting, maybe the best move is to head towards the nearest apple, even if the enemy is closer. Because if I don't collect apples, I can't grow, and the enemy might get them all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going for (9,3). So if I move towards (5,5), I can get there in 6 moves, and maybe the enemy is not going there.\n\nBut without knowing the enemy's direction, it's hard to say. So perhaps I should take the risk and head towards (5,5).\n\nSo first move: LEFT to (6,9). Then next move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nAlternatively, first move DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich is better? Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT first, I'm at (6,9). Then next move can be DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), DOWN to (5,7), etc.\n\nIf I move DOWN first, I'm at (7,8). Then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nEither way, the path is similar. But moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples earlier.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gives me more space to maneuver.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), then down, I'm on the same x-coordinate as the enemy. But they are far below, so no immediate danger.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) keeps me away from the enemy's x-coordinate.\n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN first is safer to avoid potential paths where the enemy might come up. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), they might move up towards (6,4), etc. So if I'm at (6,9), moving down, there's a lot of space between us.\n\nI think either direction is safe. But since I need to choose between LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (UP is invalid), and RIGHT leads away from apples, the best options are LEFT or DOWN.\n\nSince the apple at (5,5) is in the middle, moving LEFT or DOWN both start the journey towards it. But moving LEFT first might be better to start reducing the x-coordinate towards 5.\n\nSo I'll choose LEFT as the first move. Then next move can be DOWN. That way, I'm heading towards the center and the apple.\n\nBut wait, moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe. Then next move DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a valid path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, but moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left apples.\n\nSo the first move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (5,5) and avoid immediate danger, moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) starts the journey towards the center while staying safe. This direction positions me to continue down and left in subsequent moves, navigating towards the apple cluster. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm snake 2, starting at (7,9). The board is 10x10, with apples at (5,5), (2,5), (9,3), (2,3), (2,4). My body is empty, so I'm just the head. The enemy snake is at (6,3) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move. Since I'm at (7,9), the edges are nearby. Let's check possible moves:\n\nUP: From (7,9), moving up would take me to (7,10), which is outside the board. That's a wall, so that's instant death. So UP is not an option.\n\nDOWN: Moving down to (7,8). That's safe as long as there's no snake there. The board state shows row 9 (y=9) has me at (7,9), and row 8 (y=8) is empty. So moving down to (7,8) is okay. But where's the nearest apple?\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,5), (2,5), etc. But from (7,9), moving down to (7,8) doesn't get me closer to any apple. Maybe I should head towards the apples. Let's see the positions.\n\nThe apple at (9,3) is in the top right corner. But that's far from me. The apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are all in the left side. The apple at (5,5) is in the middle. So maybe I should go left towards the middle or left side.\n\nIf I move LEFT from (7,9), that's (6,9). Then check if that's safe. The board shows row 9 (y=9) has snake 2 at (7,9) and nothing else. So (6,9) is empty. Then moving left again would get me closer to the center. But maybe I can plan a path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is within the board. But there's no apple there. So maybe not the best choice.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I move down to (7,8), then maybe continue down towards (7,7), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving left towards (6,9), then (5,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then continue left towards the apples. The apples at (2,5) are at y=5. So from (7,8), moving down to y=7, 6, 5... but that's a few steps. Alternatively, moving left towards x=6,5,4, etc.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is at x=5, y=5. So from (7,9), moving left and down. Let's calculate the distance. The Manhattan distance from (7,9) to (5,5) is (7-5)+(9-5)=2+4=6. To get there, I need to go left twice and down four times. But that's a long path. Are there any obstacles in the way?\n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake is at (6,3). So in row 3, column 6. So if I go down towards y=5, maybe that's safe. But I need to check if moving left or down first is better.\n\nAlternatively, the apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered on the left side. Maybe those are easier to reach. The distance from (7,9) to (2,5) is (7-2)+(9-5)=5+4=9. That's a longer path, but maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe it's better to go for the closest apple first. Let's see which apple is closest. The apple at (5,5) is 6 steps away. The apple at (2,5) is 9 steps. The apple at (9,3) is (7-9= -2 in x, 9-3=6 in y) so distance 8. The apples at (2,3) and (2,4) are even further. So the closest is (5,5).\n\nSo maybe head towards (5,5). To get there, I need to move left and down. From (7,9), moving left to (6,9) then down to (6,8), etc. But each step needs to avoid walls and other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first. From (7,9), moving down to (7,8). Then left to (6,8), then down to (6,7), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). But need to check if there's any conflict with the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3), which is in the lower part. So as long as I don't go into that area, I should be safe.\n\nAnother consideration: since the enemy snake is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards the apples at (2,3) or (2,4). So if I go towards (5,5), maybe I can avoid conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,3) is in the top right. From (7,9), moving right to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's a longer path. Also, moving right from (7,9) to (8,9) is safe, but then next steps would be down towards (9,3). But that's a long way. Maybe not the best option.\n\nSo the best initial move is probably LEFT or DOWN. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), then down towards (5,8), etc. But that's moving along the top edge. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is safer? Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is far away, maybe both directions are safe. But moving LEFT first might get me closer to the center apples faster.\n\nWait, but moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is safe. Then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe moving LEFT first is better to start heading towards the apples. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) and then LEFT. Let's check if there's any immediate danger.\n\nThe board shows that the enemy snake is at (6,3), which is far from my current position. So moving LEFT or DOWN is safe. The only immediate danger is moving into a wall or another snake. Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is not in my path yet.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT. UP is invalid. So between LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT would take me to (8,9). Then next move could be RIGHT again to (9,9), but that's the edge. Then I can't go further right. So maybe not useful. Unless there's an apple there, but there's none. So RIGHT is not helpful.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better for reaching the closest apple (5,5)?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), etc. That's 4 moves to reach (5,7), then another down to (5,6), then (5,5). So total 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Same number of steps. So either way, same distance.\n\nBut maybe moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples as well. For example, after moving LEFT to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Alternatively, moving DOWN first.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I can reach it before the enemy snake, that's good. But the enemy is at (6,3), which is closer to (5,5) than I am. So maybe they will get there first. Hmm.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,3). The distance from (6,3) to (5,5) is (6-5)+(5-3)=1+2=3. So they can reach it in 3 moves. My distance is 6 moves. So they might get there first. So maybe that apple is not the best target.\n\nIn that case, maybe I should target another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered. The distance from me to (2,5) is 5 in x and 4 in y. So Manhattan distance 9. But maybe the enemy is not going for those. Let's see the enemy's position at (6,3). The distance from them to (2,5) is (6-2)+(5-3)=4+2=6. So they are 6 steps away. I'm 9 steps away. So they might still get there first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,3) is at (9,3). The enemy is at (6,3). So the enemy is 3 steps away (moving right). I'm at (7,9), so distance is (9-7)+(9-3)=2+6=8. So the enemy can reach (9,3) in 3 steps (right, right, right). But the apple is already at (9,3). Wait, the apple is already there. So if the enemy moves right three times, they can get it. But maybe they are heading that way. So perhaps that apple is not a good target for me.\n\nSo maybe the best option is to go for the apple at (5,5) even if the enemy is closer. But since the enemy is at (6,3), they might reach it first. So maybe I should look for another apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a path to collect multiple apples. For example, if I go towards the cluster at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), I can collect them in sequence. But that's a long way. Let's see the path.\n\nFrom (7,9), moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5). Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's recalculate.\n\nFrom (7,9), move left to (6,9) (1), down to (6,8) (2), left to (5,8) (3), down to (5,7) (4), down to (5,6) (5), down to (5,5) (6). So 6 moves to reach (5,5). But the enemy is 3 moves away. So they would get there first. So maybe that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going towards (2,3) or (9,3). But I can't know for sure. So perhaps I should target an apple that's less contested.\n\nLooking at the apples, (9,3) is in the enemy's vicinity, so they might go for that. The apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are in the left. Maybe I can head there. But it's a long path. Alternatively, maybe there's a safer apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is at (2,5). From my position (7,9), moving left and down. Let's see the path. Moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5) which I could collect on the way. Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's see:\n\nFrom (7,9) to (5,5): 6 moves. Then from (5,5) to (2,5): 3 moves left. So total 9 moves. But again, the enemy might get (5,5) first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (2,5) directly. But that's a long way. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to head towards the nearest apple that's not in the enemy's immediate path. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards (9,3) or (2,3). If they go right, they can reach (9,3) in 3 moves. If they go left, they can reach (2,3) in 4 moves. So maybe they are going for (9,3). So perhaps I should avoid that area.\n\nIn that case, maybe the apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are safer. But again, it's a long path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just start moving towards the center to have more options. Let's think about the first move.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next turn I can move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards the center. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is better? Both are safe. Maybe moving LEFT first to start heading towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to get away from the top edge. Since being on the edge can limit movement options. If I move DOWN to (7,8), I'm one step away from the edge. Then I can move LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), that's the same x-coordinate as the enemy, but far away. So no conflict.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) is safe.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best initial move is LEFT to start heading towards the apples on the left. Then next moves can be down and left towards (5,5) or (2,5). But I need to make sure I don't get trapped.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) gives me more space. Let's see the board again.\n\nThe board shows that row 9 (y=9) has me at (7,9). Row 8 is empty. So moving down to (7,8) is safe. Then from there, I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,8), then next move LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards (5,5). But again, the enemy is closer to (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move LEFT first to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are moving towards (5,5). So if I go towards (5,5), I might collide with them. Or maybe not. It's hard to predict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest first move is DOWN to (7,8), then assess next steps. That way, I'm moving away from the edge and into more open space. Then from (7,8), I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut I need to collect apples to grow. So the priority is to reach an apple as soon as possible. The closest apple is (5,5), but the enemy is closer. The next closest is (2,5), but that's far. The apple at (9,3) is also far.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no safe apple to reach before the enemy, so I should just move towards an area with multiple apples, even if it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best first move is LEFT to (6,9), then continue left towards (5,9), (4,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's moving away from the apples.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Since the snake is just starting, maybe the best move is to head towards the nearest apple, even if the enemy is closer. Because if I don't collect apples, I can't grow, and the enemy might get them all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going for (9,3). So if I move towards (5,5), I can get there in 6 moves, and maybe the enemy is not going there.\n\nBut without knowing the enemy's direction, it's hard to say. So perhaps I should take the risk and head towards (5,5).\n\nSo first move: LEFT to (6,9). Then next move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nAlternatively, first move DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich is better? Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT first, I'm at (6,9). Then next move can be DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), DOWN to (5,7), etc.\n\nIf I move DOWN first, I'm at (7,8). Then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nEither way, the path is similar. But moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples earlier.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gives me more space to maneuver.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), then down, I'm on the same x-coordinate as the enemy. But they are far below, so no immediate danger.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) keeps me away from the enemy's x-coordinate.\n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN first is safer to avoid potential paths where the enemy might come up. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), they might move up towards (6,4), etc. So if I'm at (6,9), moving down, there's a lot of space between us.\n\nI think either direction is safe. But since I need to choose between LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (UP is invalid), and RIGHT leads away from apples, the best options are LEFT or DOWN.\n\nSince the apple at (5,5) is in the middle, moving LEFT or DOWN both start the journey towards it. But moving LEFT first might be better to start reducing the x-coordinate towards 5.\n\nSo I'll choose LEFT as the first move. Then next move can be DOWN. That way, I'm heading towards the center and the apple.\n\nBut wait, moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe. Then next move DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a valid path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, but moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left apples.\n\nSo the first move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (5,5) and avoid immediate danger, moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) starts the journey towards the center while staying safe. This direction positions me to continue down and left in subsequent moves, navigating towards the apple cluster. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (6,4) with an empty body. The board hasn't changed much except for my new position.\n\nPossible moves from (6,9):\n- UP: (6,10) which is out of bounds. Not possible.\n- DOWN: (6,8). Safe, as the board shows row 8 (y=8) is empty.\n- LEFT: (5,9). Safe, as row 9 (y=9) has no obstacles there.\n- RIGHT: (7,9).

From (6,9), moving DOWN to (6,8) gets me closer. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (5,9) continues along the top edge but doesn't directly approach the apple. \n\nIf I move DOWN to (6,8), the next steps could be LEFT to (5,8), then DOWN towards (5,5).

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,5) with an empty body. The board shows that row 8 has my snake at (6,8), and the enemy is at (6,5) in row 5.\n\nPossible moves from (6,8):\n- UP: (6,9) which is where I was before. But moving back might not be good since there's no apple there, and it's just empty. But since my body is empty, it's safe. However, that's moving away from the apples.\n- DOWN: (6,7). That's moving towards the center where the apples are. From (6,7), I can continue down towards (6,6), getting closer to (5,5).\n- LEFT: (5,8). Moving left towards the left side of the board. From there, maybe head down towards (5,5) which is an apple. That seems like a possible path.\n- RIGHT: (7,8). Moving right, but that's away from the apples. The rightmost apple is at (9,3), which is far. Not sure if that's the best direction.\n\nThe closest apple is (5,5). To get there from (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8) then DOWN to (5,7), (5,6), (5,5) would take 3 moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), etc. Either way, similar steps. But moving LEFT first might position me better to avoid the enemy snake at (6,5). The enemy is at (6,5), which is directly below their previous position. They might be heading towards (5,5) as well. If I move LEFT to (5,8), I can start a path that's more direct and possibly avoid collision with the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If they move left to (5,5), they can take that apple. So maybe I need to get there first. But from (6,8), moving LEFT and then down would take 3 moves. The enemy is at (6,5), which is 3 moves away from (5,5) (left once to 5,5). So if I move LEFT now, then next turn I can go down, but the enemy might reach the apple first. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) would take 4 moves. That's longer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,3), (2,4) are clustered on the left. Maybe the enemy is heading there. But their current position is (6,5), so they might go left towards (5,5) or further left. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), then next move DOWN to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. The enemy is at (6,5), so if they move LEFT to (5,5) in one move, they can take the apple. So I need to get there before them. But I can't reach it in one move. So maybe that apple is already going to be taken by the enemy. Maybe I should target another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are in a cluster. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), etc., but that's a long way. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT towards (5,7), but that's still not close. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,3) is on the right. If I move RIGHT to (7,8), then continue right and down towards (9,3). But that's a longer path. Maybe less contested. The enemy is at (6,5), so they might not be heading that way. \n\nBut the enemy's body is empty, so they can move freely. They might be going for the closest apple, which is (5,5). If I can't beat them to it, maybe I should go for another apple. The apples at (2,5) are also possible. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc., but that's a lot of steps. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). If they are at (6,5), they could move UP to (6,6), but that's away from the apple. Or they could move LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. So if I move LEFT now to (5,8), and the enemy moves LEFT to (5,5), they take the apple. But if I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5), but that's three moves. The enemy can take it in one move. So maybe (5,5) is not the best target. \n\nLooking at the other apples: (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc. That's a long way. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), etc. Still a lot. \n\nThe apple at (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. From (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then RIGHT to (9,8), then DOWN to (9,7), etc. That's a long path. \n\nThe apples at (2,3) and (2,4) are also on the left. Maybe the enemy is heading there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should focus on the closest apple that's not contested. The apple at (5,5) is contested. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered. Maybe if I head towards them, but it's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards (5,5), so I should avoid that and go for another apple. Let's see. If I move LEFT to (5,8), then next move LEFT to (4,8), then DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), etc. But that's a lot. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). Maybe they are moving in another direction. Since their body is empty, they can't block themselves. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe the best move is to continue moving DOWN to (6,7) to get closer to the center, then plan the next move. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) to start heading west towards the cluster of apples. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But the enemy might take (5,5) first. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). Let's check their position. They were at (6,5) in the current board. If they move LEFT, they get to (5,5) and eat the apple. So if they do that, then that apple is gone. But if they move in another direction, maybe I can get there. \n\nBut since I can't predict the enemy's move, I have to assume they might take the apple. So maybe it's better to target another apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then DOWN to (2,5). That's 6 moves. That's a lot. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then DOWN to (2,5). Also 6 moves. \n\nThe apple at (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. From (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then RIGHT to (9,8), then DOWN to (9,7), then DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4), then DOWN to (9,3). That's 7 moves. \n\nThe apple at (2,3) is even lower. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best option is to go for the apple at (5,5) even if there's a risk. If the enemy takes it, then I can go for another. But if I don't try, I might miss out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take a different path. Let's see. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. The enemy is at (6,5). If they move LEFT to (5,5) next turn, they take it. So if I move LEFT now, then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then the enemy takes (5,5). Then I can't get that apple. \n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). The enemy could take (5,5) before I get there. \n\nSo maybe (5,5) is too risky. Let's look at other apples. The apple at (2,5) is in the same y=5 row as the enemy's current position. If the enemy is moving left, they might go towards (5,5) or further left. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should head towards the cluster of apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). But that's a long way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards (2,5) as well. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best move is to start moving towards the left side where there are multiple apples, even if it's a longer path. So moving LEFT to (5,8) to start heading west. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7) to get closer to the center. \n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move DOWN to (6,6), then I'm at (6,6), which is one above the enemy's position. If the enemy moves UP to (6,6), that's a collision. But since their body is empty, they can move freely. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) avoids the enemy's path. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving LEFT to (5,8) is safer and starts a path towards the left side apples. \n\nBut I need to make sure I don't get stuck. Since my body is empty, I can turn around if needed. \n\nSo, possible moves:\n\nLEFT to (5,8): safe, starts moving west.\n\nDOWN to (6,7): safe, moves towards center.\n\nUP to (6,9): safe, but not helpful.\n\nRIGHT to (7,8): safe, but moves east.\n\nThe best options are LEFT or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT, I can start heading towards the left apples. If I choose DOWN, I get closer to the center and maybe the (5,5) apple. \n\nBut given the enemy's position, maybe LEFT is better to avoid potential conflict. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7) and then LEFT to (5,7) could be a path. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are moving in another direction. \n\nIn the absence of information about the enemy's next move, I have to assume they might go for the closest apple. \n\nSo, if I move LEFT to (5,8), then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), etc. \n\nI think moving LEFT to (5,8) is a better strategic move to start heading towards the cluster of apples on the left. Even though it's a longer path, it might be safer and less contested. \n\nSo, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm snake 2, starting at (7,9). The board is 10x10, with apples at (5,5), (2,5), (9,3), (2,3), (2,4). My body is empty, so I'm just the head. The enemy snake is at (6,3) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move. Since I'm at (7,9), the edges are nearby. Let's check possible moves:\n\nUP: From (7,9), moving up would take me to (7,10), which is outside the board. That's a wall, so that's instant death. So UP is not an option.\n\nDOWN: Moving down to (7,8). That's safe as long as there's no snake there. The board state shows row 9 (y=9) has me at (7,9), and row 8 (y=8) is empty. So moving down to (7,8) is okay. But where's the nearest apple?\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,5), (2,5), etc. But from (7,9), moving down to (7,8) doesn't get me closer to any apple. Maybe I should head towards the apples. Let's see the positions.\n\nThe apple at (9,3) is in the top right corner. But that's far from me. The apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are all in the left side. The apple at (5,5) is in the middle. So maybe I should go left towards the middle or left side.\n\nIf I move LEFT from (7,9), that's (6,9). Then check if that's safe. The board shows row 9 (y=9) has snake 2 at (7,9) and nothing else. So (6,9) is empty. Then moving left again would get me closer to the center. But maybe I can plan a path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is within the board. But there's no apple there. So maybe not the best choice.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I move down to (7,8), then maybe continue down towards (7,7), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving left towards (6,9), then (5,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then continue left towards the apples. The apples at (2,5) are at y=5. So from (7,8), moving down to y=7, 6, 5... but that's a few steps. Alternatively, moving left towards x=6,5,4, etc.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is at x=5, y=5. So from (7,9), moving left and down. Let's calculate the distance. The Manhattan distance from (7,9) to (5,5) is (7-5)+(9-5)=2+4=6. To get there, I need to go left twice and down four times. But that's a long path. Are there any obstacles in the way?\n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake is at (6,3). So in row 3, column 6. So if I go down towards y=5, maybe that's safe. But I need to check if moving left or down first is better.\n\nAlternatively, the apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered on the left side. Maybe those are easier to reach. The distance from (7,9) to (2,5) is (7-2)+(9-5)=5+4=9. That's a longer path, but maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe it's better to go for the closest apple first. Let's see which apple is closest. The apple at (5,5) is 6 steps away. The apple at (2,5) is 9 steps. The apple at (9,3) is (7-9= -2 in x, 9-3=6 in y) so distance 8. The apples at (2,3) and (2,4) are even further. So the closest is (5,5).\n\nSo maybe head towards (5,5). To get there, I need to move left and down. From (7,9), moving left to (6,9) then down to (6,8), etc. But each step needs to avoid walls and other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first. From (7,9), moving down to (7,8). Then left to (6,8), then down to (6,7), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). But need to check if there's any conflict with the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3), which is in the lower part. So as long as I don't go into that area, I should be safe.\n\nAnother consideration: since the enemy snake is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards the apples at (2,3) or (2,4). So if I go towards (5,5), maybe I can avoid conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,3) is in the top right. From (7,9), moving right to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's a longer path. Also, moving right from (7,9) to (8,9) is safe, but then next steps would be down towards (9,3). But that's a long way. Maybe not the best option.\n\nSo the best initial move is probably LEFT or DOWN. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), then down towards (5,8), etc. But that's moving along the top edge. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is safer? Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is far away, maybe both directions are safe. But moving LEFT first might get me closer to the center apples faster.\n\nWait, but moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is safe. Then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe moving LEFT first is better to start heading towards the apples. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) and then LEFT. Let's check if there's any immediate danger.\n\nThe board shows that the enemy snake is at (6,3), which is far from my current position. So moving LEFT or DOWN is safe. The only immediate danger is moving into a wall or another snake. Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is not in my path yet.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT. UP is invalid. So between LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT would take me to (8,9). Then next move could be RIGHT again to (9,9), but that's the edge. Then I can't go further right. So maybe not useful. Unless there's an apple there, but there's none. So RIGHT is not helpful.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better for reaching the closest apple (5,5)?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), etc. That's 4 moves to reach (5,7), then another down to (5,6), then (5,5). So total 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Same number of steps. So either way, same distance.\n\nBut maybe moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples as well. For example, after moving LEFT to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Alternatively, moving DOWN first.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I can reach it before the enemy snake, that's good. But the enemy is at (6,3), which is closer to (5,5) than I am. So maybe they will get there first. Hmm.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,3). The distance from (6,3) to (5,5) is (6-5)+(5-3)=1+2=3. So they can reach it in 3 moves. My distance is 6 moves. So they might get there first. So maybe that apple is not the best target.\n\nIn that case, maybe I should target another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered. The distance from me to (2,5) is 5 in x and 4 in y. So Manhattan distance 9. But maybe the enemy is not going for those. Let's see the enemy's position at (6,3). The distance from them to (2,5) is (6-2)+(5-3)=4+2=6. So they are 6 steps away. I'm 9 steps away. So they might still get there first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,3) is at (9,3). The enemy is at (6,3). So the enemy is 3 steps away (moving right). I'm at (7,9), so distance is (9-7)+(9-3)=2+6=8. So the enemy can reach (9,3) in 3 steps (right, right, right). But the apple is already at (9,3). Wait, the apple is already there. So if the enemy moves right three times, they can get it. But maybe they are heading that way. So perhaps that apple is not a good target for me.\n\nSo maybe the best option is to go for the apple at (5,5) even if the enemy is closer. But since the enemy is at (6,3), they might reach it first. So maybe I should look for another apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a path to collect multiple apples. For example, if I go towards the cluster at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), I can collect them in sequence. But that's a long way. Let's see the path.\n\nFrom (7,9), moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5). Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's recalculate.\n\nFrom (7,9), move left to (6,9) (1), down to (6,8) (2), left to (5,8) (3), down to (5,7) (4), down to (5,6) (5), down to (5,5) (6). So 6 moves to reach (5,5). But the enemy is 3 moves away. So they would get there first. So maybe that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going towards (2,3) or (9,3). But I can't know for sure. So perhaps I should target an apple that's less contested.\n\nLooking at the apples, (9,3) is in the enemy's vicinity, so they might go for that. The apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are in the left. Maybe I can head there. But it's a long path. Alternatively, maybe there's a safer apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is at (2,5). From my position (7,9), moving left and down. Let's see the path. Moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5) which I could collect on the way. Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's see:\n\nFrom (7,9) to (5,5): 6 moves. Then from (5,5) to (2,5): 3 moves left. So total 9 moves. But again, the enemy might get (5,5) first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (2,5) directly. But that's a long way. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to head towards the nearest apple that's not in the enemy's immediate path. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards (9,3) or (2,3). If they go right, they can reach (9,3) in 3 moves. If they go left, they can reach (2,3) in 4 moves. So maybe they are going for (9,3). So perhaps I should avoid that area.\n\nIn that case, maybe the apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are safer. But again, it's a long path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just start moving towards the center to have more options. Let's think about the first move.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next turn I can move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards the center. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is better? Both are safe. Maybe moving LEFT first to start heading towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to get away from the top edge. Since being on the edge can limit movement options. If I move DOWN to (7,8), I'm one step away from the edge. Then I can move LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), that's the same x-coordinate as the enemy, but far away. So no conflict.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) is safe.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best initial move is LEFT to start heading towards the apples on the left. Then next moves can be down and left towards (5,5) or (2,5). But I need to make sure I don't get trapped.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) gives me more space. Let's see the board again.\n\nThe board shows that row 9 (y=9) has me at (7,9). Row 8 is empty. So moving down to (7,8) is safe. Then from there, I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,8), then next move LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards (5,5). But again, the enemy is closer to (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move LEFT first to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are moving towards (5,5). So if I go towards (5,5), I might collide with them. Or maybe not. It's hard to predict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest first move is DOWN to (7,8), then assess next steps. That way, I'm moving away from the edge and into more open space. Then from (7,8), I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut I need to collect apples to grow. So the priority is to reach an apple as soon as possible. The closest apple is (5,5), but the enemy is closer. The next closest is (2,5), but that's far. The apple at (9,3) is also far.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no safe apple to reach before the enemy, so I should just move towards an area with multiple apples, even if it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best first move is LEFT to (6,9), then continue left towards (5,9), (4,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's moving away from the apples.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Since the snake is just starting, maybe the best move is to head towards the nearest apple, even if the enemy is closer. Because if I don't collect apples, I can't grow, and the enemy might get them all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going for (9,3). So if I move towards (5,5), I can get there in 6 moves, and maybe the enemy is not going there.\n\nBut without knowing the enemy's direction, it's hard to say. So perhaps I should take the risk and head towards (5,5).\n\nSo first move: LEFT to (6,9). Then next move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nAlternatively, first move DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich is better? Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT first, I'm at (6,9). Then next move can be DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), DOWN to (5,7), etc.\n\nIf I move DOWN first, I'm at (7,8). Then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nEither way, the path is similar. But moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples earlier.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gives me more space to maneuver.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), then down, I'm on the same x-coordinate as the enemy. But they are far below, so no immediate danger.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) keeps me away from the enemy's x-coordinate.\n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN first is safer to avoid potential paths where the enemy might come up. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), they might move up towards (6,4), etc. So if I'm at (6,9), moving down, there's a lot of space between us.\n\nI think either direction is safe. But since I need to choose between LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (UP is invalid), and RIGHT leads away from apples, the best options are LEFT or DOWN.\n\nSince the apple at (5,5) is in the middle, moving LEFT or DOWN both start the journey towards it. But moving LEFT first might be better to start reducing the x-coordinate towards 5.\n\nSo I'll choose LEFT as the first move. Then next move can be DOWN. That way, I'm heading towards the center and the apple.\n\nBut wait, moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe. Then next move DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a valid path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, but moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left apples.\n\nSo the first move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (5,5) and avoid immediate danger, moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) starts the journey towards the center while staying safe. This direction positions me to continue down and left in subsequent moves, navigating towards the apple cluster. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (6,4) with an empty body. The board hasn't changed much except for my new position.\n\nPossible moves from (6,9):\n- UP: (6,10) which is out of bounds.

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,5) with an empty body. The board shows that row 8 has my snake at (6,8), and the enemy is at (6,5) in row 5.\n\nPossible moves from (6,8):\n- UP: (6,9) which is where I was before. But moving back might not be good since there's no apple there, and it's just empty. But since my body is empty, it's safe. However, that's moving away from the apples.\n- DOWN: (6,7). That's moving towards the center where the apples are. From (6,7), I can continue down towards (6,6), getting closer to (5,5).\n- LEFT: (5,8). Moving left towards the left side of the board. From there, maybe head down towards (5,5) which is an apple. That seems like a possible path.\n- RIGHT: (7,8). Moving right, but that's away from the apples. The rightmost apple is at (9,3), which is far. Not sure if that's the best direction.\n\nThe closest apple is (5,5). To get there from (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8) then DOWN to (5,7), (5,6), (5,5) would take 3 moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), etc. Either way, similar steps. But moving LEFT first might position me better to avoid the enemy snake at (6,5). The enemy is at (6,5), which is directly below their previous position. They might be heading towards (5,5) as well. If I move LEFT to (5,8), I can start a path that's more direct and possibly avoid collision with the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If they move left to (5,5), they can take that apple. So maybe I need to get there first. But from (6,8), moving LEFT and then down would take 3 moves. The enemy is at (6,5), which is 3 moves away from (5,5) (left once to 5,5). So if I move LEFT now, then next turn I can go down, but the enemy might reach the apple first. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) would take 4 moves. That's longer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,3), (2,4) are clustered on the left. Maybe the enemy is heading there. But their current position is (6,5), so they might go left towards (5,5) or further left. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), then next move DOWN to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. The enemy is at (6,5), so if they move LEFT to (5,5) in one move, they can take the apple. So I need to get there before them. But I can't reach it in one move. So maybe that apple is already going to be taken by the enemy. Maybe I should target another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are in a cluster. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), etc., but that's a long way. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT towards (5,7), but that's still not close. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,3) is on the right. If I move RIGHT to (7,8), then continue right and down towards (9,3). But that's a longer path. Maybe less contested. The enemy is at (6,5), so they might not be heading that way. \n\nBut the enemy's body is empty, so they can move freely. They might be going for the closest apple, which is (5,5). If I can't beat them to it, maybe I should go for another apple. The apples at (2,5) are also possible. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc., but that's a lot of steps. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). If they are at (6,5), they could move UP to (6,6), but that's away from the apple. Or they could move LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. So if I move LEFT now to (5,8), and the enemy moves LEFT to (5,5), they take the apple. But if I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5), but that's three moves. The enemy can take it in one move. So maybe (5,5) is not the best target. \n\nLooking at the other apples: (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc. That's a long way. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), etc. Still a lot. \n\nThe apple at (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. From (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then RIGHT to (9,8), then DOWN to (9,7), etc. That's a long path. \n\nThe apples at (2,3) and (2,4) are also on the left. Maybe the enemy is heading there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should focus on the closest apple that's not contested. The apple at (5,5) is contested. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered. Maybe if I head towards them, but it's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards (5,5), so I should avoid that and go for another apple. Let's see. If I move LEFT to (5,8), then next move LEFT to (4,8), then DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), etc. But that's a lot. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). Maybe they are moving in another direction. Since their body is empty, they can't block themselves. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe the best move is to continue moving DOWN to (6,7) to get closer to the center, then plan the next move. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) to start heading west towards the cluster of apples. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But the enemy might take (5,5) first. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). Let's check their position. They were at (6,5) in the current board. If they move LEFT, they get to (5,5) and eat the apple. So if they do that, then that apple is gone. But if they move in another direction, maybe I can get there. \n\nBut since I can't predict the enemy's move, I have to assume they might take the apple. So maybe it's better to target another apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then DOWN to (2,5). That's 6 moves. That's a lot. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then DOWN to (2,5). Also 6 moves. \n\nThe apple at (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. From (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then RIGHT to (9,8), then DOWN to (9,7), then DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4), then DOWN to (9,3). That's 7 moves. \n\nThe apple at (2,3) is even lower. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best option is to go for the apple at (5,5) even if there's a risk. If the enemy takes it, then I can go for another. But if I don't try, I might miss out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take a different path. Let's see. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. The enemy is at (6,5). If they move LEFT to (5,5) next turn, they take it. So if I move LEFT now, then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then the enemy takes (5,5). Then I can't get that apple. \n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). The enemy could take (5,5) before I get there. \n\nSo maybe (5,5) is too risky. Let's look at other apples. The apple at (2,5) is in the same y=5 row as the enemy's current position. If the enemy is moving left, they might go towards (5,5) or further left. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should head towards the cluster of apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). But that's a long way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards (2,5) as well. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best move is to start moving towards the left side where there are multiple apples, even if it's a longer path. So moving LEFT to (5,8) to start heading west. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7) to get closer to the center. \n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move DOWN to (6,6), then I'm at (6,6), which is one above the enemy's position. If the enemy moves UP to (6,6), that's a collision. But since their body is empty, they can move freely. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) avoids the enemy's path. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving LEFT to (5,8) is safer and starts a path towards the left side apples. \n\nBut I need to make sure I don't get stuck. Since my body is empty, I can turn around if needed. \n\nSo, possible moves:\n\nLEFT to (5,8): safe, starts moving west.\n\nDOWN to (6,7): safe, moves towards center.\n\nUP to (6,9): safe, but not helpful.\n\nRIGHT to (7,8): safe, but moves east.\n\nThe best options are LEFT or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT, I can start heading towards the left apples. If I choose DOWN, I get closer to the center and maybe the (5,5) apple. \n\nBut given the enemy's position, maybe LEFT is better to avoid potential conflict. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7) and then LEFT to (5,7) could be a path. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are moving in another direction. \n\nIn the absence of information about the enemy's next move, I have to assume they might go for the closest apple. \n\nSo, if I move LEFT to (5,8), then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), etc. \n\nI think moving LEFT to (5,8) is a better strategic move to start heading towards the cluster of apples on the left. Even though it's a longer path, it might be safer and less contested. \n\nSo, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,5). My body is empty, so I can move freely without collision risks except with the enemy or walls.\n\nPossible moves from (5,8):\n- UP: (5,9) \u2013 edge of the board. Moving here is safe but doesn't help reach apples.\n- DOWN: (5,7) \u2013 moving towards the center and closer to the (5,5) apple.\n- LEFT: (4,8) \u2013 continues west towards the cluster of apples on the left.\n- RIGHT: (6,8) \u2013 back to previous position, which is safe but not productive.\n\nThe closest apple is (5,5). From (5,8), moving DOWN three times would reach it. However, the enemy at (6,5) is one move away from (5,5). If they move LEFT next turn, they'll take the apple. So competing for (5,5) might be risky. \n\nAlternatively, heading towards the left cluster (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) could be safer. From (5,8), moving LEFT to (4,8) then down and left repeatedly.

Moving LEFT now starts that path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (5,7) gets closer to the center, allowing flexibility. But the enemy's proximity to (5,5) makes it uncertain. \n\nSince the enemy might take (5,5), focusing on the left cluster seems better. Moving LEFT to (4,8) continues the westward path, aligning with that strategy.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "move": "LEFT",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm snake 2, starting at (7,9). The board is 10x10, with apples at (5,5), (2,5), (9,3), (2,3), (2,4). My body is empty, so I'm just the head. The enemy snake is at (6,3) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move. Since I'm at (7,9), the edges are nearby. Let's check possible moves:\n\nUP: From (7,9), moving up would take me to (7,10), which is outside the board. That's a wall, so that's instant death. So UP is not an option.\n\nDOWN: Moving down to (7,8). That's safe as long as there's no snake there. The board state shows row 9 (y=9) has me at (7,9), and row 8 (y=8) is empty. So moving down to (7,8) is okay. But where's the nearest apple?\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,5), (2,5), etc. But from (7,9), moving down to (7,8) doesn't get me closer to any apple. Maybe I should head towards the apples. Let's see the positions.\n\nThe apple at (9,3) is in the top right corner. But that's far from me. The apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are all in the left side. The apple at (5,5) is in the middle. So maybe I should go left towards the middle or left side.\n\nIf I move LEFT from (7,9), that's (6,9). Then check if that's safe. The board shows row 9 (y=9) has snake 2 at (7,9) and nothing else. So (6,9) is empty. Then moving left again would get me closer to the center. But maybe I can plan a path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is within the board. But there's no apple there. So maybe not the best choice.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I move down to (7,8), then maybe continue down towards (7,7), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving left towards (6,9), then (5,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then continue left towards the apples. The apples at (2,5) are at y=5. So from (7,8), moving down to y=7, 6, 5... but that's a few steps. Alternatively, moving left towards x=6,5,4, etc.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is at x=5, y=5. So from (7,9), moving left and down. Let's calculate the distance. The Manhattan distance from (7,9) to (5,5) is (7-5)+(9-5)=2+4=6. To get there, I need to go left twice and down four times. But that's a long path. Are there any obstacles in the way?\n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake is at (6,3). So in row 3, column 6. So if I go down towards y=5, maybe that's safe. But I need to check if moving left or down first is better.\n\nAlternatively, the apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered on the left side. Maybe those are easier to reach. The distance from (7,9) to (2,5) is (7-2)+(9-5)=5+4=9. That's a longer path, but maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe it's better to go for the closest apple first. Let's see which apple is closest. The apple at (5,5) is 6 steps away. The apple at (2,5) is 9 steps. The apple at (9,3) is (7-9= -2 in x, 9-3=6 in y) so distance 8. The apples at (2,3) and (2,4) are even further. So the closest is (5,5).\n\nSo maybe head towards (5,5). To get there, I need to move left and down. From (7,9), moving left to (6,9) then down to (6,8), etc. But each step needs to avoid walls and other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first. From (7,9), moving down to (7,8). Then left to (6,8), then down to (6,7), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). But need to check if there's any conflict with the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3), which is in the lower part. So as long as I don't go into that area, I should be safe.\n\nAnother consideration: since the enemy snake is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards the apples at (2,3) or (2,4). So if I go towards (5,5), maybe I can avoid conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,3) is in the top right. From (7,9), moving right to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's a longer path. Also, moving right from (7,9) to (8,9) is safe, but then next steps would be down towards (9,3). But that's a long way. Maybe not the best option.\n\nSo the best initial move is probably LEFT or DOWN. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), then down towards (5,8), etc. But that's moving along the top edge. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is safer? Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is far away, maybe both directions are safe. But moving LEFT first might get me closer to the center apples faster.\n\nWait, but moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is safe. Then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe moving LEFT first is better to start heading towards the apples. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) and then LEFT. Let's check if there's any immediate danger.\n\nThe board shows that the enemy snake is at (6,3), which is far from my current position. So moving LEFT or DOWN is safe. The only immediate danger is moving into a wall or another snake. Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is not in my path yet.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT. UP is invalid. So between LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT would take me to (8,9). Then next move could be RIGHT again to (9,9), but that's the edge. Then I can't go further right. So maybe not useful. Unless there's an apple there, but there's none. So RIGHT is not helpful.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better for reaching the closest apple (5,5)?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), etc. That's 4 moves to reach (5,7), then another down to (5,6), then (5,5). So total 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Same number of steps. So either way, same distance.\n\nBut maybe moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples as well. For example, after moving LEFT to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Alternatively, moving DOWN first.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I can reach it before the enemy snake, that's good. But the enemy is at (6,3), which is closer to (5,5) than I am. So maybe they will get there first. Hmm.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,3). The distance from (6,3) to (5,5) is (6-5)+(5-3)=1+2=3. So they can reach it in 3 moves. My distance is 6 moves. So they might get there first. So maybe that apple is not the best target.\n\nIn that case, maybe I should target another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered. The distance from me to (2,5) is 5 in x and 4 in y. So Manhattan distance 9. But maybe the enemy is not going for those. Let's see the enemy's position at (6,3). The distance from them to (2,5) is (6-2)+(5-3)=4+2=6. So they are 6 steps away. I'm 9 steps away. So they might still get there first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,3) is at (9,3). The enemy is at (6,3). So the enemy is 3 steps away (moving right). I'm at (7,9), so distance is (9-7)+(9-3)=2+6=8. So the enemy can reach (9,3) in 3 steps (right, right, right). But the apple is already at (9,3). Wait, the apple is already there. So if the enemy moves right three times, they can get it. But maybe they are heading that way. So perhaps that apple is not a good target for me.\n\nSo maybe the best option is to go for the apple at (5,5) even if the enemy is closer. But since the enemy is at (6,3), they might reach it first. So maybe I should look for another apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a path to collect multiple apples. For example, if I go towards the cluster at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), I can collect them in sequence. But that's a long way. Let's see the path.\n\nFrom (7,9), moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5). Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's recalculate.\n\nFrom (7,9), move left to (6,9) (1), down to (6,8) (2), left to (5,8) (3), down to (5,7) (4), down to (5,6) (5), down to (5,5) (6). So 6 moves to reach (5,5). But the enemy is 3 moves away. So they would get there first. So maybe that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going towards (2,3) or (9,3). But I can't know for sure. So perhaps I should target an apple that's less contested.\n\nLooking at the apples, (9,3) is in the enemy's vicinity, so they might go for that. The apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are in the left. Maybe I can head there. But it's a long path. Alternatively, maybe there's a safer apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is at (2,5). From my position (7,9), moving left and down. Let's see the path. Moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5) which I could collect on the way. Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's see:\n\nFrom (7,9) to (5,5): 6 moves. Then from (5,5) to (2,5): 3 moves left. So total 9 moves. But again, the enemy might get (5,5) first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (2,5) directly. But that's a long way. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to head towards the nearest apple that's not in the enemy's immediate path. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards (9,3) or (2,3). If they go right, they can reach (9,3) in 3 moves. If they go left, they can reach (2,3) in 4 moves. So maybe they are going for (9,3). So perhaps I should avoid that area.\n\nIn that case, maybe the apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are safer. But again, it's a long path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just start moving towards the center to have more options. Let's think about the first move.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next turn I can move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards the center. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is better? Both are safe. Maybe moving LEFT first to start heading towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to get away from the top edge. Since being on the edge can limit movement options. If I move DOWN to (7,8), I'm one step away from the edge. Then I can move LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), that's the same x-coordinate as the enemy, but far away. So no conflict.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) is safe.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best initial move is LEFT to start heading towards the apples on the left. Then next moves can be down and left towards (5,5) or (2,5). But I need to make sure I don't get trapped.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) gives me more space. Let's see the board again.\n\nThe board shows that row 9 (y=9) has me at (7,9). Row 8 is empty. So moving down to (7,8) is safe. Then from there, I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,8), then next move LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards (5,5). But again, the enemy is closer to (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move LEFT first to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are moving towards (5,5). So if I go towards (5,5), I might collide with them. Or maybe not. It's hard to predict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest first move is DOWN to (7,8), then assess next steps. That way, I'm moving away from the edge and into more open space. Then from (7,8), I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut I need to collect apples to grow. So the priority is to reach an apple as soon as possible. The closest apple is (5,5), but the enemy is closer. The next closest is (2,5), but that's far. The apple at (9,3) is also far.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no safe apple to reach before the enemy, so I should just move towards an area with multiple apples, even if it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best first move is LEFT to (6,9), then continue left towards (5,9), (4,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's moving away from the apples.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Since the snake is just starting, maybe the best move is to head towards the nearest apple, even if the enemy is closer. Because if I don't collect apples, I can't grow, and the enemy might get them all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going for (9,3). So if I move towards (5,5), I can get there in 6 moves, and maybe the enemy is not going there.\n\nBut without knowing the enemy's direction, it's hard to say. So perhaps I should take the risk and head towards (5,5).\n\nSo first move: LEFT to (6,9). Then next move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nAlternatively, first move DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich is better? Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT first, I'm at (6,9). Then next move can be DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), DOWN to (5,7), etc.\n\nIf I move DOWN first, I'm at (7,8). Then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nEither way, the path is similar. But moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples earlier.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gives me more space to maneuver.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), then down, I'm on the same x-coordinate as the enemy. But they are far below, so no immediate danger.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) keeps me away from the enemy's x-coordinate.\n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN first is safer to avoid potential paths where the enemy might come up. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), they might move up towards (6,4), etc. So if I'm at (6,9), moving down, there's a lot of space between us.\n\nI think either direction is safe. But since I need to choose between LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (UP is invalid), and RIGHT leads away from apples, the best options are LEFT or DOWN.\n\nSince the apple at (5,5) is in the middle, moving LEFT or DOWN both start the journey towards it. But moving LEFT first might be better to start reducing the x-coordinate towards 5.\n\nSo I'll choose LEFT as the first move. Then next move can be DOWN. That way, I'm heading towards the center and the apple.\n\nBut wait, moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe. Then next move DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a valid path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, but moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left apples.\n\nSo the first move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (5,5) and avoid immediate danger, moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) starts the journey towards the center while staying safe. This direction positions me to continue down and left in subsequent moves, navigating towards the apple cluster. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (6,4) with an empty body. The board hasn't changed much except for my new position.\n\nPossible moves from (6,9):\n- UP: (6,10) which is out of bounds.

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,5) with an empty body. The board shows that row 8 has my snake at (6,8), and the enemy is at (6,5) in row 5.\n\nPossible moves from (6,8):\n- UP: (6,9) which is where I was before. But moving back might not be good since there's no apple there, and it's just empty. But since my body is empty, it's safe. However, that's moving away from the apples.\n- DOWN: (6,7). That's moving towards the center where the apples are. From (6,7), I can continue down towards (6,6), getting closer to (5,5).\n- LEFT: (5,8). Moving left towards the left side of the board. From there, maybe head down towards (5,5) which is an apple. That seems like a possible path.\n- RIGHT: (7,8). Moving right, but that's away from the apples. The rightmost apple is at (9,3), which is far. Not sure if that's the best direction.\n\nThe closest apple is (5,5). To get there from (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8) then DOWN to (5,7), (5,6), (5,5) would take 3 moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), etc. Either way, similar steps. But moving LEFT first might position me better to avoid the enemy snake at (6,5). The enemy is at (6,5), which is directly below their previous position. They might be heading towards (5,5) as well. If I move LEFT to (5,8), I can start a path that's more direct and possibly avoid collision with the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If they move left to (5,5), they can take that apple. So maybe I need to get there first. But from (6,8), moving LEFT and then down would take 3 moves. The enemy is at (6,5), which is 3 moves away from (5,5) (left once to 5,5). So if I move LEFT now, then next turn I can go down, but the enemy might reach the apple first. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) would take 4 moves. That's longer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,3), (2,4) are clustered on the left. Maybe the enemy is heading there. But their current position is (6,5), so they might go left towards (5,5) or further left. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), then next move DOWN to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. The enemy is at (6,5), so if they move LEFT to (5,5) in one move, they can take the apple. So I need to get there before them. But I can't reach it in one move. So maybe that apple is already going to be taken by the enemy. Maybe I should target another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are in a cluster. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), etc., but that's a long way. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT towards (5,7), but that's still not close. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,3) is on the right. If I move RIGHT to (7,8), then continue right and down towards (9,3). But that's a longer path. Maybe less contested. The enemy is at (6,5), so they might not be heading that way. \n\nBut the enemy's body is empty, so they can move freely. They might be going for the closest apple, which is (5,5). If I can't beat them to it, maybe I should go for another apple. The apples at (2,5) are also possible. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc., but that's a lot of steps. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). If they are at (6,5), they could move UP to (6,6), but that's away from the apple. Or they could move LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. So if I move LEFT now to (5,8), and the enemy moves LEFT to (5,5), they take the apple. But if I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5), but that's three moves. The enemy can take it in one move. So maybe (5,5) is not the best target. \n\nLooking at the other apples: (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc. That's a long way. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), etc. Still a lot. \n\nThe apple at (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. From (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then RIGHT to (9,8), then DOWN to (9,7), etc. That's a long path. \n\nThe apples at (2,3) and (2,4) are also on the left. Maybe the enemy is heading there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should focus on the closest apple that's not contested. The apple at (5,5) is contested. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered. Maybe if I head towards them, but it's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards (5,5), so I should avoid that and go for another apple. Let's see. If I move LEFT to (5,8), then next move LEFT to (4,8), then DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), etc. But that's a lot. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). Maybe they are moving in another direction. Since their body is empty, they can't block themselves. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe the best move is to continue moving DOWN to (6,7) to get closer to the center, then plan the next move. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) to start heading west towards the cluster of apples. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But the enemy might take (5,5) first. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). Let's check their position. They were at (6,5) in the current board. If they move LEFT, they get to (5,5) and eat the apple. So if they do that, then that apple is gone. But if they move in another direction, maybe I can get there. \n\nBut since I can't predict the enemy's move, I have to assume they might take the apple. So maybe it's better to target another apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then DOWN to (2,5). That's 6 moves. That's a lot. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then DOWN to (2,5). Also 6 moves. \n\nThe apple at (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. From (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then RIGHT to (9,8), then DOWN to (9,7), then DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4), then DOWN to (9,3). That's 7 moves. \n\nThe apple at (2,3) is even lower. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best option is to go for the apple at (5,5) even if there's a risk. If the enemy takes it, then I can go for another. But if I don't try, I might miss out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take a different path. Let's see. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. The enemy is at (6,5). If they move LEFT to (5,5) next turn, they take it. So if I move LEFT now, then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then the enemy takes (5,5). Then I can't get that apple. \n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). The enemy could take (5,5) before I get there. \n\nSo maybe (5,5) is too risky. Let's look at other apples. The apple at (2,5) is in the same y=5 row as the enemy's current position. If the enemy is moving left, they might go towards (5,5) or further left. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should head towards the cluster of apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). But that's a long way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards (2,5) as well. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best move is to start moving towards the left side where there are multiple apples, even if it's a longer path. So moving LEFT to (5,8) to start heading west. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7) to get closer to the center. \n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move DOWN to (6,6), then I'm at (6,6), which is one above the enemy's position. If the enemy moves UP to (6,6), that's a collision. But since their body is empty, they can move freely. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) avoids the enemy's path. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving LEFT to (5,8) is safer and starts a path towards the left side apples. \n\nBut I need to make sure I don't get stuck. Since my body is empty, I can turn around if needed. \n\nSo, possible moves:\n\nLEFT to (5,8): safe, starts moving west.\n\nDOWN to (6,7): safe, moves towards center.\n\nUP to (6,9): safe, but not helpful.\n\nRIGHT to (7,8): safe, but moves east.\n\nThe best options are LEFT or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT, I can start heading towards the left apples. If I choose DOWN, I get closer to the center and maybe the (5,5) apple. \n\nBut given the enemy's position, maybe LEFT is better to avoid potential conflict. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7) and then LEFT to (5,7) could be a path. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are moving in another direction. \n\nIn the absence of information about the enemy's next move, I have to assume they might go for the closest apple. \n\nSo, if I move LEFT to (5,8), then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), etc. \n\nI think moving LEFT to (5,8) is a better strategic move to start heading towards the cluster of apples on the left. Even though it's a longer path, it might be safer and less contested. \n\nSo, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,7) now. Wait, no, looking back at the updated board state: the enemy snake #1 is at (6,7) with body at []. So their head is at (6,7).\n\nHmm, the apples are spread out. The closest ones to me are the (5,5) and the cluster on the left (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). From my current position (4,8), possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), that's moving further west. From there, I can start heading down towards the left-side apples. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,7) would take me closer to the center. But the (5,5) apple is south of me. Let's check distances.\n\nFrom (4,8) to (5,5): that's 3 steps down and 1 right. But the enemy is at (6,7). If I go towards (5,5), the enemy might be moving towards it as well. If they go DOWN from (6,7) to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), etc., they could reach (5,5) in a few moves. But maybe they're going for other apples.\n\nAlternatively, the left cluster: from (4,8), moving LEFT to (3,8), then DOWN to (3,7), (3,6), etc., towards (2,5). That's a longer path but maybe safer. Since there are multiple apples there, even if one is taken, others remain.\n\nAnother option: moving DOWN to (4,7) then LEFT to (3,7), etc. That might be a more direct path towards the left apples. But need to check if moving DOWN is safe. The enemy is at (6,7), so they could move in any direction. If they move LEFT to (5,7), that's adjacent to (4,7), which could be a risk if I'm moving there next turn.\n\nWait, the enemy's position is (6,7). Their possible moves are UP to (6,8), DOWN to (6,6), LEFT to (5,7), or RIGHT to (7,7). If they move LEFT to (5,7), that's a position I might approach if I go DOWN to (4,7) and then LEFT. But maybe that's not an immediate threat.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (4,8) to (5,8) would take me back east. But that's where I was before, and there's no apple there. Not helpful.\n\nUP from (4,8) is (4,9), which is the top edge. Safe, but not leading towards any apples. So probably not useful.\n\nSo the best options are LEFT, DOWN, or maybe RIGHT. But RIGHT seems unproductive.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), that's moving towards the left cluster. Then next turn, I can continue down. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,7) gets me closer to the center and the (5,5) apple. But the enemy is at (6,7), so if I go down to (4,7), the enemy could move towards (5,7), which is adjacent. But since their body is empty, they can't block me unless they move into that spot.\n\nBut maybe the (5,5) apple is still reachable. Let's calculate steps. From (4,8) to (5,5): I need to go down 3 and right 1. So path: DOWN to (4,7), then DOWN to (4,6), then RIGHT to (5,6), then DOWN to (5,5). That's four moves. The enemy is at (6,7). If they go DOWN to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then DOWN to (5,5), that's three moves. So they could reach it faster. So maybe competing for (5,5) is risky.\n\nAlternatively, the left cluster: from (4,8), moving LEFT to (3,8), then LEFT to (2,8), then DOWN to (2,7), (2,6), (2,5). That's five moves. But there are three apples there. If the enemy isn't targeting them, I could get multiple apples. But the enemy might also go for them. However, the enemy is at (6,7), which is far from the left cluster. So maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (4,8) to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then LEFT to (2,7), then DOWN to (2,6), etc. That's another way. But which direction is better?\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,3) is far to the east. But that's probably not worth going for right now.\n\nSo, the left cluster seems like a good target. Moving LEFT now starts that path. Let's check if moving LEFT is safe. The next position would be (3,8). There's no snake there, and it's within the board. So yes, safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,7) is also safe. But which direction gets me closer to apples faster?\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), then next move could be LEFT again to (2,8), then DOWN. But that's two moves to get to (2,8), then down. Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then LEFT to (2,7), then down. That's similar steps but maybe a more central path.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now and then down might be more efficient. Let's see:\n\nPath 1: LEFT to (3,8), then LEFT to (2,8), then DOWN to (2,7), (2,6), (2,5). That's 4 moves to reach (2,5).\n\nPath 2: DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), LEFT to (2,7), DOWN to (2,6), then (2,5). Also 4 moves.\n\nSo similar steps. But moving LEFT first keeps me closer to the left edge, which might be safer from the enemy, who is on the right side.\n\nThe enemy is at (6,7). If they start moving towards the left, they might take longer. So maybe the left cluster is safer.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT again to (3,8) continues the westward path towards the apples. It's safe and progresses towards the target.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm snake 2, starting at (7,9). The board is 10x10, with apples at (5,5), (2,5), (9,3), (2,3), (2,4). My body is empty, so I'm just the head. The enemy snake is at (6,3) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move. Since I'm at (7,9), the edges are nearby. Let's check possible moves:\n\nUP: From (7,9), moving up would take me to (7,10), which is outside the board. That's a wall, so that's instant death. So UP is not an option.\n\nDOWN: Moving down to (7,8). That's safe as long as there's no snake there. The board state shows row 9 (y=9) has me at (7,9), and row 8 (y=8) is empty. So moving down to (7,8) is okay. But where's the nearest apple?\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,5), (2,5), etc. But from (7,9), moving down to (7,8) doesn't get me closer to any apple. Maybe I should head towards the apples. Let's see the positions.\n\nThe apple at (9,3) is in the top right corner. But that's far from me. The apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are all in the left side. The apple at (5,5) is in the middle. So maybe I should go left towards the middle or left side.\n\nIf I move LEFT from (7,9), that's (6,9). Then check if that's safe. The board shows row 9 (y=9) has snake 2 at (7,9) and nothing else. So (6,9) is empty. Then moving left again would get me closer to the center. But maybe I can plan a path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is within the board. But there's no apple there. So maybe not the best choice.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I move down to (7,8), then maybe continue down towards (7,7), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving left towards (6,9), then (5,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then continue left towards the apples. The apples at (2,5) are at y=5. So from (7,8), moving down to y=7, 6, 5... but that's a few steps. Alternatively, moving left towards x=6,5,4, etc.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is at x=5, y=5. So from (7,9), moving left and down. Let's calculate the distance. The Manhattan distance from (7,9) to (5,5) is (7-5)+(9-5)=2+4=6. To get there, I need to go left twice and down four times. But that's a long path. Are there any obstacles in the way?\n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake is at (6,3). So in row 3, column 6. So if I go down towards y=5, maybe that's safe. But I need to check if moving left or down first is better.\n\nAlternatively, the apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered on the left side. Maybe those are easier to reach. The distance from (7,9) to (2,5) is (7-2)+(9-5)=5+4=9. That's a longer path, but maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe it's better to go for the closest apple first. Let's see which apple is closest. The apple at (5,5) is 6 steps away. The apple at (2,5) is 9 steps. The apple at (9,3) is (7-9= -2 in x, 9-3=6 in y) so distance 8. The apples at (2,3) and (2,4) are even further. So the closest is (5,5).\n\nSo maybe head towards (5,5). To get there, I need to move left and down. From (7,9), moving left to (6,9) then down to (6,8), etc. But each step needs to avoid walls and other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first. From (7,9), moving down to (7,8). Then left to (6,8), then down to (6,7), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). But need to check if there's any conflict with the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3), which is in the lower part. So as long as I don't go into that area, I should be safe.\n\nAnother consideration: since the enemy snake is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards the apples at (2,3) or (2,4). So if I go towards (5,5), maybe I can avoid conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,3) is in the top right. From (7,9), moving right to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's a longer path. Also, moving right from (7,9) to (8,9) is safe, but then next steps would be down towards (9,3). But that's a long way. Maybe not the best option.\n\nSo the best initial move is probably LEFT or DOWN. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), then down towards (5,8), etc. But that's moving along the top edge. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is safer? Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is far away, maybe both directions are safe. But moving LEFT first might get me closer to the center apples faster.\n\nWait, but moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is safe. Then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe moving LEFT first is better to start heading towards the apples. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) and then LEFT. Let's check if there's any immediate danger.\n\nThe board shows that the enemy snake is at (6,3), which is far from my current position. So moving LEFT or DOWN is safe. The only immediate danger is moving into a wall or another snake. Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is not in my path yet.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT. UP is invalid. So between LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT would take me to (8,9). Then next move could be RIGHT again to (9,9), but that's the edge. Then I can't go further right. So maybe not useful. Unless there's an apple there, but there's none. So RIGHT is not helpful.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better for reaching the closest apple (5,5)?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), etc. That's 4 moves to reach (5,7), then another down to (5,6), then (5,5). So total 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Same number of steps. So either way, same distance.\n\nBut maybe moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples as well. For example, after moving LEFT to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Alternatively, moving DOWN first.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I can reach it before the enemy snake, that's good. But the enemy is at (6,3), which is closer to (5,5) than I am. So maybe they will get there first. Hmm.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,3). The distance from (6,3) to (5,5) is (6-5)+(5-3)=1+2=3. So they can reach it in 3 moves. My distance is 6 moves. So they might get there first. So maybe that apple is not the best target.\n\nIn that case, maybe I should target another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered. The distance from me to (2,5) is 5 in x and 4 in y. So Manhattan distance 9. But maybe the enemy is not going for those. Let's see the enemy's position at (6,3). The distance from them to (2,5) is (6-2)+(5-3)=4+2=6. So they are 6 steps away. I'm 9 steps away. So they might still get there first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,3) is at (9,3). The enemy is at (6,3). So the enemy is 3 steps away (moving right). I'm at (7,9), so distance is (9-7)+(9-3)=2+6=8. So the enemy can reach (9,3) in 3 steps (right, right, right). But the apple is already at (9,3). Wait, the apple is already there. So if the enemy moves right three times, they can get it. But maybe they are heading that way. So perhaps that apple is not a good target for me.\n\nSo maybe the best option is to go for the apple at (5,5) even if the enemy is closer. But since the enemy is at (6,3), they might reach it first. So maybe I should look for another apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a path to collect multiple apples. For example, if I go towards the cluster at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), I can collect them in sequence. But that's a long way. Let's see the path.\n\nFrom (7,9), moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5). Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's recalculate.\n\nFrom (7,9), move left to (6,9) (1), down to (6,8) (2), left to (5,8) (3), down to (5,7) (4), down to (5,6) (5), down to (5,5) (6). So 6 moves to reach (5,5). But the enemy is 3 moves away. So they would get there first. So maybe that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going towards (2,3) or (9,3). But I can't know for sure. So perhaps I should target an apple that's less contested.\n\nLooking at the apples, (9,3) is in the enemy's vicinity, so they might go for that. The apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are in the left. Maybe I can head there. But it's a long path. Alternatively, maybe there's a safer apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is at (2,5). From my position (7,9), moving left and down. Let's see the path. Moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5) which I could collect on the way. Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's see:\n\nFrom (7,9) to (5,5): 6 moves. Then from (5,5) to (2,5): 3 moves left. So total 9 moves. But again, the enemy might get (5,5) first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (2,5) directly. But that's a long way. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to head towards the nearest apple that's not in the enemy's immediate path. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards (9,3) or (2,3). If they go right, they can reach (9,3) in 3 moves. If they go left, they can reach (2,3) in 4 moves. So maybe they are going for (9,3). So perhaps I should avoid that area.\n\nIn that case, maybe the apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are safer. But again, it's a long path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just start moving towards the center to have more options. Let's think about the first move.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next turn I can move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards the center. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is better? Both are safe. Maybe moving LEFT first to start heading towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to get away from the top edge. Since being on the edge can limit movement options. If I move DOWN to (7,8), I'm one step away from the edge. Then I can move LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), that's the same x-coordinate as the enemy, but far away. So no conflict.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) is safe.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best initial move is LEFT to start heading towards the apples on the left. Then next moves can be down and left towards (5,5) or (2,5). But I need to make sure I don't get trapped.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) gives me more space. Let's see the board again.\n\nThe board shows that row 9 (y=9) has me at (7,9). Row 8 is empty. So moving down to (7,8) is safe. Then from there, I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,8), then next move LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards (5,5). But again, the enemy is closer to (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move LEFT first to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are moving towards (5,5). So if I go towards (5,5), I might collide with them. Or maybe not. It's hard to predict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest first move is DOWN to (7,8), then assess next steps. That way, I'm moving away from the edge and into more open space. Then from (7,8), I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut I need to collect apples to grow. So the priority is to reach an apple as soon as possible. The closest apple is (5,5), but the enemy is closer. The next closest is (2,5), but that's far. The apple at (9,3) is also far.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no safe apple to reach before the enemy, so I should just move towards an area with multiple apples, even if it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best first move is LEFT to (6,9), then continue left towards (5,9), (4,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's moving away from the apples.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Since the snake is just starting, maybe the best move is to head towards the nearest apple, even if the enemy is closer. Because if I don't collect apples, I can't grow, and the enemy might get them all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going for (9,3). So if I move towards (5,5), I can get there in 6 moves, and maybe the enemy is not going there.\n\nBut without knowing the enemy's direction, it's hard to say. So perhaps I should take the risk and head towards (5,5).\n\nSo first move: LEFT to (6,9). Then next move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nAlternatively, first move DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich is better? Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT first, I'm at (6,9). Then next move can be DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), DOWN to (5,7), etc.\n\nIf I move DOWN first, I'm at (7,8). Then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nEither way, the path is similar. But moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples earlier.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gives me more space to maneuver.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), then down, I'm on the same x-coordinate as the enemy. But they are far below, so no immediate danger.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) keeps me away from the enemy's x-coordinate.\n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN first is safer to avoid potential paths where the enemy might come up. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), they might move up towards (6,4), etc. So if I'm at (6,9), moving down, there's a lot of space between us.\n\nI think either direction is safe. But since I need to choose between LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (UP is invalid), and RIGHT leads away from apples, the best options are LEFT or DOWN.\n\nSince the apple at (5,5) is in the middle, moving LEFT or DOWN both start the journey towards it. But moving LEFT first might be better to start reducing the x-coordinate towards 5.\n\nSo I'll choose LEFT as the first move. Then next move can be DOWN. That way, I'm heading towards the center and the apple.\n\nBut wait, moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe. Then next move DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a valid path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, but moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left apples.\n\nSo the first move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (5,5) and avoid immediate danger, moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) starts the journey towards the center while staying safe. This direction positions me to continue down and left in subsequent moves, navigating towards the apple cluster. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (6,4) with an empty body. The board hasn't changed much except for my new position.\n\nPossible moves from (6,9):\n- UP: (6,10) which is out of bounds.

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,5) with an empty body. The board shows that row 8 has my snake at (6,8), and the enemy is at (6,5) in row 5.\n\nPossible moves from (6,8):\n- UP: (6,9) which is where I was before. But moving back might not be good since there's no apple there, and it's just empty. But since my body is empty, it's safe. However, that's moving away from the apples.\n- DOWN: (6,7). That's moving towards the center where the apples are. From (6,7), I can continue down towards (6,6), getting closer to (5,5).\n- LEFT: (5,8). Moving left towards the left side of the board. From there, maybe head down towards (5,5) which is an apple. That seems like a possible path.\n- RIGHT: (7,8). Moving right, but that's away from the apples. The rightmost apple is at (9,3), which is far. Not sure if that's the best direction.\n\nThe closest apple is (5,5). To get there from (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8) then DOWN to (5,7), (5,6), (5,5) would take 3 moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), etc. Either way, similar steps. But moving LEFT first might position me better to avoid the enemy snake at (6,5). The enemy is at (6,5), which is directly below their previous position. They might be heading towards (5,5) as well. If I move LEFT to (5,8), I can start a path that's more direct and possibly avoid collision with the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If they move left to (5,5), they can take that apple. So maybe I need to get there first. But from (6,8), moving LEFT and then down would take 3 moves. The enemy is at (6,5), which is 3 moves away from (5,5) (left once to 5,5). So if I move LEFT now, then next turn I can go down, but the enemy might reach the apple first. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) would take 4 moves. That's longer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,3), (2,4) are clustered on the left. Maybe the enemy is heading there. But their current position is (6,5), so they might go left towards (5,5) or further left. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), then next move DOWN to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. The enemy is at (6,5), so if they move LEFT to (5,5) in one move, they can take the apple. So I need to get there before them. But I can't reach it in one move. So maybe that apple is already going to be taken by the enemy. Maybe I should target another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are in a cluster. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), etc., but that's a long way. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT towards (5,7), but that's still not close. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,3) is on the right. If I move RIGHT to (7,8), then continue right and down towards (9,3). But that's a longer path. Maybe less contested. The enemy is at (6,5), so they might not be heading that way. \n\nBut the enemy's body is empty, so they can move freely. They might be going for the closest apple, which is (5,5). If I can't beat them to it, maybe I should go for another apple. The apples at (2,5) are also possible. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc., but that's a lot of steps. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). If they are at (6,5), they could move UP to (6,6), but that's away from the apple. Or they could move LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. So if I move LEFT now to (5,8), and the enemy moves LEFT to (5,5), they take the apple. But if I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5), but that's three moves. The enemy can take it in one move. So maybe (5,5) is not the best target. \n\nLooking at the other apples: (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc. That's a long way. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), etc. Still a lot. \n\nThe apple at (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. From (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then RIGHT to (9,8), then DOWN to (9,7), etc. That's a long path. \n\nThe apples at (2,3) and (2,4) are also on the left. Maybe the enemy is heading there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should focus on the closest apple that's not contested. The apple at (5,5) is contested. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered. Maybe if I head towards them, but it's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards (5,5), so I should avoid that and go for another apple. Let's see. If I move LEFT to (5,8), then next move LEFT to (4,8), then DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), etc. But that's a lot. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). Maybe they are moving in another direction. Since their body is empty, they can't block themselves. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe the best move is to continue moving DOWN to (6,7) to get closer to the center, then plan the next move. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) to start heading west towards the cluster of apples. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But the enemy might take (5,5) first. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). Let's check their position. They were at (6,5) in the current board. If they move LEFT, they get to (5,5) and eat the apple. So if they do that, then that apple is gone. But if they move in another direction, maybe I can get there. \n\nBut since I can't predict the enemy's move, I have to assume they might take the apple. So maybe it's better to target another apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then DOWN to (2,5). That's 6 moves. That's a lot. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then DOWN to (2,5). Also 6 moves. \n\nThe apple at (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. From (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then RIGHT to (9,8), then DOWN to (9,7), then DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4), then DOWN to (9,3). That's 7 moves. \n\nThe apple at (2,3) is even lower. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best option is to go for the apple at (5,5) even if there's a risk. If the enemy takes it, then I can go for another. But if I don't try, I might miss out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take a different path. Let's see. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. The enemy is at (6,5). If they move LEFT to (5,5) next turn, they take it. So if I move LEFT now, then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then the enemy takes (5,5). Then I can't get that apple. \n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). The enemy could take (5,5) before I get there. \n\nSo maybe (5,5) is too risky. Let's look at other apples. The apple at (2,5) is in the same y=5 row as the enemy's current position. If the enemy is moving left, they might go towards (5,5) or further left. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should head towards the cluster of apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). But that's a long way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards (2,5) as well. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best move is to start moving towards the left side where there are multiple apples, even if it's a longer path. So moving LEFT to (5,8) to start heading west. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7) to get closer to the center. \n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move DOWN to (6,6), then I'm at (6,6), which is one above the enemy's position. If the enemy moves UP to (6,6), that's a collision. But since their body is empty, they can move freely. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) avoids the enemy's path. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving LEFT to (5,8) is safer and starts a path towards the left side apples. \n\nBut I need to make sure I don't get stuck. Since my body is empty, I can turn around if needed. \n\nSo, possible moves:\n\nLEFT to (5,8): safe, starts moving west.\n\nDOWN to (6,7): safe, moves towards center.\n\nUP to (6,9): safe, but not helpful.\n\nRIGHT to (7,8): safe, but moves east.\n\nThe best options are LEFT or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT, I can start heading towards the left apples. If I choose DOWN, I get closer to the center and maybe the (5,5) apple. \n\nBut given the enemy's position, maybe LEFT is better to avoid potential conflict. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7) and then LEFT to (5,7) could be a path. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are moving in another direction. \n\nIn the absence of information about the enemy's next move, I have to assume they might go for the closest apple. \n\nSo, if I move LEFT to (5,8), then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), etc. \n\nI think moving LEFT to (5,8) is a better strategic move to start heading towards the cluster of apples on the left. Even though it's a longer path, it might be safer and less contested. \n\nSo, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,7) now. Wait, no, looking back at the updated board state: the enemy snake #1 is at (6,7) with body at []. So their head is at (6,7).\n\nHmm, the apples are spread out. The closest ones to me are the (5,5) and the cluster on the left (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). From my current position (4,8), possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), that's moving further west. From there, I can start heading down towards the left-side apples. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,7) would take me closer to the center. But the (5,5) apple is south of me. Let's check distances.\n\nFrom (4,8) to (5,5): that's 3 steps down and 1 right. But the enemy is at (6,7). If I go towards (5,5), the enemy might be moving towards it as well. If they go DOWN from (6,7) to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), etc., they could reach (5,5) in a few moves. But maybe they're going for other apples.\n\nAlternatively, the left cluster: from (4,8), moving LEFT to (3,8), then DOWN to (3,7), (3,6), etc., towards (2,5). That's a longer path but maybe safer. Since there are multiple apples there, even if one is taken, others remain.\n\nAnother option: moving DOWN to (4,7) then LEFT to (3,7), etc. That might be a more direct path towards the left apples. But need to check if moving DOWN is safe. The enemy is at (6,7), so they could move in any direction. If they move LEFT to (5,7), that's adjacent to (4,7), which could be a risk if I'm moving there next turn.\n\nWait, the enemy's position is (6,7). Their possible moves are UP to (6,8), DOWN to (6,6), LEFT to (5,7), or RIGHT to (7,7). If they move LEFT to (5,7), that's a position I might approach if I go DOWN to (4,7) and then LEFT. But maybe that's not an immediate threat.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (4,8) to (5,8) would take me back east. But that's where I was before, and there's no apple there. Not helpful.\n\nUP from (4,8) is (4,9), which is the top edge. Safe, but not leading towards any apples. So probably not useful.\n\nSo the best options are LEFT, DOWN, or maybe RIGHT. But RIGHT seems unproductive.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), that's moving towards the left cluster. Then next turn, I can continue down. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,7) gets me closer to the center and the (5,5) apple. But the enemy is at (6,7), so if I go down to (4,7), the enemy could move towards (5,7), which is adjacent. But since their body is empty, they can't block me unless they move into that spot.\n\nBut maybe the (5,5) apple is still reachable. Let's calculate steps. From (4,8) to (5,5): I need to go down 3 and right 1. So path: DOWN to (4,7), then DOWN to (4,6), then RIGHT to (5,6), then DOWN to (5,5). That's four moves. The enemy is at (6,7). If they go DOWN to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then DOWN to (5,5), that's three moves. So they could reach it faster. So maybe competing for (5,5) is risky.\n\nAlternatively, the left cluster: from (4,8), moving LEFT to (3,8), then LEFT to (2,8), then DOWN to (2,7), (2,6), (2,5). That's five moves. But there are three apples there. If the enemy isn't targeting them, I could get multiple apples. But the enemy might also go for them. However, the enemy is at (6,7), which is far from the left cluster. So maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (4,8) to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then LEFT to (2,7), then DOWN to (2,6), etc. That's another way. But which direction is better?\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,3) is far to the east. But that's probably not worth going for right now.\n\nSo, the left cluster seems like a good target. Moving LEFT now starts that path. Let's check if moving LEFT is safe. The next position would be (3,8). There's no snake there, and it's within the board. So yes, safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,7) is also safe. But which direction gets me closer to apples faster?\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), then next move could be LEFT again to (2,8), then DOWN. But that's two moves to get to (2,8), then down. Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then LEFT to (2,7), then down. That's similar steps but maybe a more central path.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now and then down might be more efficient. Let's see:\n\nPath 1: LEFT to (3,8), then LEFT to (2,8), then DOWN to (2,7), (2,6), (2,5). That's 4 moves to reach (2,5).\n\nPath 2: DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), LEFT to (2,7), DOWN to (2,6), then (2,5). Also 4 moves.\n\nSo similar steps. But moving LEFT first keeps me closer to the left edge, which might be safer from the enemy, who is on the right side.\n\nThe enemy is at (6,7). If they start moving towards the left, they might take longer. So maybe the left cluster is safer.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT again to (3,8) continues the westward path towards the apples. It's safe and progresses towards the target.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake is at (6,3) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move. Since I'm at (7,9), the edges are nearby. Let's check possible moves:\n\nUP: From (7,9), moving up would take me to (7,10), which is outside the board. That's a wall, so that's instant death. So UP is not an option.\n\nDOWN: Moving down to (7,8). That's safe as long as there's no snake there. The board state shows row 9 (y=9) has me at (7,9), and row 8 (y=8) is empty. So moving down to (7,8) is okay. But where's the nearest apple?\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,5), (2,5), etc. But from (7,9), moving down to (7,8) doesn't get me closer to any apple. Maybe I should head towards the apples. Let's see the positions.\n\nThe apple at (9,3) is in the top right corner. But that's far from me. The apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are all in the left side. The apple at (5,5) is in the middle. So maybe I should go left towards the middle or left side.\n\nIf I move LEFT from (7,9), that's (6,9). Then check if that's safe. The board shows row 9 (y=9) has snake 2 at (7,9) and nothing else. So (6,9) is empty. Then moving left again would get me closer to the center. But maybe I can plan a path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is within the board. But there's no apple there. So maybe not the best choice.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I move down to (7,8), then maybe continue down towards (7,7), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving left towards (6,9), then (5,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then continue left towards the apples. The apples at (2,5) are at y=5. So from (7,8), moving down to y=7, 6, 5... but that's a few steps. Alternatively, moving left towards x=6,5,4, etc.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is at x=5, y=5. So from (7,9), moving left and down. Let's calculate the distance. The Manhattan distance from (7,9) to (5,5) is (7-5)+(9-5)=2+4=6. To get there, I need to go left twice and down four times. But that's a long path. Are there any obstacles in the way?\n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake is at (6,3). So in row 3, column 6. So if I go down towards y=5, maybe that's safe. But I need to check if moving left or down first is better.\n\nAlternatively, the apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered on the left side. Maybe those are easier to reach. The distance from (7,9) to (2,5) is (7-2)+(9-5)=5+4=9. That's a longer path, but maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe it's better to go for the closest apple first. Let's see which apple is closest. The apple at (5,5) is 6 steps away. The apple at (2,5) is 9 steps. The apple at (9,3) is (7-9= -2 in x, 9-3=6 in y) so distance 8. The apples at (2,3) and (2,4) are even further. So the closest is (5,5).\n\nSo maybe head towards (5,5). To get there, I need to move left and down. From (7,9), moving left to (6,9) then down to (6,8), etc. But each step needs to avoid walls and other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first. From (7,9), moving down to (7,8). Then left to (6,8), then down to (6,7), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). But need to check if there's any conflict with the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3), which is in the lower part. So as long as I don't go into that area, I should be safe.\n\nAnother consideration: since the enemy snake is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards the apples at (2,3) or (2,4). So if I go towards (5,5), maybe I can avoid conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,3) is in the top right. From (7,9), moving right to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's a longer path. Also, moving right from (7,9) to (8,9) is safe, but then next steps would be down towards (9,3). But that's a long way. Maybe not the best option.\n\nSo the best initial move is probably LEFT or DOWN. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), then down towards (5,8), etc. But that's moving along the top edge. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is safer? Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is far away, maybe both directions are safe. But moving LEFT first might get me closer to the center apples faster.\n\nWait, but moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is safe. Then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe moving LEFT first is better to start heading towards the apples. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) and then LEFT. Let's check if there's any immediate danger.\n\nThe board shows that the enemy snake is at (6,3), which is far from my current position. So moving LEFT or DOWN is safe. The only immediate danger is moving into a wall or another snake. Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is not in my path yet.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT. UP is invalid. So between LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT would take me to (8,9). Then next move could be RIGHT again to (9,9), but that's the edge. Then I can't go further right. So maybe not useful. Unless there's an apple there, but there's none. So RIGHT is not helpful.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better for reaching the closest apple (5,5)?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), etc. That's 4 moves to reach (5,7), then another down to (5,6), then (5,5). So total 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Same number of steps. So either way, same distance.\n\nBut maybe moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples as well. For example, after moving LEFT to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Alternatively, moving DOWN first.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I can reach it before the enemy snake, that's good. But the enemy is at (6,3), which is closer to (5,5) than I am. So maybe they will get there first. Hmm.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,3). The distance from (6,3) to (5,5) is (6-5)+(5-3)=1+2=3. So they can reach it in 3 moves. My distance is 6 moves. So they might get there first. So maybe that apple is not the best target.\n\nIn that case, maybe I should target another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered. The distance from me to (2,5) is 5 in x and 4 in y. So Manhattan distance 9. But maybe the enemy is not going for those. Let's see the enemy's position at (6,3). The distance from them to (2,5) is (6-2)+(5-3)=4+2=6. So they are 6 steps away. I'm 9 steps away. So they might still get there first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,3) is at (9,3). The enemy is at (6,3). So the enemy is 3 steps away (moving right). I'm at (7,9), so distance is (9-7)+(9-3)=2+6=8. So the enemy can reach (9,3) in 3 steps (right, right, right). But the apple is already at (9,3). Wait, the apple is already there. So if the enemy moves right three times, they can get it. But maybe they are heading that way. So perhaps that apple is not a good target for me.\n\nSo maybe the best option is to go for the apple at (5,5) even if the enemy is closer. But since the enemy is at (6,3), they might reach it first. So maybe I should look for another apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a path to collect multiple apples. For example, if I go towards the cluster at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), I can collect them in sequence. But that's a long way. Let's see the path.\n\nFrom (7,9), moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5). Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's recalculate.\n\nFrom (7,9), move left to (6,9) (1), down to (6,8) (2), left to (5,8) (3), down to (5,7) (4), down to (5,6) (5), down to (5,5) (6). So 6 moves to reach (5,5). But the enemy is 3 moves away. So they would get there first. So maybe that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going towards (2,3) or (9,3). But I can't know for sure. So perhaps I should target an apple that's less contested.\n\nLooking at the apples, (9,3) is in the enemy's vicinity, so they might go for that. The apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are in the left. Maybe I can head there. But it's a long path. Alternatively, maybe there's a safer apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is at (2,5). From my position (7,9), moving left and down. Let's see the path. Moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5) which I could collect on the way. Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's see:\n\nFrom (7,9) to (5,5): 6 moves. Then from (5,5) to (2,5): 3 moves left. So total 9 moves. But again, the enemy might get (5,5) first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (2,5) directly. But that's a long way. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to head towards the nearest apple that's not in the enemy's immediate path. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards (9,3) or (2,3). If they go right, they can reach (9,3) in 3 moves. If they go left, they can reach (2,3) in 4 moves. So maybe they are going for (9,3). So perhaps I should avoid that area.\n\nIn that case, maybe the apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are safer. But again, it's a long path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just start moving towards the center to have more options. Let's think about the first move.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next turn I can move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards the center. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is better? Both are safe. Maybe moving LEFT first to start heading towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to get away from the top edge. Since being on the edge can limit movement options. If I move DOWN to (7,8), I'm one step away from the edge. Then I can move LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), that's the same x-coordinate as the enemy, but far away. So no conflict.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) is safe.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best initial move is LEFT to start heading towards the apples on the left. Then next moves can be down and left towards (5,5) or (2,5). But I need to make sure I don't get trapped.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) gives me more space. Let's see the board again.\n\nThe board shows that row 9 (y=9) has me at (7,9). Row 8 is empty. So moving down to (7,8) is safe. Then from there, I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,8), then next move LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards (5,5). But again, the enemy is closer to (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move LEFT first to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are moving towards (5,5). So if I go towards (5,5), I might collide with them. Or maybe not. It's hard to predict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest first move is DOWN to (7,8), then assess next steps. That way, I'm moving away from the edge and into more open space. Then from (7,8), I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut I need to collect apples to grow. So the priority is to reach an apple as soon as possible. The closest apple is (5,5), but the enemy is closer. The next closest is (2,5), but that's far. The apple at (9,3) is also far.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no safe apple to reach before the enemy, so I should just move towards an area with multiple apples, even if it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best first move is LEFT to (6,9), then continue left towards (5,9), (4,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's moving away from the apples.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Since the snake is just starting, maybe the best move is to head towards the nearest apple, even if the enemy is closer. Because if I don't collect apples, I can't grow, and the enemy might get them all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going for (9,3). So if I move towards (5,5), I can get there in 6 moves, and maybe the enemy is not going there.\n\nBut without knowing the enemy's direction, it's hard to say. So perhaps I should take the risk and head towards (5,5).\n\nSo first move: LEFT to (6,9). Then next move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nAlternatively, first move DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich is better? Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT first, I'm at (6,9). Then next move can be DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), DOWN to (5,7), etc.\n\nIf I move DOWN first, I'm at (7,8). Then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nEither way, the path is similar. But moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples earlier.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gives me more space to maneuver.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), then down, I'm on the same x-coordinate as the enemy. But they are far below, so no immediate danger.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) keeps me away from the enemy's x-coordinate.\n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN first is safer to avoid potential paths where the enemy might come up. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), they might move up towards (6,4), etc. So if I'm at (6,9), moving down, there's a lot of space between us.\n\nI think either direction is safe. But since I need to choose between LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (UP is invalid), and RIGHT leads away from apples, the best options are LEFT or DOWN.\n\nSince the apple at (5,5) is in the middle, moving LEFT or DOWN both start the journey towards it. But moving LEFT first might be better to start reducing the x-coordinate towards 5.\n\nSo I'll choose LEFT as the first move. Then next move can be DOWN. That way, I'm heading towards the center and the apple.\n\nBut wait, moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe. Then next move DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a valid path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, but moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left apples.\n\nSo the first move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (5,5) and avoid immediate danger, moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) starts the journey towards the center while staying safe. This direction positions me to continue down and left in subsequent moves, navigating towards the apple cluster. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (6,4) with an empty body. The board hasn't changed much except for my new position.\n\nPossible moves from (6,9):\n- UP: (6,10) which is out of bounds.

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,5) with an empty body. The board shows that row 8 has my snake at (6,8), and the enemy is at (6,5) in row 5.\n\nPossible moves from (6,8):\n- UP: (6,9) which is where I was before. But moving back might not be good since there's no apple there, and it's just empty. But since my body is empty, it's safe. However, that's moving away from the apples.\n- DOWN: (6,7). That's moving towards the center where the apples are. From (6,7), I can continue down towards (6,6), getting closer to (5,5).\n- LEFT: (5,8). Moving left towards the left side of the board. From there, maybe head down towards (5,5) which is an apple. That seems like a possible path.\n- RIGHT: (7,8). Moving right, but that's away from the apples. The rightmost apple is at (9,3), which is far. Not sure if that's the best direction.\n\nThe closest apple is (5,5). To get there from (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8) then DOWN to (5,7), (5,6), (5,5) would take 3 moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), etc. Either way, similar steps. But moving LEFT first might position me better to avoid the enemy snake at (6,5). The enemy is at (6,5), which is directly below their previous position. They might be heading towards (5,5) as well. If I move LEFT to (5,8), I can start a path that's more direct and possibly avoid collision with the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If they move left to (5,5), they can take that apple. So maybe I need to get there first. But from (6,8), moving LEFT and then down would take 3 moves. The enemy is at (6,5), which is 3 moves away from (5,5) (left once to 5,5). So if I move LEFT now, then next turn I can go down, but the enemy might reach the apple first. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) would take 4 moves. That's longer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,3), (2,4) are clustered on the left. Maybe the enemy is heading there. But their current position is (6,5), so they might go left towards (5,5) or further left. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), then next move DOWN to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. The enemy is at (6,5), so if they move LEFT to (5,5) in one move, they can take the apple. So I need to get there before them. But I can't reach it in one move. So maybe that apple is already going to be taken by the enemy. Maybe I should target another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are in a cluster. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), etc., but that's a long way. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT towards (5,7), but that's still not close. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,3) is on the right. If I move RIGHT to (7,8), then continue right and down towards (9,3). But that's a longer path. Maybe less contested. The enemy is at (6,5), so they might not be heading that way. \n\nBut the enemy's body is empty, so they can move freely. They might be going for the closest apple, which is (5,5). If I can't beat them to it, maybe I should go for another apple. The apples at (2,5) are also possible. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc., but that's a lot of steps. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). If they are at (6,5), they could move UP to (6,6), but that's away from the apple. Or they could move LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. So if I move LEFT now to (5,8), and the enemy moves LEFT to (5,5), they take the apple. But if I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5), but that's three moves. The enemy can take it in one move. So maybe (5,5) is not the best target. \n\nLooking at the other apples: (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc. That's a long way. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), etc. Still a lot. \n\nThe apple at (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. From (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then RIGHT to (9,8), then DOWN to (9,7), etc. That's a long path. \n\nThe apples at (2,3) and (2,4) are also on the left. Maybe the enemy is heading there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should focus on the closest apple that's not contested. The apple at (5,5) is contested. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered. Maybe if I head towards them, but it's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards (5,5), so I should avoid that and go for another apple. Let's see. If I move LEFT to (5,8), then next move LEFT to (4,8), then DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), etc. But that's a lot. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). Maybe they are moving in another direction. Since their body is empty, they can't block themselves. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe the best move is to continue moving DOWN to (6,7) to get closer to the center, then plan the next move. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) to start heading west towards the cluster of apples. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But the enemy might take (5,5) first. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). Let's check their position. They were at (6,5) in the current board. If they move LEFT, they get to (5,5) and eat the apple. So if they do that, then that apple is gone. But if they move in another direction, maybe I can get there. \n\nBut since I can't predict the enemy's move, I have to assume they might take the apple. So maybe it's better to target another apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then DOWN to (2,5). That's 6 moves. That's a lot. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then DOWN to (2,5). Also 6 moves. \n\nThe apple at (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. From (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then RIGHT to (9,8), then DOWN to (9,7), then DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4), then DOWN to (9,3). That's 7 moves. \n\nThe apple at (2,3) is even lower. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best option is to go for the apple at (5,5) even if there's a risk. If the enemy takes it, then I can go for another. But if I don't try, I might miss out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take a different path. Let's see. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. The enemy is at (6,5). If they move LEFT to (5,5) next turn, they take it. So if I move LEFT now, then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then the enemy takes (5,5). Then I can't get that apple. \n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). The enemy could take (5,5) before I get there. \n\nSo maybe (5,5) is too risky. Let's look at other apples. The apple at (2,5) is in the same y=5 row as the enemy's current position. If the enemy is moving left, they might go towards (5,5) or further left. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should head towards the cluster of apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). But that's a long way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards (2,5) as well. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best move is to start moving towards the left side where there are multiple apples, even if it's a longer path. So moving LEFT to (5,8) to start heading west. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7) to get closer to the center. \n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move DOWN to (6,6), then I'm at (6,6), which is one above the enemy's position. If the enemy moves UP to (6,6), that's a collision. But since their body is empty, they can move freely. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) avoids the enemy's path. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving LEFT to (5,8) is safer and starts a path towards the left side apples. \n\nBut I need to make sure I don't get stuck. Since my body is empty, I can turn around if needed. \n\nSo, possible moves:\n\nLEFT to (5,8): safe, starts moving west.\n\nDOWN to (6,7): safe, moves towards center.\n\nUP to (6,9): safe, but not helpful.\n\nRIGHT to (7,8): safe, but moves east.\n\nThe best options are LEFT or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT, I can start heading towards the left apples. If I choose DOWN, I get closer to the center and maybe the (5,5) apple. \n\nBut given the enemy's position, maybe LEFT is better to avoid potential conflict. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7) and then LEFT to (5,7) could be a path. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are moving in another direction. \n\nIn the absence of information about the enemy's next move, I have to assume they might go for the closest apple. \n\nSo, if I move LEFT to (5,8), then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), etc. \n\nI think moving LEFT to (5,8) is a better strategic move to start heading towards the cluster of apples on the left. Even though it's a longer path, it might be safer and less contested. \n\nSo, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Moving here is safe but doesn't help reach apples.\n- DOWN: (5,7) \u2013 moving towards the center and closer to the (5,5) apple.\n- LEFT: (4,8) \u2013 continues west towards the cluster of apples on the left.\n- RIGHT: (6,8) \u2013 back to previous position, which is safe but not productive.\n\nThe closest apple is (5,5). From (5,8), moving DOWN three times would reach it. However, the enemy at (6,5) is one move away from (5,5). If they move LEFT next turn, they'll take the apple.

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,7) now. Wait, no, looking back at the updated board state: the enemy snake #1 is at (6,7) with body at []. So their head is at (6,7).\n\nHmm, the apples are spread out. The closest ones to me are the (5,5) and the cluster on the left (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). From my current position (4,8), possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), that's moving further west. From there, I can start heading down towards the left-side apples. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,7) would take me closer to the center. But the (5,5) apple is south of me. Let's check distances.\n\nFrom (4,8) to (5,5): that's 3 steps down and 1 right. But the enemy is at (6,7). If I go towards (5,5), the enemy might be moving towards it as well. If they go DOWN from (6,7) to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), etc., they could reach (5,5) in a few moves. But maybe they're going for other apples.\n\nAlternatively, the left cluster: from (4,8), moving LEFT to (3,8), then DOWN to (3,7), (3,6), etc., towards (2,5). That's a longer path but maybe safer. Since there are multiple apples there, even if one is taken, others remain.\n\nAnother option: moving DOWN to (4,7) then LEFT to (3,7), etc. That might be a more direct path towards the left apples. But need to check if moving DOWN is safe. The enemy is at (6,7), so they could move in any direction. If they move LEFT to (5,7), that's adjacent to (4,7), which could be a risk if I'm moving there next turn.\n\nWait, the enemy's position is (6,7). Their possible moves are UP to (6,8), DOWN to (6,6), LEFT to (5,7), or RIGHT to (7,7). If they move LEFT to (5,7), that's a position I might approach if I go DOWN to (4,7) and then LEFT. But maybe that's not an immediate threat.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (4,8) to (5,8) would take me back east. But that's where I was before, and there's no apple there. Not helpful.\n\nUP from (4,8) is (4,9), which is the top edge. Safe, but not leading towards any apples. So probably not useful.\n\nSo the best options are LEFT, DOWN, or maybe RIGHT. But RIGHT seems unproductive.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), that's moving towards the left cluster. Then next turn, I can continue down. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,7) gets me closer to the center and the (5,5) apple. But the enemy is at (6,7), so if I go down to (4,7), the enemy could move towards (5,7), which is adjacent. But since their body is empty, they can't block me unless they move into that spot.\n\nBut maybe the (5,5) apple is still reachable. Let's calculate steps. From (4,8) to (5,5): I need to go down 3 and right 1. So path: DOWN to (4,7), then DOWN to (4,6), then RIGHT to (5,6), then DOWN to (5,5). That's four moves. The enemy is at (6,7). If they go DOWN to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then DOWN to (5,5), that's three moves. So they could reach it faster. So maybe competing for (5,5) is risky.\n\nAlternatively, the left cluster: from (4,8), moving LEFT to (3,8), then LEFT to (2,8), then DOWN to (2,7), (2,6), (2,5). That's five moves. But there are three apples there. If the enemy isn't targeting them, I could get multiple apples. But the enemy might also go for them. However, the enemy is at (6,7), which is far from the left cluster. So maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (4,8) to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then LEFT to (2,7), then DOWN to (2,6), etc. That's another way. But which direction is better?\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,3) is far to the east. But that's probably not worth going for right now.\n\nSo, the left cluster seems like a good target. Moving LEFT now starts that path. Let's check if moving LEFT is safe. The next position would be (3,8). There's no snake there, and it's within the board. So yes, safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,7) is also safe. But which direction gets me closer to apples faster?\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), then next move could be LEFT again to (2,8), then DOWN. But that's two moves to get to (2,8), then down. Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then LEFT to (2,7), then down. That's similar steps but maybe a more central path.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now and then down might be more efficient. Let's see:\n\nPath 1: LEFT to (3,8), then LEFT to (2,8), then DOWN to (2,7), (2,6), (2,5). That's 4 moves to reach (2,5).\n\nPath 2: DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), LEFT to (2,7), DOWN to (2,6), then (2,5). Also 4 moves.\n\nSo similar steps. But moving LEFT first keeps me closer to the left edge, which might be safer from the enemy, who is on the right side.\n\nThe enemy is at (6,7). If they start moving towards the left, they might take longer. So maybe the left cluster is safer.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT again to (3,8) continues the westward path towards the apples. It's safe and progresses towards the target.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

Since I'm at (2,8), moving down along y would get me closer to those. So maybe DOWN is a good direction. Let me check if moving DOWN to (2,7) is safe. The board shows row 8 has snake 2 at (2,8) and snake 1 at (5,8). The next rows below (row 7,6, etc.) are empty. So moving DOWN to (2,7) is safe. That would start heading towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT isn't possible because I'm already at x=2, which is the left edge. Wait, the board is 10x10, so x ranges from 0 to 9. So x=2 is not the edge. Wait, no, the coordinates are from (0,0) to (9,9). So moving LEFT from (2,8) would take me to (1,8), which is valid. But there's no apple there. But maybe that's a detour. The apples are down at lower y coordinates. So moving DOWN makes more sense.\n\nWait, but if I go DOWN to (2,7), then next move could be DOWN again to (2,6), then (2,5) which is an apple. That's three moves to reach the apple. Alternatively, if I go LEFT to (1,8), then maybe I can go down from there, but that's a longer path. So the quickest way to the apples is DOWN.\n\nBut I need to check for any immediate dangers. The enemy snake is at (5,8). They might be moving towards the apples too.

The enemy snake is at (6,3) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move. Since I'm at (7,9), the edges are nearby. Let's check possible moves:\n\nUP: From (7,9), moving up would take me to (7,10), which is outside the board. That's a wall, so that's instant death. So UP is not an option.\n\nDOWN: Moving down to (7,8). That's safe as long as there's no snake there. The board state shows row 9 (y=9) has me at (7,9), and row 8 (y=8) is empty. So moving down to (7,8) is okay. But where's the nearest apple?\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,5), (2,5), etc. But from (7,9), moving down to (7,8) doesn't get me closer to any apple. Maybe I should head towards the apples. Let's see the positions.\n\nThe apple at (9,3) is in the top right corner. But that's far from me. The apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are all in the left side. The apple at (5,5) is in the middle. So maybe I should go left towards the middle or left side.\n\nIf I move LEFT from (7,9), that's (6,9). Then check if that's safe. The board shows row 9 (y=9) has snake 2 at (7,9) and nothing else. So (6,9) is empty. Then moving left again would get me closer to the center. But maybe I can plan a path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is within the board. But there's no apple there. So maybe not the best choice.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I move down to (7,8), then maybe continue down towards (7,7), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving left towards (6,9), then (5,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then continue left towards the apples. The apples at (2,5) are at y=5. So from (7,8), moving down to y=7, 6, 5... but that's a few steps. Alternatively, moving left towards x=6,5,4, etc.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is at x=5, y=5. So from (7,9), moving left and down. Let's calculate the distance. The Manhattan distance from (7,9) to (5,5) is (7-5)+(9-5)=2+4=6. To get there, I need to go left twice and down four times. But that's a long path. Are there any obstacles in the way?\n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake is at (6,3). So in row 3, column 6. So if I go down towards y=5, maybe that's safe. But I need to check if moving left or down first is better.\n\nAlternatively, the apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered on the left side. Maybe those are easier to reach. The distance from (7,9) to (2,5) is (7-2)+(9-5)=5+4=9. That's a longer path, but maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe it's better to go for the closest apple first. Let's see which apple is closest. The apple at (5,5) is 6 steps away. The apple at (2,5) is 9 steps. The apple at (9,3) is (7-9= -2 in x, 9-3=6 in y) so distance 8. The apples at (2,3) and (2,4) are even further. So the closest is (5,5).\n\nSo maybe head towards (5,5). To get there, I need to move left and down. From (7,9), moving left to (6,9) then down to (6,8), etc. But each step needs to avoid walls and other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first. From (7,9), moving down to (7,8). Then left to (6,8), then down to (6,7), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). But need to check if there's any conflict with the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3), which is in the lower part. So as long as I don't go into that area, I should be safe.\n\nAnother consideration: since the enemy snake is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards the apples at (2,3) or (2,4). So if I go towards (5,5), maybe I can avoid conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,3) is in the top right. From (7,9), moving right to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's a longer path. Also, moving right from (7,9) to (8,9) is safe, but then next steps would be down towards (9,3). But that's a long way. Maybe not the best option.\n\nSo the best initial move is probably LEFT or DOWN. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), then down towards (5,8), etc. But that's moving along the top edge. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is safer? Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is far away, maybe both directions are safe. But moving LEFT first might get me closer to the center apples faster.\n\nWait, but moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is safe. Then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe moving LEFT first is better to start heading towards the apples. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) and then LEFT. Let's check if there's any immediate danger.\n\nThe board shows that the enemy snake is at (6,3), which is far from my current position. So moving LEFT or DOWN is safe. The only immediate danger is moving into a wall or another snake. Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is not in my path yet.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT. UP is invalid. So between LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT would take me to (8,9). Then next move could be RIGHT again to (9,9), but that's the edge. Then I can't go further right. So maybe not useful. Unless there's an apple there, but there's none. So RIGHT is not helpful.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better for reaching the closest apple (5,5)?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), etc. That's 4 moves to reach (5,7), then another down to (5,6), then (5,5). So total 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Same number of steps. So either way, same distance.\n\nBut maybe moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples as well. For example, after moving LEFT to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Alternatively, moving DOWN first.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I can reach it before the enemy snake, that's good. But the enemy is at (6,3), which is closer to (5,5) than I am. So maybe they will get there first. Hmm.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,3). The distance from (6,3) to (5,5) is (6-5)+(5-3)=1+2=3. So they can reach it in 3 moves. My distance is 6 moves. So they might get there first. So maybe that apple is not the best target.\n\nIn that case, maybe I should target another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered. The distance from me to (2,5) is 5 in x and 4 in y. So Manhattan distance 9. But maybe the enemy is not going for those. Let's see the enemy's position at (6,3). The distance from them to (2,5) is (6-2)+(5-3)=4+2=6. So they are 6 steps away. I'm 9 steps away. So they might still get there first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,3) is at (9,3). The enemy is at (6,3). So the enemy is 3 steps away (moving right). I'm at (7,9), so distance is (9-7)+(9-3)=2+6=8. So the enemy can reach (9,3) in 3 steps (right, right, right). But the apple is already at (9,3). Wait, the apple is already there. So if the enemy moves right three times, they can get it. But maybe they are heading that way. So perhaps that apple is not a good target for me.\n\nSo maybe the best option is to go for the apple at (5,5) even if the enemy is closer. But since the enemy is at (6,3), they might reach it first. So maybe I should look for another apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a path to collect multiple apples. For example, if I go towards the cluster at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), I can collect them in sequence. But that's a long way. Let's see the path.\n\nFrom (7,9), moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5). Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's recalculate.\n\nFrom (7,9), move left to (6,9) (1), down to (6,8) (2), left to (5,8) (3), down to (5,7) (4), down to (5,6) (5), down to (5,5) (6). So 6 moves to reach (5,5). But the enemy is 3 moves away. So they would get there first. So maybe that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going towards (2,3) or (9,3). But I can't know for sure. So perhaps I should target an apple that's less contested.\n\nLooking at the apples, (9,3) is in the enemy's vicinity, so they might go for that. The apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are in the left. Maybe I can head there. But it's a long path. Alternatively, maybe there's a safer apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is at (2,5). From my position (7,9), moving left and down. Let's see the path. Moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5) which I could collect on the way. Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's see:\n\nFrom (7,9) to (5,5): 6 moves. Then from (5,5) to (2,5): 3 moves left. So total 9 moves. But again, the enemy might get (5,5) first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (2,5) directly. But that's a long way. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to head towards the nearest apple that's not in the enemy's immediate path. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards (9,3) or (2,3). If they go right, they can reach (9,3) in 3 moves. If they go left, they can reach (2,3) in 4 moves. So maybe they are going for (9,3). So perhaps I should avoid that area.\n\nIn that case, maybe the apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are safer. But again, it's a long path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just start moving towards the center to have more options. Let's think about the first move.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next turn I can move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards the center. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is better? Both are safe. Maybe moving LEFT first to start heading towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to get away from the top edge. Since being on the edge can limit movement options. If I move DOWN to (7,8), I'm one step away from the edge. Then I can move LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), that's the same x-coordinate as the enemy, but far away. So no conflict.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) is safe.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best initial move is LEFT to start heading towards the apples on the left. Then next moves can be down and left towards (5,5) or (2,5). But I need to make sure I don't get trapped.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) gives me more space. Let's see the board again.\n\nThe board shows that row 9 (y=9) has me at (7,9). Row 8 is empty. So moving down to (7,8) is safe. Then from there, I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,8), then next move LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards (5,5). But again, the enemy is closer to (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move LEFT first to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are moving towards (5,5). So if I go towards (5,5), I might collide with them. Or maybe not. It's hard to predict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest first move is DOWN to (7,8), then assess next steps. That way, I'm moving away from the edge and into more open space. Then from (7,8), I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut I need to collect apples to grow. So the priority is to reach an apple as soon as possible. The closest apple is (5,5), but the enemy is closer. The next closest is (2,5), but that's far. The apple at (9,3) is also far.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no safe apple to reach before the enemy, so I should just move towards an area with multiple apples, even if it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best first move is LEFT to (6,9), then continue left towards (5,9), (4,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's moving away from the apples.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Since the snake is just starting, maybe the best move is to head towards the nearest apple, even if the enemy is closer. Because if I don't collect apples, I can't grow, and the enemy might get them all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going for (9,3). So if I move towards (5,5), I can get there in 6 moves, and maybe the enemy is not going there.\n\nBut without knowing the enemy's direction, it's hard to say. So perhaps I should take the risk and head towards (5,5).\n\nSo first move: LEFT to (6,9). Then next move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nAlternatively, first move DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich is better? Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT first, I'm at (6,9). Then next move can be DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), DOWN to (5,7), etc.\n\nIf I move DOWN first, I'm at (7,8). Then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nEither way, the path is similar. But moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples earlier.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gives me more space to maneuver.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), then down, I'm on the same x-coordinate as the enemy. But they are far below, so no immediate danger.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) keeps me away from the enemy's x-coordinate.\n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN first is safer to avoid potential paths where the enemy might come up. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), they might move up towards (6,4), etc. So if I'm at (6,9), moving down, there's a lot of space between us.\n\nI think either direction is safe. But since I need to choose between LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (UP is invalid), and RIGHT leads away from apples, the best options are LEFT or DOWN.\n\nSince the apple at (5,5) is in the middle, moving LEFT or DOWN both start the journey towards it. But moving LEFT first might be better to start reducing the x-coordinate towards 5.\n\nSo I'll choose LEFT as the first move. Then next move can be DOWN. That way, I'm heading towards the center and the apple.\n\nBut wait, moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe. Then next move DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a valid path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, but moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left apples.\n\nSo the first move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (5,5) and avoid immediate danger, moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) starts the journey towards the center while staying safe. This direction positions me to continue down and left in subsequent moves, navigating towards the apple cluster. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,5) with an empty body. The board shows that row 8 has my snake at (6,8), and the enemy is at (6,5) in row 5.\n\nPossible moves from (6,8):\n- UP: (6,9) which is where I was before. But moving back might not be good since there's no apple there, and it's just empty. But since my body is empty, it's safe. However, that's moving away from the apples.\n- DOWN: (6,7). That's moving towards the center where the apples are. From (6,7), I can continue down towards (6,6), getting closer to (5,5).\n- LEFT: (5,8). Moving left towards the left side of the board. From there, maybe head down towards (5,5) which is an apple. That seems like a possible path.\n- RIGHT: (7,8). Moving right, but that's away from the apples. The rightmost apple is at (9,3), which is far. Not sure if that's the best direction.\n\nThe closest apple is (5,5). To get there from (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8) then DOWN to (5,7), (5,6), (5,5) would take 3 moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), etc. Either way, similar steps. But moving LEFT first might position me better to avoid the enemy snake at (6,5). The enemy is at (6,5), which is directly below their previous position. They might be heading towards (5,5) as well. If I move LEFT to (5,8), I can start a path that's more direct and possibly avoid collision with the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If they move left to (5,5), they can take that apple. So maybe I need to get there first. But from (6,8), moving LEFT and then down would take 3 moves. The enemy is at (6,5), which is 3 moves away from (5,5) (left once to 5,5). So if I move LEFT now, then next turn I can go down, but the enemy might reach the apple first. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) would take 4 moves. That's longer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,3), (2,4) are clustered on the left. Maybe the enemy is heading there. But their current position is (6,5), so they might go left towards (5,5) or further left. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), then next move DOWN to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. The enemy is at (6,5), so if they move LEFT to (5,5) in one move, they can take the apple. So I need to get there before them. But I can't reach it in one move. So maybe that apple is already going to be taken by the enemy. Maybe I should target another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are in a cluster. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), etc., but that's a long way. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT towards (5,7), but that's still not close. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,3) is on the right. If I move RIGHT to (7,8), then continue right and down towards (9,3). But that's a longer path. Maybe less contested. The enemy is at (6,5), so they might not be heading that way. \n\nBut the enemy's body is empty, so they can move freely. They might be going for the closest apple, which is (5,5). If I can't beat them to it, maybe I should go for another apple. The apples at (2,5) are also possible. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc., but that's a lot of steps. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). If they are at (6,5), they could move UP to (6,6), but that's away from the apple. Or they could move LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. So if I move LEFT now to (5,8), and the enemy moves LEFT to (5,5), they take the apple. But if I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5), but that's three moves. The enemy can take it in one move. So maybe (5,5) is not the best target. \n\nLooking at the other apples: (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc. That's a long way. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), etc. Still a lot. \n\nThe apple at (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. From (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then RIGHT to (9,8), then DOWN to (9,7), etc. That's a long path. \n\nThe apples at (2,3) and (2,4) are also on the left. Maybe the enemy is heading there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should focus on the closest apple that's not contested. The apple at (5,5) is contested. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered. Maybe if I head towards them, but it's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards (5,5), so I should avoid that and go for another apple. Let's see. If I move LEFT to (5,8), then next move LEFT to (4,8), then DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), etc. But that's a lot. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). Maybe they are moving in another direction. Since their body is empty, they can't block themselves. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe the best move is to continue moving DOWN to (6,7) to get closer to the center, then plan the next move. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) to start heading west towards the cluster of apples. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But the enemy might take (5,5) first. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). Let's check their position. They were at (6,5) in the current board. If they move LEFT, they get to (5,5) and eat the apple. So if they do that, then that apple is gone. But if they move in another direction, maybe I can get there. \n\nBut since I can't predict the enemy's move, I have to assume they might take the apple. So maybe it's better to target another apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then DOWN to (2,5). That's 6 moves. That's a lot. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then DOWN to (2,5). Also 6 moves. \n\nThe apple at (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. From (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then RIGHT to (9,8), then DOWN to (9,7), then DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4), then DOWN to (9,3). That's 7 moves. \n\nThe apple at (2,3) is even lower. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best option is to go for the apple at (5,5) even if there's a risk. If the enemy takes it, then I can go for another. But if I don't try, I might miss out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take a different path. Let's see. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. The enemy is at (6,5). If they move LEFT to (5,5) next turn, they take it. So if I move LEFT now, then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then the enemy takes (5,5). Then I can't get that apple. \n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). The enemy could take (5,5) before I get there. \n\nSo maybe (5,5) is too risky. Let's look at other apples. The apple at (2,5) is in the same y=5 row as the enemy's current position. If the enemy is moving left, they might go towards (5,5) or further left. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should head towards the cluster of apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). But that's a long way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards (2,5) as well. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best move is to start moving towards the left side where there are multiple apples, even if it's a longer path. So moving LEFT to (5,8) to start heading west. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7) to get closer to the center. \n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move DOWN to (6,6), then I'm at (6,6), which is one above the enemy's position. If the enemy moves UP to (6,6), that's a collision. But since their body is empty, they can move freely. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) avoids the enemy's path. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving LEFT to (5,8) is safer and starts a path towards the left side apples. \n\nBut I need to make sure I don't get stuck. Since my body is empty, I can turn around if needed. \n\nSo, possible moves:\n\nLEFT to (5,8): safe, starts moving west.\n\nDOWN to (6,7): safe, moves towards center.\n\nUP to (6,9): safe, but not helpful.\n\nRIGHT to (7,8): safe, but moves east.\n\nThe best options are LEFT or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT, I can start heading towards the left apples. If I choose DOWN, I get closer to the center and maybe the (5,5) apple. \n\nBut given the enemy's position, maybe LEFT is better to avoid potential conflict. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7) and then LEFT to (5,7) could be a path. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are moving in another direction. \n\nIn the absence of information about the enemy's next move, I have to assume they might go for the closest apple. \n\nSo, if I move LEFT to (5,8), then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), etc. \n\nI think moving LEFT to (5,8) is a better strategic move to start heading towards the cluster of apples on the left. Even though it's a longer path, it might be safer and less contested. \n\nSo, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,7) now. Wait, no, looking back at the updated board state: the enemy snake #1 is at (6,7) with body at []. So their head is at (6,7).\n\nHmm, the apples are spread out. The closest ones to me are the (5,5) and the cluster on the left (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). From my current position (4,8), possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), that's moving further west. From there, I can start heading down towards the left-side apples. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,7) would take me closer to the center. But the (5,5) apple is south of me. Let's check distances.\n\nFrom (4,8) to (5,5): that's 3 steps down and 1 right. But the enemy is at (6,7). If I go towards (5,5), the enemy might be moving towards it as well. If they go DOWN from (6,7) to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), etc., they could reach (5,5) in a few moves. But maybe they're going for other apples.\n\nAlternatively, the left cluster: from (4,8), moving LEFT to (3,8), then DOWN to (3,7), (3,6), etc., towards (2,5). That's a longer path but maybe safer. Since there are multiple apples there, even if one is taken, others remain.\n\nAnother option: moving DOWN to (4,7) then LEFT to (3,7), etc. That might be a more direct path towards the left apples. But need to check if moving DOWN is safe. The enemy is at (6,7), so they could move in any direction. If they move LEFT to (5,7), that's adjacent to (4,7), which could be a risk if I'm moving there next turn.\n\nWait, the enemy's position is (6,7). Their possible moves are UP to (6,8), DOWN to (6,6), LEFT to (5,7), or RIGHT to (7,7). If they move LEFT to (5,7), that's a position I might approach if I go DOWN to (4,7) and then LEFT. But maybe that's not an immediate threat.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (4,8) to (5,8) would take me back east. But that's where I was before, and there's no apple there. Not helpful.\n\nUP from (4,8) is (4,9), which is the top edge. Safe, but not leading towards any apples. So probably not useful.\n\nSo the best options are LEFT, DOWN, or maybe RIGHT. But RIGHT seems unproductive.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), that's moving towards the left cluster. Then next turn, I can continue down. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,7) gets me closer to the center and the (5,5) apple. But the enemy is at (6,7), so if I go down to (4,7), the enemy could move towards (5,7), which is adjacent. But since their body is empty, they can't block me unless they move into that spot.\n\nBut maybe the (5,5) apple is still reachable. Let's calculate steps. From (4,8) to (5,5): I need to go down 3 and right 1. So path: DOWN to (4,7), then DOWN to (4,6), then RIGHT to (5,6), then DOWN to (5,5). That's four moves. The enemy is at (6,7). If they go DOWN to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then DOWN to (5,5), that's three moves. So they could reach it faster. So maybe competing for (5,5) is risky.\n\nAlternatively, the left cluster: from (4,8), moving LEFT to (3,8), then LEFT to (2,8), then DOWN to (2,7), (2,6), (2,5). That's five moves. But there are three apples there. If the enemy isn't targeting them, I could get multiple apples. But the enemy might also go for them. However, the enemy is at (6,7), which is far from the left cluster. So maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (4,8) to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then LEFT to (2,7), then DOWN to (2,6), etc. That's another way. But which direction is better?\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,3) is far to the east. But that's probably not worth going for right now.\n\nSo, the left cluster seems like a good target. Moving LEFT now starts that path. Let's check if moving LEFT is safe. The next position would be (3,8). There's no snake there, and it's within the board. So yes, safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,7) is also safe. But which direction gets me closer to apples faster?\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), then next move could be LEFT again to (2,8), then DOWN. But that's two moves to get to (2,8), then down. Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then LEFT to (2,7), then down. That's similar steps but maybe a more central path.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now and then down might be more efficient. Let's see:\n\nPath 1: LEFT to (3,8), then LEFT to (2,8), then DOWN to (2,7), (2,6), (2,5). That's 4 moves to reach (2,5).\n\nPath 2: DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), LEFT to (2,7), DOWN to (2,6), then (2,5). Also 4 moves.\n\nSo similar steps. But moving LEFT first keeps me closer to the left edge, which might be safer from the enemy, who is on the right side.\n\nThe enemy is at (6,7). If they start moving towards the left, they might take longer. So maybe the left cluster is safer.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT again to (3,8) continues the westward path towards the apples. It's safe and progresses towards the target.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,8) with an empty body. The board shows that I just moved LEFT from (4,8) to (3,8). \n\nFirst, I need to decide the next move to reach an apple while avoiding collisions. Let's check possible directions from (3,8):\n\n- **UP**: (3,9) \u2013 top edge, no apple, safe but not useful.\n- **DOWN**: (3,7) \u2013 empty, leads towards the center.\n- **LEFT**: (2,8) \u2013 empty, moving closer to the left-side apples.\n- **RIGHT**: (4,8) \u2013 where I was before, no apple, but safe.\n\nThe closest apples are the cluster at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). Moving LEFT to (2,8) would position me to go down the left edge towards those apples.

Last move I went LEFT from (3,8) to (2,8). So now I need to decide where to go next.\n\nFirst, I need to find the closest apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), and (2,3) are all along the x=2 column. Since I'm at (2,8), moving down along y would get me closer to those. So maybe DOWN is a good direction. Let me check if moving DOWN to (2,7) is safe. The board shows row 8 has snake 2 at (2,8) and snake 1 at (5,8). The next rows below (row 7,6, etc.) are empty. So moving DOWN to (2,7) is safe. That would start heading towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT isn't possible because I'm already at x=2, which is the left edge. Wait, the board is 10x10, so x ranges from 0 to 9. So x=2 is not the edge. Wait, no, the coordinates are from (0,0) to (9,9). So moving LEFT from (2,8) would take me to (1,8), which is valid. But there's no apple there. But maybe that's a detour. The apples are down at lower y coordinates. So moving DOWN makes more sense.\n\nWait, but if I go DOWN to (2,7), then next move could be DOWN again to (2,6), then (2,5) which is an apple. That's three moves to reach the apple. Alternatively, if I go LEFT to (1,8), then maybe I can go down from there, but that's a longer path. So the quickest way to the apples is DOWN.\n\nBut I need to check for any immediate dangers. The enemy snake is at (5,8). They might be moving towards the apples too. But they're on the right side, so maybe they'll go towards (5,5). So I can focus on the left-side apples.\n\nAnother option: moving RIGHT to (3,8) again. But that's where I was before, and there's no apple there. So that's not helpful.\n\nUP would take me to (2,9), which is the top edge. No apple there, and it's a dead end. Not useful.\n\nSo the best move is DOWN to (2,7), heading towards the cluster of apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3). That path is safe and efficient. No snakes in the way, and it's a straight line down.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, let's see. I'm snake 2, starting at (7,9). The board is 10x10, with apples at (5,5), (2,5), (9,3), (2,3), (2,4). My body is empty, so I'm just the head. The enemy snake is at (6,3) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move. Since I'm at (7,9), the edges are nearby. Let's check possible moves:\n\nUP: From (7,9), moving up would take me to (7,10), which is outside the board. That's a wall, so that's instant death. So UP is not an option.\n\nDOWN: Moving down to (7,8). That's safe as long as there's no snake there. The board state shows row 9 (y=9) has me at (7,9), and row 8 (y=8) is empty. So moving down to (7,8) is okay. But where's the nearest apple?\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,5), (2,5), etc. But from (7,9), moving down to (7,8) doesn't get me closer to any apple. Maybe I should head towards the apples. Let's see the positions.\n\nThe apple at (9,3) is in the top right corner. But that's far from me. The apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are all in the left side. The apple at (5,5) is in the middle. So maybe I should go left towards the middle or left side.\n\nIf I move LEFT from (7,9), that's (6,9). Then check if that's safe. The board shows row 9 (y=9) has snake 2 at (7,9) and nothing else. So (6,9) is empty. Then moving left again would get me closer to the center. But maybe I can plan a path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is within the board. But there's no apple there. So maybe not the best choice.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I move down to (7,8), then maybe continue down towards (7,7), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving left towards (6,9), then (5,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then continue left towards the apples. The apples at (2,5) are at y=5. So from (7,8), moving down to y=7, 6, 5... but that's a few steps. Alternatively, moving left towards x=6,5,4, etc.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is at x=5, y=5. So from (7,9), moving left and down. Let's calculate the distance. The Manhattan distance from (7,9) to (5,5) is (7-5)+(9-5)=2+4=6. To get there, I need to go left twice and down four times. But that's a long path. Are there any obstacles in the way?\n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake is at (6,3). So in row 3, column 6. So if I go down towards y=5, maybe that's safe. But I need to check if moving left or down first is better.\n\nAlternatively, the apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered on the left side. Maybe those are easier to reach. The distance from (7,9) to (2,5) is (7-2)+(9-5)=5+4=9. That's a longer path, but maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe it's better to go for the closest apple first. Let's see which apple is closest. The apple at (5,5) is 6 steps away. The apple at (2,5) is 9 steps. The apple at (9,3) is (7-9= -2 in x, 9-3=6 in y) so distance 8. The apples at (2,3) and (2,4) are even further. So the closest is (5,5).\n\nSo maybe head towards (5,5). To get there, I need to move left and down. From (7,9), moving left to (6,9) then down to (6,8), etc. But each step needs to avoid walls and other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first. From (7,9), moving down to (7,8). Then left to (6,8), then down to (6,7), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). But need to check if there's any conflict with the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3), which is in the lower part. So as long as I don't go into that area, I should be safe.\n\nAnother consideration: since the enemy snake is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards the apples at (2,3) or (2,4). So if I go towards (5,5), maybe I can avoid conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,3) is in the top right. From (7,9), moving right to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's a longer path. Also, moving right from (7,9) to (8,9) is safe, but then next steps would be down towards (9,3). But that's a long way. Maybe not the best option.\n\nSo the best initial move is probably LEFT or DOWN. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), then down towards (5,8), etc. But that's moving along the top edge. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is safer? Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is far away, maybe both directions are safe. But moving LEFT first might get me closer to the center apples faster.\n\nWait, but moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is safe. Then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe moving LEFT first is better to start heading towards the apples. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) and then LEFT. Let's check if there's any immediate danger.\n\nThe board shows that the enemy snake is at (6,3), which is far from my current position. So moving LEFT or DOWN is safe. The only immediate danger is moving into a wall or another snake. Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is not in my path yet.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT. UP is invalid. So between LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT would take me to (8,9). Then next move could be RIGHT again to (9,9), but that's the edge. Then I can't go further right. So maybe not useful. Unless there's an apple there, but there's none. So RIGHT is not helpful.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better for reaching the closest apple (5,5)?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), etc. That's 4 moves to reach (5,7), then another down to (5,6), then (5,5). So total 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Same number of steps. So either way, same distance.\n\nBut maybe moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples as well. For example, after moving LEFT to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Alternatively, moving DOWN first.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I can reach it before the enemy snake, that's good. But the enemy is at (6,3), which is closer to (5,5) than I am. So maybe they will get there first. Hmm.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,3). The distance from (6,3) to (5,5) is (6-5)+(5-3)=1+2=3. So they can reach it in 3 moves. My distance is 6 moves. So they might get there first. So maybe that apple is not the best target.\n\nIn that case, maybe I should target another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered. The distance from me to (2,5) is 5 in x and 4 in y. So Manhattan distance 9. But maybe the enemy is not going for those. Let's see the enemy's position at (6,3). The distance from them to (2,5) is (6-2)+(5-3)=4+2=6. So they are 6 steps away. I'm 9 steps away. So they might still get there first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,3) is at (9,3). The enemy is at (6,3). So the enemy is 3 steps away (moving right). I'm at (7,9), so distance is (9-7)+(9-3)=2+6=8. So the enemy can reach (9,3) in 3 steps (right, right, right). But the apple is already at (9,3). Wait, the apple is already there. So if the enemy moves right three times, they can get it. But maybe they are heading that way. So perhaps that apple is not a good target for me.\n\nSo maybe the best option is to go for the apple at (5,5) even if the enemy is closer. But since the enemy is at (6,3), they might reach it first. So maybe I should look for another apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a path to collect multiple apples. For example, if I go towards the cluster at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), I can collect them in sequence. But that's a long way. Let's see the path.\n\nFrom (7,9), moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5). Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's recalculate.\n\nFrom (7,9), move left to (6,9) (1), down to (6,8) (2), left to (5,8) (3), down to (5,7) (4), down to (5,6) (5), down to (5,5) (6). So 6 moves to reach (5,5). But the enemy is 3 moves away. So they would get there first. So maybe that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going towards (2,3) or (9,3). But I can't know for sure. So perhaps I should target an apple that's less contested.\n\nLooking at the apples, (9,3) is in the enemy's vicinity, so they might go for that. The apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are in the left. Maybe I can head there. But it's a long path. Alternatively, maybe there's a safer apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is at (2,5). From my position (7,9), moving left and down. Let's see the path. Moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5) which I could collect on the way. Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's see:\n\nFrom (7,9) to (5,5): 6 moves. Then from (5,5) to (2,5): 3 moves left. So total 9 moves. But again, the enemy might get (5,5) first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (2,5) directly. But that's a long way. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to head towards the nearest apple that's not in the enemy's immediate path. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards (9,3) or (2,3). If they go right, they can reach (9,3) in 3 moves. If they go left, they can reach (2,3) in 4 moves. So maybe they are going for (9,3). So perhaps I should avoid that area.\n\nIn that case, maybe the apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are safer. But again, it's a long path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just start moving towards the center to have more options. Let's think about the first move.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next turn I can move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards the center. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is better? Both are safe. Maybe moving LEFT first to start heading towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to get away from the top edge. Since being on the edge can limit movement options. If I move DOWN to (7,8), I'm one step away from the edge. Then I can move LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), that's the same x-coordinate as the enemy, but far away. So no conflict.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) is safe.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best initial move is LEFT to start heading towards the apples on the left. Then next moves can be down and left towards (5,5) or (2,5). But I need to make sure I don't get trapped.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) gives me more space. Let's see the board again.\n\nThe board shows that row 9 (y=9) has me at (7,9). Row 8 is empty. So moving down to (7,8) is safe. Then from there, I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,8), then next move LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards (5,5). But again, the enemy is closer to (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move LEFT first to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are moving towards (5,5). So if I go towards (5,5), I might collide with them. Or maybe not. It's hard to predict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest first move is DOWN to (7,8), then assess next steps. That way, I'm moving away from the edge and into more open space. Then from (7,8), I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut I need to collect apples to grow. So the priority is to reach an apple as soon as possible. The closest apple is (5,5), but the enemy is closer. The next closest is (2,5), but that's far. The apple at (9,3) is also far.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no safe apple to reach before the enemy, so I should just move towards an area with multiple apples, even if it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best first move is LEFT to (6,9), then continue left towards (5,9), (4,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's moving away from the apples.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Since the snake is just starting, maybe the best move is to head towards the nearest apple, even if the enemy is closer. Because if I don't collect apples, I can't grow, and the enemy might get them all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going for (9,3). So if I move towards (5,5), I can get there in 6 moves, and maybe the enemy is not going there.\n\nBut without knowing the enemy's direction, it's hard to say. So perhaps I should take the risk and head towards (5,5).\n\nSo first move: LEFT to (6,9). Then next move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nAlternatively, first move DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich is better? Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT first, I'm at (6,9). Then next move can be DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), DOWN to (5,7), etc.\n\nIf I move DOWN first, I'm at (7,8). Then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nEither way, the path is similar. But moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples earlier.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gives me more space to maneuver.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), then down, I'm on the same x-coordinate as the enemy. But they are far below, so no immediate danger.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) keeps me away from the enemy's x-coordinate.\n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN first is safer to avoid potential paths where the enemy might come up. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), they might move up towards (6,4), etc. So if I'm at (6,9), moving down, there's a lot of space between us.\n\nI think either direction is safe. But since I need to choose between LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (UP is invalid), and RIGHT leads away from apples, the best options are LEFT or DOWN.\n\nSince the apple at (5,5) is in the middle, moving LEFT or DOWN both start the journey towards it. But moving LEFT first might be better to start reducing the x-coordinate towards 5.\n\nSo I'll choose LEFT as the first move. Then next move can be DOWN. That way, I'm heading towards the center and the apple.\n\nBut wait, moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe. Then next move DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a valid path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, but moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left apples.\n\nSo the first move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (5,5) and avoid immediate danger, moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) starts the journey towards the center while staying safe. This direction positions me to continue down and left in subsequent moves, navigating towards the apple cluster. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,5) with an empty body. The board shows that row 8 has my snake at (6,8), and the enemy is at (6,5) in row 5.\n\nPossible moves from (6,8):\n- UP: (6,9) which is where I was before. But moving back might not be good since there's no apple there, and it's just empty. But since my body is empty, it's safe. However, that's moving away from the apples.\n- DOWN: (6,7). That's moving towards the center where the apples are. From (6,7), I can continue down towards (6,6), getting closer to (5,5).\n- LEFT: (5,8). Moving left towards the left side of the board. From there, maybe head down towards (5,5) which is an apple. That seems like a possible path.\n- RIGHT: (7,8). Moving right, but that's away from the apples. The rightmost apple is at (9,3), which is far. Not sure if that's the best direction.\n\nThe closest apple is (5,5). To get there from (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8) then DOWN to (5,7), (5,6), (5,5) would take 3 moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), etc. Either way, similar steps. But moving LEFT first might position me better to avoid the enemy snake at (6,5). The enemy is at (6,5), which is directly below their previous position. They might be heading towards (5,5) as well. If I move LEFT to (5,8), I can start a path that's more direct and possibly avoid collision with the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If they move left to (5,5), they can take that apple. So maybe I need to get there first. But from (6,8), moving LEFT and then down would take 3 moves. The enemy is at (6,5), which is 3 moves away from (5,5) (left once to 5,5). So if I move LEFT now, then next turn I can go down, but the enemy might reach the apple first. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) would take 4 moves. That's longer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,3), (2,4) are clustered on the left. Maybe the enemy is heading there. But their current position is (6,5), so they might go left towards (5,5) or further left. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), then next move DOWN to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. The enemy is at (6,5), so if they move LEFT to (5,5) in one move, they can take the apple. So I need to get there before them. But I can't reach it in one move. So maybe that apple is already going to be taken by the enemy. Maybe I should target another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are in a cluster. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), etc., but that's a long way. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT towards (5,7), but that's still not close. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,3) is on the right. If I move RIGHT to (7,8), then continue right and down towards (9,3). But that's a longer path. Maybe less contested. The enemy is at (6,5), so they might not be heading that way. \n\nBut the enemy's body is empty, so they can move freely. They might be going for the closest apple, which is (5,5). If I can't beat them to it, maybe I should go for another apple. The apples at (2,5) are also possible. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc., but that's a lot of steps. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). If they are at (6,5), they could move UP to (6,6), but that's away from the apple. Or they could move LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. So if I move LEFT now to (5,8), and the enemy moves LEFT to (5,5), they take the apple. But if I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5), but that's three moves. The enemy can take it in one move. So maybe (5,5) is not the best target. \n\nLooking at the other apples: (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc. That's a long way. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), etc. Still a lot. \n\nThe apple at (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. From (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then RIGHT to (9,8), then DOWN to (9,7), etc. That's a long path. \n\nThe apples at (2,3) and (2,4) are also on the left. Maybe the enemy is heading there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should focus on the closest apple that's not contested. The apple at (5,5) is contested. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered. Maybe if I head towards them, but it's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards (5,5), so I should avoid that and go for another apple. Let's see. If I move LEFT to (5,8), then next move LEFT to (4,8), then DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), etc. But that's a lot. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). Maybe they are moving in another direction. Since their body is empty, they can't block themselves. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe the best move is to continue moving DOWN to (6,7) to get closer to the center, then plan the next move. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) to start heading west towards the cluster of apples. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But the enemy might take (5,5) first. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). Let's check their position. They were at (6,5) in the current board. If they move LEFT, they get to (5,5) and eat the apple. So if they do that, then that apple is gone. But if they move in another direction, maybe I can get there. \n\nBut since I can't predict the enemy's move, I have to assume they might take the apple. So maybe it's better to target another apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then DOWN to (2,5). That's 6 moves. That's a lot. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then DOWN to (2,5). Also 6 moves. \n\nThe apple at (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. From (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then RIGHT to (9,8), then DOWN to (9,7), then DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4), then DOWN to (9,3). That's 7 moves. \n\nThe apple at (2,3) is even lower. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best option is to go for the apple at (5,5) even if there's a risk. If the enemy takes it, then I can go for another. But if I don't try, I might miss out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take a different path. Let's see. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. The enemy is at (6,5). If they move LEFT to (5,5) next turn, they take it. So if I move LEFT now, then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then the enemy takes (5,5). Then I can't get that apple. \n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). The enemy could take (5,5) before I get there. \n\nSo maybe (5,5) is too risky. Let's look at other apples. The apple at (2,5) is in the same y=5 row as the enemy's current position. If the enemy is moving left, they might go towards (5,5) or further left. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should head towards the cluster of apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). But that's a long way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards (2,5) as well. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best move is to start moving towards the left side where there are multiple apples, even if it's a longer path. So moving LEFT to (5,8) to start heading west. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7) to get closer to the center. \n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move DOWN to (6,6), then I'm at (6,6), which is one above the enemy's position. If the enemy moves UP to (6,6), that's a collision. But since their body is empty, they can move freely. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) avoids the enemy's path. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving LEFT to (5,8) is safer and starts a path towards the left side apples. \n\nBut I need to make sure I don't get stuck. Since my body is empty, I can turn around if needed. \n\nSo, possible moves:\n\nLEFT to (5,8): safe, starts moving west.\n\nDOWN to (6,7): safe, moves towards center.\n\nUP to (6,9): safe, but not helpful.\n\nRIGHT to (7,8): safe, but moves east.\n\nThe best options are LEFT or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT, I can start heading towards the left apples. If I choose DOWN, I get closer to the center and maybe the (5,5) apple. \n\nBut given the enemy's position, maybe LEFT is better to avoid potential conflict. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7) and then LEFT to (5,7) could be a path. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are moving in another direction. \n\nIn the absence of information about the enemy's next move, I have to assume they might go for the closest apple. \n\nSo, if I move LEFT to (5,8), then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), etc. \n\nI think moving LEFT to (5,8) is a better strategic move to start heading towards the cluster of apples on the left. Even though it's a longer path, it might be safer and less contested. \n\nSo, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

But the enemy is at (6,7). If I go towards (5,5), the enemy might be moving towards it as well. If they go DOWN from (6,7) to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), etc., they could reach (5,5) in a few moves. But maybe they're going for other apples.\n\nAlternatively, the left cluster: from (4,8), moving LEFT to (3,8), then DOWN to (3,7), (3,6), etc., towards (2,5). That's a longer path but maybe safer. Since there are multiple apples there, even if one is taken, others remain.\n\nAnother option: moving DOWN to (4,7) then LEFT to (3,7), etc. That might be a more direct path towards the left apples. But need to check if moving DOWN is safe. The enemy is at (6,7), so they could move in any direction. If they move LEFT to (5,7), that's adjacent to (4,7), which could be a risk if I'm moving there next turn.\n\nWait, the enemy's position is (6,7). Their possible moves are UP to (6,8), DOWN to (6,6), LEFT to (5,7), or RIGHT to (7,7). If they move LEFT to (5,7), that's a position I might approach if I go DOWN to (4,7) and then LEFT. But maybe that's not an immediate threat.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (4,8) to (5,8) would take me back east. But that's where I was before, and there's no apple there. Not helpful.\n\nUP from (4,8) is (4,9), which is the top edge. Safe, but not leading towards any apples. So probably not useful.\n\nSo the best options are LEFT, DOWN, or maybe RIGHT. But RIGHT seems unproductive.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), that's moving towards the left cluster. Then next turn, I can continue down. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,7) gets me closer to the center and the (5,5) apple. But the enemy is at (6,7), so if I go down to (4,7), the enemy could move towards (5,7), which is adjacent. But since their body is empty, they can't block me unless they move into that spot.\n\nBut maybe the (5,5) apple is still reachable. Let's calculate steps. From (4,8) to (5,5): I need to go down 3 and right 1. So path: DOWN to (4,7), then DOWN to (4,6), then RIGHT to (5,6), then DOWN to (5,5). That's four moves. The enemy is at (6,7). If they go DOWN to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then DOWN to (5,5), that's three moves. So they could reach it faster. So maybe competing for (5,5) is risky.\n\nAlternatively, the left cluster: from (4,8), moving LEFT to (3,8), then LEFT to (2,8), then DOWN to (2,7), (2,6), (2,5). That's five moves. But there are three apples there. If the enemy isn't targeting them, I could get multiple apples. But the enemy might also go for them. However, the enemy is at (6,7), which is far from the left cluster. So maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (4,8) to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then LEFT to (2,7), then DOWN to (2,6), etc. That's another way. But which direction is better?\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,3) is far to the east. But that's probably not worth going for right now.\n\nSo, the left cluster seems like a good target. Moving LEFT now starts that path. Let's check if moving LEFT is safe. The next position would be (3,8). There's no snake there, and it's within the board. So yes, safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,7) is also safe. But which direction gets me closer to apples faster?\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), then next move could be LEFT again to (2,8), then DOWN. But that's two moves to get to (2,8), then down. Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then LEFT to (2,7), then down. That's similar steps but maybe a more central path.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now and then down might be more efficient. Let's see:\n\nPath 1: LEFT to (3,8), then LEFT to (2,8), then DOWN to (2,7), (2,6), (2,5). That's 4 moves to reach (2,5).\n\nPath 2: DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), LEFT to (2,7), DOWN to (2,6), then (2,5). Also 4 moves.\n\nSo similar steps. But moving LEFT first keeps me closer to the left edge, which might be safer from the enemy, who is on the right side.\n\nThe enemy is at (6,7). If they start moving towards the left, they might take longer. So maybe the left cluster is safer.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT again to (3,8) continues the westward path towards the apples. It's safe and progresses towards the target.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,8) with an empty body. The board shows that I just moved LEFT from (4,8) to (3,8). \n\nFirst, I need to decide the next move to reach an apple while avoiding collisions. Let's check possible directions from (3,8):\n\n- **UP**: (3,9) \u2013 top edge, no apple, safe but not useful.\n- **DOWN**: (3,7) \u2013 empty, leads towards the center.\n- **LEFT**: (2,8) \u2013 empty, moving closer to the left-side apples.\n- **RIGHT**: (4,8) \u2013 where I was before, no apple, but safe.\n\nThe closest apples are the cluster at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).

Last move I went LEFT from (3,8) to (2,8). So now I need to decide where to go next.\n\nFirst, I need to find the closest apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), and (2,3) are all along the x=2 column. Since I'm at (2,8), moving down along y would get me closer to those. So maybe DOWN is a good direction. Let me check if moving DOWN to (2,7) is safe. The board shows row 8 has snake 2 at (2,8) and snake 1 at (5,8). The next rows below (row 7,6, etc.) are empty. So moving DOWN to (2,7) is safe. That would start heading towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT isn't possible because I'm already at x=2, which is the left edge. Wait, the board is 10x10, so x ranges from 0 to 9. So x=2 is not the edge. Wait, no, the coordinates are from (0,0) to (9,9). So moving LEFT from (2,8) would take me to (1,8), which is valid. But there's no apple there. But maybe that's a detour. The apples are down at lower y coordinates. So moving DOWN makes more sense.\n\nWait, but if I go DOWN to (2,7), then next move could be DOWN again to (2,6), then (2,5) which is an apple. That's three moves to reach the apple. Alternatively, if I go LEFT to (1,8), then maybe I can go down from there, but that's a longer path. So the quickest way to the apples is DOWN.\n\nBut I need to check for any immediate dangers. The enemy snake is at (5,8). They might be moving towards the apples too. But they're on the right side, so maybe they'll go towards (5,5). So I can focus on the left-side apples.\n\nAnother option: moving RIGHT to (3,8) again. But that's where I was before, and there's no apple there. So that's not helpful.\n\nUP would take me to (2,9), which is the top edge. No apple there, and it's a dead end. Not useful.\n\nSo the best move is DOWN to (2,7), heading towards the cluster of apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3). That path is safe and efficient. No snakes in the way, and it's a straight line down.

The enemy snake is at (6,3) with no body either.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the safest direction to move. Since I'm at (7,9), the edges are nearby. Let's check possible moves:\n\nUP: From (7,9), moving up would take me to (7,10), which is outside the board. That's a wall, so that's instant death. So UP is not an option.\n\nDOWN: Moving down to (7,8). That's safe as long as there's no snake there. The board state shows row 9 (y=9) has me at (7,9), and row 8 (y=8) is empty. So moving down to (7,8) is okay. But where's the nearest apple?\n\nLooking at the apples, the closest ones are (5,5), (2,5), etc. But from (7,9), moving down to (7,8) doesn't get me closer to any apple. Maybe I should head towards the apples. Let's see the positions.\n\nThe apple at (9,3) is in the top right corner. But that's far from me. The apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are all in the left side. The apple at (5,5) is in the middle. So maybe I should go left towards the middle or left side.\n\nIf I move LEFT from (7,9), that's (6,9). Then check if that's safe. The board shows row 9 (y=9) has snake 2 at (7,9) and nothing else. So (6,9) is empty. Then moving left again would get me closer to the center. But maybe I can plan a path towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (7,9) would take me to (8,9), which is within the board. But there's no apple there. So maybe not the best choice.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I move down to (7,8), then maybe continue down towards (7,7), etc., but that's a longer path. Alternatively, moving left towards (6,9), then (5,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Maybe not the best approach.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then continue left towards the apples. The apples at (2,5) are at y=5. So from (7,8), moving down to y=7, 6, 5... but that's a few steps. Alternatively, moving left towards x=6,5,4, etc.\n\nWait, the apple at (5,5) is at x=5, y=5. So from (7,9), moving left and down. Let's calculate the distance. The Manhattan distance from (7,9) to (5,5) is (7-5)+(9-5)=2+4=6. To get there, I need to go left twice and down four times. But that's a long path. Are there any obstacles in the way?\n\nLooking at the board state, the enemy snake is at (6,3). So in row 3, column 6. So if I go down towards y=5, maybe that's safe. But I need to check if moving left or down first is better.\n\nAlternatively, the apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered on the left side. Maybe those are easier to reach. The distance from (7,9) to (2,5) is (7-2)+(9-5)=5+4=9. That's a longer path, but maybe there's a way to collect multiple apples.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe it's better to go for the closest apple first. Let's see which apple is closest. The apple at (5,5) is 6 steps away. The apple at (2,5) is 9 steps. The apple at (9,3) is (7-9= -2 in x, 9-3=6 in y) so distance 8. The apples at (2,3) and (2,4) are even further. So the closest is (5,5).\n\nSo maybe head towards (5,5). To get there, I need to move left and down. From (7,9), moving left to (6,9) then down to (6,8), etc. But each step needs to avoid walls and other snakes.\n\nAlternatively, moving down first. From (7,9), moving down to (7,8). Then left to (6,8), then down to (6,7), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). But need to check if there's any conflict with the enemy snake. The enemy is at (6,3), which is in the lower part. So as long as I don't go into that area, I should be safe.\n\nAnother consideration: since the enemy snake is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards the apples at (2,3) or (2,4). So if I go towards (5,5), maybe I can avoid conflict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the apple at (9,3) is in the top right. From (7,9), moving right to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's a longer path. Also, moving right from (7,9) to (8,9) is safe, but then next steps would be down towards (9,3). But that's a long way. Maybe not the best option.\n\nSo the best initial move is probably LEFT or DOWN. Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be LEFT again to (5,9), then down towards (5,8), etc. But that's moving along the top edge. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is safer? Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is far away, maybe both directions are safe. But moving LEFT first might get me closer to the center apples faster.\n\nWait, but moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is safe. Then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That path would take me towards (5,5). Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the snake is just starting, maybe moving LEFT first is better to start heading towards the apples. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) and then LEFT. Let's check if there's any immediate danger.\n\nThe board shows that the enemy snake is at (6,3), which is far from my current position. So moving LEFT or DOWN is safe. The only immediate danger is moving into a wall or another snake. Since the enemy is at (6,3), which is not in my path yet.\n\nSo possible directions: LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT. UP is invalid. So between LEFT, DOWN, RIGHT.\n\nRIGHT would take me to (8,9). Then next move could be RIGHT again to (9,9), but that's the edge. Then I can't go further right. So maybe not useful. Unless there's an apple there, but there's none. So RIGHT is not helpful.\n\nSo between LEFT and DOWN. Which is better for reaching the closest apple (5,5)?\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next move could be DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), etc. That's 4 moves to reach (5,7), then another down to (5,6), then (5,5). So total 5 moves.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Same number of steps. So either way, same distance.\n\nBut maybe moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples as well. For example, after moving LEFT to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. Alternatively, moving DOWN first.\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (5,5) is in the middle. If I can reach it before the enemy snake, that's good. But the enemy is at (6,3), which is closer to (5,5) than I am. So maybe they will get there first. Hmm.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,3). The distance from (6,3) to (5,5) is (6-5)+(5-3)=1+2=3. So they can reach it in 3 moves. My distance is 6 moves. So they might get there first. So maybe that apple is not the best target.\n\nIn that case, maybe I should target another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered. The distance from me to (2,5) is 5 in x and 4 in y. So Manhattan distance 9. But maybe the enemy is not going for those. Let's see the enemy's position at (6,3). The distance from them to (2,5) is (6-2)+(5-3)=4+2=6. So they are 6 steps away. I'm 9 steps away. So they might still get there first.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,3) is at (9,3). The enemy is at (6,3). So the enemy is 3 steps away (moving right). I'm at (7,9), so distance is (9-7)+(9-3)=2+6=8. So the enemy can reach (9,3) in 3 steps (right, right, right). But the apple is already at (9,3). Wait, the apple is already there. So if the enemy moves right three times, they can get it. But maybe they are heading that way. So perhaps that apple is not a good target for me.\n\nSo maybe the best option is to go for the apple at (5,5) even if the enemy is closer. But since the enemy is at (6,3), they might reach it first. So maybe I should look for another apple.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a path to collect multiple apples. For example, if I go towards the cluster at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), I can collect them in sequence. But that's a long way. Let's see the path.\n\nFrom (7,9), moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5). Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's recalculate.\n\nFrom (7,9), move left to (6,9) (1), down to (6,8) (2), left to (5,8) (3), down to (5,7) (4), down to (5,6) (5), down to (5,5) (6). So 6 moves to reach (5,5). But the enemy is 3 moves away. So they would get there first. So maybe that's not feasible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going towards (2,3) or (9,3). But I can't know for sure. So perhaps I should target an apple that's less contested.\n\nLooking at the apples, (9,3) is in the enemy's vicinity, so they might go for that. The apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are in the left. Maybe I can head there. But it's a long path. Alternatively, maybe there's a safer apple.\n\nWait, the apple at (2,5) is at (2,5). From my position (7,9), moving left and down. Let's see the path. Moving left to (6,9), then down to (6,8), left to (5,8), down to (5,7), left to (4,7), down to (4,6), left to (3,6), down to (3,5), left to (2,5). That's 9 moves. But along the way, there's the apple at (5,5) which I could collect on the way. Wait, if I go left and down, maybe I can collect (5,5) first. Let's see:\n\nFrom (7,9) to (5,5): 6 moves. Then from (5,5) to (2,5): 3 moves left. So total 9 moves. But again, the enemy might get (5,5) first.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should go for the apple at (2,5) directly. But that's a long way. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest move is to head towards the nearest apple that's not in the enemy's immediate path. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are heading towards (9,3) or (2,3). If they go right, they can reach (9,3) in 3 moves. If they go left, they can reach (2,3) in 4 moves. So maybe they are going for (9,3). So perhaps I should avoid that area.\n\nIn that case, maybe the apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) are safer. But again, it's a long path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should just start moving towards the center to have more options. Let's think about the first move.\n\nIf I move LEFT to (6,9), then next turn I can move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards the center. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich direction is better? Both are safe. Maybe moving LEFT first to start heading towards the apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first to get away from the top edge. Since being on the edge can limit movement options. If I move DOWN to (7,8), I'm one step away from the edge. Then I can move LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) is also safe. So either direction is okay.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy snake is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), that's the same x-coordinate as the enemy, but far away. So no conflict.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) is safe.\n\nHmm. Maybe the best initial move is LEFT to start heading towards the apples on the left. Then next moves can be down and left towards (5,5) or (2,5). But I need to make sure I don't get trapped.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) gives me more space. Let's see the board again.\n\nThe board shows that row 9 (y=9) has me at (7,9). Row 8 is empty. So moving down to (7,8) is safe. Then from there, I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nIf I move DOWN to (7,8), then next move LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a path towards (5,5). But again, the enemy is closer to (5,5).\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should move LEFT first to (6,9), then DOWN to (6,8), etc. Either way, similar steps.\n\nBut since the enemy is at (6,3), maybe they are moving towards (5,5). So if I go towards (5,5), I might collide with them. Or maybe not. It's hard to predict.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the safest first move is DOWN to (7,8), then assess next steps. That way, I'm moving away from the edge and into more open space. Then from (7,8), I can go LEFT, RIGHT, or DOWN again.\n\nBut I need to collect apples to grow. So the priority is to reach an apple as soon as possible. The closest apple is (5,5), but the enemy is closer. The next closest is (2,5), but that's far. The apple at (9,3) is also far.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's no safe apple to reach before the enemy, so I should just move towards an area with multiple apples, even if it's a longer path.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the best first move is LEFT to (6,9), then continue left towards (5,9), (4,9), etc., but that's along the top edge. Not sure.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT to (8,9), then down to (8,8), etc. But that's moving away from the apples.\n\nHmm. This is tricky. Since the snake is just starting, maybe the best move is to head towards the nearest apple, even if the enemy is closer. Because if I don't collect apples, I can't grow, and the enemy might get them all.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are going for (9,3). So if I move towards (5,5), I can get there in 6 moves, and maybe the enemy is not going there.\n\nBut without knowing the enemy's direction, it's hard to say. So perhaps I should take the risk and head towards (5,5).\n\nSo first move: LEFT to (6,9). Then next move DOWN to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nAlternatively, first move DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc.\n\nWhich is better? Let's see:\n\nIf I move LEFT first, I'm at (6,9). Then next move can be DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), DOWN to (5,7), etc.\n\nIf I move DOWN first, I'm at (7,8). Then LEFT to (6,8), then LEFT to (5,8), etc.\n\nEither way, the path is similar. But moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left side apples earlier.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN first gives me more space to maneuver.\n\nAnother consideration: the enemy is at (6,3). If I move LEFT to (6,9), then down, I'm on the same x-coordinate as the enemy. But they are far below, so no immediate danger.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8) keeps me away from the enemy's x-coordinate.\n\nHmm. Maybe moving DOWN first is safer to avoid potential paths where the enemy might come up. But I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, since the enemy is at (6,3), they might move up towards (6,4), etc. So if I'm at (6,9), moving down, there's a lot of space between us.\n\nI think either direction is safe. But since I need to choose between LEFT, DOWN, or RIGHT (UP is invalid), and RIGHT leads away from apples, the best options are LEFT or DOWN.\n\nSince the apple at (5,5) is in the middle, moving LEFT or DOWN both start the journey towards it. But moving LEFT first might be better to start reducing the x-coordinate towards 5.\n\nSo I'll choose LEFT as the first move. Then next move can be DOWN. That way, I'm heading towards the center and the apple.\n\nBut wait, moving LEFT to (6,9) is safe. Then next move DOWN to (6,8). Then LEFT to (5,8), etc. That's a valid path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (7,8), then LEFT to (6,8), etc. Either way, but moving LEFT first gets me closer to the left apples.\n\nSo the first move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nTo reach the nearest apple at (5,5) and avoid immediate danger, moving LEFT from (7,9) to (6,9) starts the journey towards the center while staying safe. This direction positions me to continue down and left in subsequent moves, navigating towards the apple cluster. \n\nNext move: LEFT"

The enemy snake (ID 1) is at (6,4) with an empty body. The board hasn't changed much except for my new position.\n\nPossible moves from (6,9):\n- UP: (6,10) which is out of bounds.

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,5) with an empty body. The board shows that row 8 has my snake at (6,8), and the enemy is at (6,5) in row 5.\n\nPossible moves from (6,8):\n- UP: (6,9) which is where I was before. But moving back might not be good since there's no apple there, and it's just empty. But since my body is empty, it's safe. However, that's moving away from the apples.\n- DOWN: (6,7). That's moving towards the center where the apples are. From (6,7), I can continue down towards (6,6), getting closer to (5,5).\n- LEFT: (5,8). Moving left towards the left side of the board. From there, maybe head down towards (5,5) which is an apple. That seems like a possible path.\n- RIGHT: (7,8). Moving right, but that's away from the apples. The rightmost apple is at (9,3), which is far. Not sure if that's the best direction.\n\nThe closest apple is (5,5). To get there from (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8) then DOWN to (5,7), (5,6), (5,5) would take 3 moves. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), etc. Either way, similar steps. But moving LEFT first might position me better to avoid the enemy snake at (6,5). The enemy is at (6,5), which is directly below their previous position. They might be heading towards (5,5) as well. If I move LEFT to (5,8), I can start a path that's more direct and possibly avoid collision with the enemy.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If they move left to (5,5), they can take that apple. So maybe I need to get there first. But from (6,8), moving LEFT and then down would take 3 moves. The enemy is at (6,5), which is 3 moves away from (5,5) (left once to 5,5). So if I move LEFT now, then next turn I can go down, but the enemy might reach the apple first. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5) would take 4 moves. That's longer. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,3), (2,4) are clustered on the left. Maybe the enemy is heading there. But their current position is (6,5), so they might go left towards (5,5) or further left. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), then next move DOWN to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. The enemy is at (6,5), so if they move LEFT to (5,5) in one move, they can take the apple. So I need to get there before them. But I can't reach it in one move. So maybe that apple is already going to be taken by the enemy. Maybe I should target another apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are in a cluster. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), etc., but that's a long way. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT towards (5,7), but that's still not close. \n\nAlternatively, the apple at (9,3) is on the right. If I move RIGHT to (7,8), then continue right and down towards (9,3). But that's a longer path. Maybe less contested. The enemy is at (6,5), so they might not be heading that way. \n\nBut the enemy's body is empty, so they can move freely. They might be going for the closest apple, which is (5,5). If I can't beat them to it, maybe I should go for another apple. The apples at (2,5) are also possible. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc., but that's a lot of steps. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). If they are at (6,5), they could move UP to (6,6), but that's away from the apple. Or they could move LEFT to (5,5) to get the apple. So if I move LEFT now to (5,8), and the enemy moves LEFT to (5,5), they take the apple. But if I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5), but that's three moves. The enemy can take it in one move. So maybe (5,5) is not the best target. \n\nLooking at the other apples: (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then down to (4,7), etc. That's a long way. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), etc. Still a lot. \n\nThe apple at (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. From (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then RIGHT to (9,8), then DOWN to (9,7), etc. That's a long path. \n\nThe apples at (2,3) and (2,4) are also on the left. Maybe the enemy is heading there. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should focus on the closest apple that's not contested. The apple at (5,5) is contested. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3) are clustered. Maybe if I head towards them, but it's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards (5,5), so I should avoid that and go for another apple. Let's see. If I move LEFT to (5,8), then next move LEFT to (4,8), then DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), etc. But that's a lot. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). Maybe they are moving in another direction. Since their body is empty, they can't block themselves. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. Maybe the best move is to continue moving DOWN to (6,7) to get closer to the center, then plan the next move. Alternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) to start heading west towards the cluster of apples. \n\nIf I move LEFT to (5,8), then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. But that's a longer path. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). But the enemy might take (5,5) first. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not going for (5,5). Let's check their position. They were at (6,5) in the current board. If they move LEFT, they get to (5,5) and eat the apple. So if they do that, then that apple is gone. But if they move in another direction, maybe I can get there. \n\nBut since I can't predict the enemy's move, I have to assume they might take the apple. So maybe it's better to target another apple. \n\nThe apple at (2,5) is at x=2, y=5. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then LEFT to (4,8), then DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then DOWN to (2,5). That's 6 moves. That's a lot. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then DOWN to (3,6), then LEFT to (2,6), then DOWN to (2,5). Also 6 moves. \n\nThe apple at (9,3) is at x=9, y=3. From (6,8), moving RIGHT to (7,8), then RIGHT to (8,8), then RIGHT to (9,8), then DOWN to (9,7), then DOWN to (9,6), then DOWN to (9,5), then DOWN to (9,4), then DOWN to (9,3). That's 7 moves. \n\nThe apple at (2,3) is even lower. \n\nHmm. Maybe the best option is to go for the apple at (5,5) even if there's a risk. If the enemy takes it, then I can go for another. But if I don't try, I might miss out. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I can take a different path. Let's see. From (6,8), moving LEFT to (5,8), then DOWN to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). That's three moves. The enemy is at (6,5). If they move LEFT to (5,5) next turn, they take it. So if I move LEFT now, then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then the enemy takes (5,5). Then I can't get that apple. \n\nAlternatively, if I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move LEFT to (5,7), then DOWN to (5,6), then LEFT to (5,5). The enemy could take (5,5) before I get there. \n\nSo maybe (5,5) is too risky. Let's look at other apples. The apple at (2,5) is in the same y=5 row as the enemy's current position. If the enemy is moving left, they might go towards (5,5) or further left. \n\nAlternatively, maybe I should head towards the cluster of apples at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). But that's a long way. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is moving towards (2,5) as well. \n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe the best move is to start moving towards the left side where there are multiple apples, even if it's a longer path. So moving LEFT to (5,8) to start heading west. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7) to get closer to the center. \n\nWait, the enemy is at (6,5). If I move DOWN to (6,7), then next move DOWN to (6,6), then I'm at (6,6), which is one above the enemy's position. If the enemy moves UP to (6,6), that's a collision. But since their body is empty, they can move freely. \n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT to (5,8) avoids the enemy's path. \n\nHmm. Maybe moving LEFT to (5,8) is safer and starts a path towards the left side apples. \n\nBut I need to make sure I don't get stuck. Since my body is empty, I can turn around if needed. \n\nSo, possible moves:\n\nLEFT to (5,8): safe, starts moving west.\n\nDOWN to (6,7): safe, moves towards center.\n\nUP to (6,9): safe, but not helpful.\n\nRIGHT to (7,8): safe, but moves east.\n\nThe best options are LEFT or DOWN. \n\nIf I choose LEFT, I can start heading towards the left apples. If I choose DOWN, I get closer to the center and maybe the (5,5) apple. \n\nBut given the enemy's position, maybe LEFT is better to avoid potential conflict. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7) and then LEFT to (5,7) could be a path. \n\nBut I'm not sure. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the enemy is not moving towards (5,5). Maybe they are moving in another direction. \n\nIn the absence of information about the enemy's next move, I have to assume they might go for the closest apple. \n\nSo, if I move LEFT to (5,8), then next turn I can go DOWN to (5,7), then LEFT to (4,7), etc. \n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (6,7), then LEFT to (5,7), etc. \n\nI think moving LEFT to (5,8) is a better strategic move to start heading towards the cluster of apples on the left. Even though it's a longer path, it might be safer and less contested. \n\nSo, the next move should be LEFT.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,7) now. Wait, no, looking back at the updated board state: the enemy snake #1 is at (6,7) with body at []. So their head is at (6,7).\n\nHmm, the apples are spread out. The closest ones to me are the (5,5) and the cluster on the left (2,3), (2,4), (2,5). From my current position (4,8), possible moves are UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), that's moving further west. From there, I can start heading down towards the left-side apples. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,7) would take me closer to the center. But the (5,5) apple is south of me. Let's check distances.\n\nFrom (4,8) to (5,5): that's 3 steps down and 1 right. But the enemy is at (6,7). If I go towards (5,5), the enemy might be moving towards it as well. If they go DOWN from (6,7) to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), etc., they could reach (5,5) in a few moves. But maybe they're going for other apples.\n\nAlternatively, the left cluster: from (4,8), moving LEFT to (3,8), then DOWN to (3,7), (3,6), etc., towards (2,5). That's a longer path but maybe safer. Since there are multiple apples there, even if one is taken, others remain.\n\nAnother option: moving DOWN to (4,7) then LEFT to (3,7), etc. That might be a more direct path towards the left apples. But need to check if moving DOWN is safe. The enemy is at (6,7), so they could move in any direction. If they move LEFT to (5,7), that's adjacent to (4,7), which could be a risk if I'm moving there next turn.\n\nWait, the enemy's position is (6,7). Their possible moves are UP to (6,8), DOWN to (6,6), LEFT to (5,7), or RIGHT to (7,7). If they move LEFT to (5,7), that's a position I might approach if I go DOWN to (4,7) and then LEFT. But maybe that's not an immediate threat.\n\nAlternatively, moving RIGHT from (4,8) to (5,8) would take me back east. But that's where I was before, and there's no apple there. Not helpful.\n\nUP from (4,8) is (4,9), which is the top edge. Safe, but not leading towards any apples. So probably not useful.\n\nSo the best options are LEFT, DOWN, or maybe RIGHT. But RIGHT seems unproductive.\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), that's moving towards the left cluster. Then next turn, I can continue down. Alternatively, moving DOWN to (4,7) gets me closer to the center and the (5,5) apple. But the enemy is at (6,7), so if I go down to (4,7), the enemy could move towards (5,7), which is adjacent. But since their body is empty, they can't block me unless they move into that spot.\n\nBut maybe the (5,5) apple is still reachable. Let's calculate steps. From (4,8) to (5,5): I need to go down 3 and right 1. So path: DOWN to (4,7), then DOWN to (4,6), then RIGHT to (5,6), then DOWN to (5,5). That's four moves. The enemy is at (6,7). If they go DOWN to (6,6), then LEFT to (5,6), then DOWN to (5,5), that's three moves. So they could reach it faster. So maybe competing for (5,5) is risky.\n\nAlternatively, the left cluster: from (4,8), moving LEFT to (3,8), then LEFT to (2,8), then DOWN to (2,7), (2,6), (2,5). That's five moves. But there are three apples there. If the enemy isn't targeting them, I could get multiple apples. But the enemy might also go for them. However, the enemy is at (6,7), which is far from the left cluster. So maybe that's a safer path.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN from (4,8) to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then LEFT to (2,7), then DOWN to (2,6), etc. That's another way. But which direction is better?\n\nAnother consideration: the apple at (9,3) is far to the east. But that's probably not worth going for right now.\n\nSo, the left cluster seems like a good target. Moving LEFT now starts that path. Let's check if moving LEFT is safe. The next position would be (3,8). There's no snake there, and it's within the board. So yes, safe.\n\nAlternatively, moving DOWN to (4,7) is also safe. But which direction gets me closer to apples faster?\n\nIf I go LEFT to (3,8), then next move could be LEFT again to (2,8), then DOWN. But that's two moves to get to (2,8), then down. Alternatively, moving DOWN first to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), then LEFT to (2,7), then down. That's similar steps but maybe a more central path.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT now and then down might be more efficient. Let's see:\n\nPath 1: LEFT to (3,8), then LEFT to (2,8), then DOWN to (2,7), (2,6), (2,5). That's 4 moves to reach (2,5).\n\nPath 2: DOWN to (4,7), then LEFT to (3,7), LEFT to (2,7), DOWN to (2,6), then (2,5). Also 4 moves.\n\nSo similar steps. But moving LEFT first keeps me closer to the left edge, which might be safer from the enemy, who is on the right side.\n\nThe enemy is at (6,7). If they start moving towards the left, they might take longer. So maybe the left cluster is safer.\n\nTherefore, moving LEFT again to (3,8) continues the westward path towards the apples. It's safe and progresses towards the target.\n</think>\n\nLEFT"

The enemy snake #1 is at (6,8) with an empty body. The board shows that I just moved LEFT from (4,8) to (3,8). \n\nFirst, I need to decide the next move to reach an apple while avoiding collisions. Let's check possible directions from (3,8):\n\n- **UP**: (3,9) \u2013 top edge, no apple, safe but not useful.\n- **DOWN**: (3,7) \u2013 empty, leads towards the center.\n- **LEFT**: (2,8) \u2013 empty, moving closer to the left-side apples.\n- **RIGHT**: (4,8) \u2013 where I was before, no apple, but safe.\n\nThe closest apples are the cluster at (2,3), (2,4), (2,5).

Last move I went LEFT from (3,8) to (2,8). So now I need to decide where to go next.\n\nFirst, I need to find the closest apple. The apples at (2,5), (2,4), and (2,3) are all along the x=2 column. Since I'm at (2,8), moving down along y would get me closer to those. So maybe DOWN is a good direction. Let me check if moving DOWN to (2,7) is safe. The board shows row 8 has snake 2 at (2,8) and snake 1 at (5,8). The next rows below (row 7,6, etc.) are empty. So moving DOWN to (2,7) is safe. That would start heading towards those apples.\n\nAlternatively, moving LEFT isn't possible because I'm already at x=2, which is the left edge. Wait, the board is 10x10, so x ranges from 0 to 9. So x=2 is not the edge. Wait, no, the coordinates are from (0,0) to (9,9). So moving LEFT from (2,8) would take me to (1,8), which is valid. But there's no apple there. But maybe that's a detour. The apples are down at lower y coordinates. So moving DOWN makes more sense.\n\nWait, but if I go DOWN to (2,7), then next move could be DOWN again to (2,6), then (2,5) which is an apple. That's three moves to reach the apple. Alternatively, if I go LEFT to (1,8), then maybe I can go down from there, but that's a longer path. So the quickest way to the apples is DOWN.\n\nBut I need to check for any immediate dangers. The enemy snake is at (5,8). They might be moving towards the apples too. But they're on the right side, so maybe they'll go towards (5,5). So I can focus on the left-side apples.\n\nAnother option: moving RIGHT to (3,8) again.

Not useful.\n\nSo the best move is DOWN to (2,7), heading towards the cluster of apples at (2,5), (2,4), (2,3). That path is safe and efficient. No snakes in the way, and it's a straight line down.
