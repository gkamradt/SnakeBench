This move prevents any interaction with walls or enemy snake territories and keeps open multiple future path choices.\n\n**Post-Apple Collection Strategy:**\nIf successful in eating the apple at (2, 5), the best subsequent strategy would be reassessing the most accessible apples while avoiding walls and maintaining distance from the enemy snake. Options could include heading DOWN and then RIGHT for the apples on the lower right or navigating UP and RIGHT for the top-side apples if the path remains favorable.\n\n**Final Decision:** LEFT.\n\nThis move aims to safely collect the nearest apple and avoid immediate threats, allowing further expansion and scoring in the following turns."

Depending on the enemy's position, either pursue the next closest apple at (2, 5) by continuing left (if safe) or adjust the strategy to head toward other safely reachable apples. \n- Continue monitoring the position of the enemy snake closely to avoid any direct collision or being blocked off to access crucial points.\n\n**Next Move Decision:**\n- The strategic option indicating the highest immediate reward with minimal risk is to move left towards the apple at (4, 5).\n\n**Final decision:** LEFT."

Additionally, after securing the apple at (2, 5), I can then decide on the next move based on the updated positions of the enemy snake and remaining apples. This move prevents any interaction with walls or enemy snake territories and keeps open multiple future path choices.\n\n**Post-Apple Collection Strategy:**\nIf successful in eating the apple at (2, 5), the best subsequent strategy would be reassessing the most accessible apples while avoiding walls and maintaining distance from the enemy snake. Options could include heading DOWN and then RIGHT for the apples on the lower right or navigating UP and RIGHT for the top-side apples if the path remains favorable.\n\n**Final Decision:** LEFT.\n\nThis move aims to safely collect the nearest apple and avoid immediate threats, allowing further expansion and scoring in the following turns."
