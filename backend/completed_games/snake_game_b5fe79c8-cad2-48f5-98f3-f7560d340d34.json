The last consumed segment means the board state needs review to strategize the next optimal move.\n\nI now face the need to determine the next best course of action:\n\n1. Avoid collision: I must prevent movements that would result in hitting a wall or my own body.\n\n2. Acquisition of next closest apple:\n   - Apples at: (4, 1), (8, 8), (9, 8), (7, 3), (2, 4)\n   - The apple at (2, 4) seems to be the closest viable option, considering my snake's positioning and the absence of immediate obstacles in that trajectory.\n\n3. Path Consideration:\n   - Moving UP will position me closer to the center of the board and away from boundaries. However, the journey to the nearest apple at (2, 4) through this route would require multiple moves, veering initially RIGHT or UP to navigate towards it effectively.\n   - Moving RIGHT twice or more followed by subsequent UP moves will align me towards the apple at (2, 4).\n\nImmediate Decision:\n- An immediate RIGHT move would increment x-coordinate from 1 to 2, positioning myself at (2, 2), which is a safe and strategic step towards reaching the apple at (2, 4).\n\nNext Turn Strategy:\n- I will reassess the position after moving RIGHT, with the potential continuation to move either further RIGHT or UP based on proximity to the apple at (2, 4) and positions of any perceived threats.\n\nDecided next move: RIGHT."

Moving towards (2, 4) would bring me closer to that apple, but it would also put me on a potential collision course with snake #1 at (1, 2).\n4. The next closest apple is at (7, 3), which is just 1 move DOWN from my current position.\n5. Moving DOWN towards (7, 3) would get me an apple and also keep me a safe distance from snake #1 for now.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving DOWN and eating the apple at (7, 3), I should re-evaluate the board state and try to move towards the remaining apples while avoiding snake #1 and any potential collisions.\n\nNext move: DOWN"
