            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this 10x10 apple snake game. Let me start by understanding the problem and the rules.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. The snake is at position (2,5), and there are apples at (3,4), (6,9), (6,7), (4,8), and (3,9). My goal is to collect as many apples as possible to maximize points.\n\nThe rules are:\n1. If I move onto an apple, I grow and gain 1 point.\n2. If I hit a wall, another snake, or myself, I die.\n3. I need to maximize points by the end.\n\nLooking at the board state, I see that the snake is at (2,5). The board is represented with numbers showing the snake's body segments. The snake's body is made up of consecutive segments, so I need to check if moving in a direction would take me into an apple or into a wall or another snake.\n\nLet me visualize the board. The board is given as a series of rows, each with numbers and 'A's for apples. The snake's body is represented by consecutive '2's, '1's, etc., but in the end, the snake's body is just the snake's head and body segments. Wait, no, the snake's body is represented by the snake's body segments, which are the numbers in the snake's body. So, for example, if the snake is at (2,5), and it's moving right, it would go to (2,6), then (2,7), etc. But in the given board, the snake's body is represented by the numbers, so I need to see where the snake's body is.\n\nWait, the board state is given as a grid where each cell is either a number (snake's body), 'A' for apples, or a wall. So, the snake's body is the consecutive numbers in the snake's path. So, for example, if the snake is at (2,5), and it's moving right, it would go to (2,6), which is a '2', then (2,7) which is '1', and so on. But in the given board, the snake's body is represented by the numbers, so I need to see where the snake's body is.\n\nWait, the snake's body is represented by the snake's body segments, which are the numbers in the snake's body.

But in the given board, the snake's body is represented by the snake's body segments, which are the numbers in the snake's body. So, the snake's body is the consecutive numbers in the snake's path.\n\nWait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Let me think differently. The snake's body is represented by the numbers in the snake's body segments. So, for example, if the snake is at (2,5), and it's moving right, it would go to (2,6), which is a '2', then (2,7) which is '1', and so on.
