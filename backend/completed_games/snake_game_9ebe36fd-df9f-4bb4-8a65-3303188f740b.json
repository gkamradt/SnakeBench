This could be a good target to move towards, as it will allow me to gain a point while also keeping a safe distance from the enemy snake.\n\nThe next closest apple is at (0, 2), which is left from my current position. Moving in that direction would bring me closer to the enemy snake, which could be risky.\n\nConsidering the overall strategy, I think the best move would be to go DOWN. This will move me closer to the apple at (9, 1) while keeping me at a safe distance from the enemy snake. Going down also keeps me closer to the center of the board, which could be advantageous in the long run.\n\nNext turn, I will focus on moving towards the apple at (9, 1) while continuing to monitor the enemy snake's position. I may also consider moving right towards the apple at (0, 2) if the situation becomes more favorable.\n\nMy next move: DOWN."

Collecting the apple at (0, 2) will not only increase my score but also provide me with a safe and strategic starting point for potential movement in the next turn.\n\n**Next move: LEFT**\n\nRemember to reassess the playing field for new apple positions and threats from enemy snakes or board edges after collecting the apple at (0, 2). Keep an eye on the direction of other snakes and the potential future positions of apples to maintain a survivable and efficient path."
