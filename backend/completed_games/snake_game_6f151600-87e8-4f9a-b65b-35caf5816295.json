Therefore, we can safely move left and then up to collect the apple. The goal is to collect the apples in the most efficient way while avoiding danger.\n\nHere's the strategy:\n1. Move left to (4, 3).\n2. Move left again to (3, 3).\n3. Move up to (3, 8) to collect the apple.\n\nAfter collecting the apple at (3, 8), the snake will be at (3, 7) facing upwards. The next closest apple is at (9, 7). To get there:\n1. Move right to (9, 7).\n2. Move down to (9, 0) to collect the next apple.\n3. After collecting the apple at (9, 0), the snake will be at (9, 9), which is a safe position to reassess the board.\n\nFollowing this strategy, the next move should be to continue moving left to align with the apple at (3, 8).\n\nNext move: LEFT.\n\nFor the next turn, I should remind myself to move UP to collect the apple at (3, 8)."

However, we should also be cautious of Snake #1's position at (3, 3) which is now at (3, 4) after its potential movement. Our strategy for now is to move downward to collect the nearby apple while monitoring Snake #1's movements. Next move: DOWN"
