Checking for collisions: Moving UP will put me at (9, 10), which is outside the board.\n\nStrategy for next turn:  Prioritize moving to the closest apple if no collision risk. Continue to avoid collisions with my body and the enemy snake's body.  Recalculate distances after each move.  If no apples are in immediate range, move to the closest available one.\n\n\nNext move: UP"

Its body is at (8, 9), (8, 8) and (7, 8).\n\nMoving UP to (8, 7) seems like a reasonable move.\nMoving DOWN to (8, 5) might be too far away from the apples I want to get.\nMoving RIGHT to (9, 6) is safe and gets me closer to the apple at (9, 5).\n\nRight seems good, but up is also appealing.\n\nNext turn strategy: Check for enemy snake positions, and continue moving towards right/up diagonal depending on enemy snake's movement. Prioritize getting apples and safety. Avoid snake 2 and the wall.\n\nRIGHT"
