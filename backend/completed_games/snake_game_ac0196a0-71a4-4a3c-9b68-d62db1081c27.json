Next turn I can simply go DOWN to collect the apple, so my Manhattan distance from the target becomes 1.\n\u2022 Moving DOWN would take me to (6,4), which is also safe and is 1 step horizontally away from (5,4), but then I\u2019d need to move LEFT next. Both options make progress.\n\u2022 Moving UP (to (6,6)) would increase my vertical distance from (5,4) and is less direct.\n\u2022 Moving RIGHT would put me back onto my tail (or reversed body) since my previous head (now tail) is at (7,5), which is forbidden.\n\nThere\u2019s no immediate threat from enemy Snake #2 at (4,5) along these chosen preliminary paths.\n\nBetween LEFT and DOWN the reasoning is similar, but as per my previous plan and the fact that moving LEFT puts me directly above the apple, I decide to continue the same strategy.\n\nDecided next move: LEFT."
