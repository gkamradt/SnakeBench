The enemy snake remains at (8, 7) with its body at (7, 7), posing no immediate threat.\n\nMy strategy from the previous turn is still valid:\n\n1. Continue moving up to collect the apple at (0, 4). This is the most efficient path to scoring a point and growing longer. It will take me 4 more moves to reach it.\n\n2. After reaching the apple at (0, 4), I should consider moving towards the cluster of apples in the top right corner, especially the one at (5, 9). This could allow me to collect multiple apples in quick succession.\n\nThe enemy snake's position is unchanged, so I don't need to worry about it blocking me in the short term. However, I should keep tracking its movements in case it starts to move towards the apples I'm targeting.\n\nStrategy for next turn: Stay focused on collecting the apple at (0, 4) by continuing to move up. Once I reach that apple, reevaluate the board state and consider heading towards the apple at (5, 9), particularly if the enemy snake stays put or moves away from that region.\n\nUP"
