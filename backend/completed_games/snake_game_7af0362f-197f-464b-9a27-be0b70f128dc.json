The apple at (9, 8) is directly above me; however, I cannot move onto it since my current position is already at (5, 8) and it does not contain an apple. \n\nThe nearest apple from my current position is still (8, 6), which is a few moves away. I note the position of the enemy snake at (0, 0) with its body extending downwards; it doesn't affect my immediate movement.\n\n### Possible Moves from (5, 8)\n1. **UP (5, 9)**: This move is invalid as it goes outside the board (the maximum y coordinate is 9).\n2. **DOWN (5, 7)**: This move takes me back to the previous position, which isn't beneficial.\n3. **LEFT (4, 8)**: A valid move, providing an open area without immediate threats, and keeping me flexible.\n4. **RIGHT (6, 8)**: Also valid, keeping the open area option intact.\n\n### Move Evaluation\n- **UP**: Invalid move.\n- **DOWN**: Backtracking to (5, 7), not advantageous.\n- **LEFT (4, 8)**: An available option and keeps options open in multiple directions.\n- **RIGHT (6, 8)**: This also keeps me in a valid position and opens pathways toward (8, 6).\n\n### Strategic Consideration\nI'm deciding between moving LEFT or RIGHT. If I move LEFT to (4, 8), I am still not getting closer to any apples, but I will open up my options for the next round. If I move RIGHT to (6, 8), it will keep me closer to the direction of the apple at (8, 6) and potentially allow smoother access towards the top row soon.\n\n### Conclusion\nI have two equally valid paths before me; however, moving RIGHT (6, 8) is a more engaging choice, keeping me aligned with future apple chasing.\n\nDecided next move: **RIGHT**"

Examining the board again, I see that there are apples at (0, 4), (8, 6), (9, 8), (0, 3), and (8, 0). The apple at (9, 8) is directly above me; however, I cannot move onto it since my current position is already at (5, 8) and it does not contain an apple. \n\nThe nearest apple from my current position is still (8, 6), which is a few moves away. I note the position of the enemy snake at (0, 0) with its body extending downwards; it doesn't affect my immediate movement.\n\n### Possible Moves from (5, 8)\n1. **UP (5, 9)**: This move is invalid as it goes outside the board (the maximum y coordinate is 9).\n2. **DOWN (5, 7)**: This move takes me back to the previous position, which isn't beneficial.\n3. **LEFT (4, 8)**: A valid move, providing an open area without immediate threats, and keeping me flexible.\n4. **RIGHT (6, 8)**: Also valid, keeping the open area option intact.\n\n### Move Evaluation\n- **UP**: Invalid move.\n- **DOWN**: Backtracking to (5, 7), not advantageous.\n- **LEFT (4, 8)**: An available option and keeps options open in multiple directions.\n- **RIGHT (6, 8)**: This also keeps me in a valid position and opens pathways toward (8, 6).\n\n### Strategic Consideration\nI'm deciding between moving LEFT or RIGHT. If I move LEFT to (4, 8), I am still not getting closer to any apples, but I will open up my options for the next round. If I move RIGHT to (6, 8), it will keep me closer to the direction of the apple at (8, 6) and potentially allow smoother access towards the top row soon.\n\n### Conclusion\nI have two equally valid paths before me; however, moving RIGHT (6, 8) is a more engaging choice, keeping me aligned with future apple chasing.\n\nDecided next move: **RIGHT**"

Let's evaluate my current surroundings and available options:\n\n- **Current position**: (7, 6)\n- **Length of my snake**: Increased by 1 last turn when I ate the apple at (8, 6).\n\n### Nearby Apples\nRemaining apples are located at:\n- (8, 0)\n- (6, 9)\n- (4, 3)  \nNote: There are no apples immediately adjacent to my current position.\n\n### Enemy Snake Position\n- **Snake #2** remains at (1, 2) with body segments extending upwards. I am still far, providing room to maneuver without threats.\n\n### Available Moves from (7, 6)\n1. **UP to (7, 7)**: This is an empty space; valid move but doesn't gain points.\n2. **DOWN to (7, 5)**: Similarly an empty space; valid but also doesn't lead to points.\n3. **LEFT to (6, 6)**: Empty space; not leading towards an apple.\n4. **RIGHT to (8, 6)**: Would move me back to my previous position, which is not allowed.\n\n### Evaluation of Moves:\n- **UP (7, 7)**: Get closer to the top row and potentially explore options for unblocked paths.\n- **DOWN (7, 5)**: Moving further from apples but is valid.\n- **LEFT (6, 6)**: This path does not lead to any apples either; I'm effectively stalling.\n  \n### Moving Strategy\nSince I\u2019m not close to any apples right now, I need to reposition in a way that allows for future growth. The board has a few gaps of apples that I need to pursue and figure out routes for future moves to ensure I can consume apples when I get nearer.\n\n**Thought Process:**\n- To climb upwards might open pathways in higher rows.\n- Staying in this lower row could be limiting as I\u2019m not approaching any apple.\n  \nGiven the nature of the game and my current position, moving UP to (7, 7) could present future movement options without hitting walls or closing off potential routes.\n\n### Conclusion\nAfter considering the moves and potential strategies, my next move will be:\n\n**Move UP to (7, 7)**.\n\nDecided next move: **UP**."

Here\u2019s the coordinate breakdown:\n\n1. **Current Position**: (1, 7)\n2. **Total Apples**: 2 apples collected (one from (1, 7)).\n3. **Remaining Apples on Board**: \n   - (3, 2)\n   - (5, 2)\n   - (0, 4)\n   - (3, 0)\n\n4. **Enemy Snake Location**: Snake #2 is at (6, 1). It remains at a safe distance.\n5. **Potential Moves**:\n   - UP to (1, 8): valid but no apple.\n   - DOWN to (1, 6): valid but no apple, moving backward.\n   - LEFT to (0, 7): valid but no apple.\n   - RIGHT to (2, 7): valid but occupied by my own tail (the T).\n\nThe only option that doesn\u2019t hurt my movement is UP or DOWN; however, neither lead me to an apple. \n\n### Strategic Considerations\n\n1. **Objective**: I need to find a path toward more apples while ensuring I maintain safety from the enemy snake.\n2. **Next Moves**: Since I can\u2019t eat an apple on this turn, I need to strategize for future moves. Potential moves UP or DOWN could help position me better for my next turn.\n\n### Long-Term Plan\n\n1. **Reach Remaining Apples**: I could potentially aim for (3, 2), but I need to be cautious about the enemy snake. \n2. **Positioning**: Moving UP to (1, 8) or DOWN to (1, 6) could allow me flexibility in the next round to continue targeting apples.\n\nHowever, the best part of being in this position right now is I can take an upward path for visibility without risking a deadly collision, considering we're in an open area.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven I can\u2019t gain an immediate apple but want to progress on the board for better options next round:\n\n**Next move: UP** \n\nThis keeps possibilities open for the next turn while maintaining a safe distance from Snake #2."

Here\u2019s the coordinate breakdown:\n\n1. **Current Position**: (1, 7)\n2. **Total Apples**: 2 apples collected (one from (1, 7)).\n3. **Remaining Apples on Board**: \n   - (3, 2)\n   - (5, 2)\n   - (0, 4)\n   - (3, 0)\n\n4. **Enemy Snake Location**: Snake #2 is at (6, 1). It remains at a safe distance.\n5. **Potential Moves**:\n   - UP to (1, 8): valid but no apple.\n   - DOWN to (1, 6): valid but no apple, moving backward.\n   - LEFT to (0, 7): valid but no apple.\n   - RIGHT to (2, 7): valid but occupied by my own tail (the T).\n\nThe only option that doesn\u2019t hurt my movement is UP or DOWN; however, neither lead me to an apple. \n\n### Strategic Considerations\n\n1. **Objective**: I need to find a path toward more apples while ensuring I maintain safety from the enemy snake.\n2. **Next Moves**: Since I can\u2019t eat an apple on this turn, I need to strategize for future moves. Potential moves UP or DOWN could help position me better for my next turn.\n\n### Long-Term Plan\n\n1. **Reach Remaining Apples**: I could potentially aim for (3, 2), but I need to be cautious about the enemy snake. \n2. **Positioning**: Moving UP to (1, 8) or DOWN to (1, 6) could allow me flexibility in the next round to continue targeting apples.\n\nHowever, the best part of being in this position right now is I can take an upward path for visibility without risking a deadly collision, considering we're in an open area.\n\n### Decision\n\nGiven I can\u2019t gain an immediate apple but want to progress on the board for better options next round:\n\n**Next move: UP** \n\nThis keeps possibilities open for the next turn while maintaining a safe distance from Snake #2."
