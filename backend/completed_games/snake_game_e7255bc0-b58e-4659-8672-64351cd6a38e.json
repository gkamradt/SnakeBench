The closest from the current position, taking into consideration the walls and the enemy snake, is the apple at (0, 7).\n\n3. **Enemy Snake Consideration**:\n   - Snake #2 is currently at position (6, 3). This is distant enough to allow a safe move towards the apple at (0, 7) without immediate interference.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Navigation Strategy**:\n   - Moving directly left from (2,1) has no obstacles. Thus, pursuing the apple at (0, 7) involves steering left and upwards carefully while watching out for any potential movements from Snake #2.\n\n5. **Strategic Long Term Moves**:\n   - Given that the apples at (9, 6) and (8, 6) are clustered with another at (9, 9), planning a longer route post the apple at (0, 7) to navigate toward the upper right of the board can be considered, depending on the position and growth of Snake #2.\n\n6. **Immediate Next Step**:\n   - Make an initial move LEFT towards (1, 1), aiming to reach (0, 7). This route ensures safe navigation by keeping to the edge and avoiding any central board collision risks.\n\n7. **Next Strategic Steps**:\n   - From (0, 7), plan to gradually move UP towards the clustered apples if safe, keeping an eye on Snake #2's trajectory and any possible new apples that may appear closer. If Snake #2 begins to head towards the north or east, reevaluate the approach to the upper cluster of apples and potentially adjust to conserve life and maximize apple capture.\n\nDecided Next Move: LEFT.

The closest from the current position, taking into consideration the walls and the enemy snake, is the apple at (0, 7).\n\n3. **Enemy Snake Consideration**:\n   - Snake #2 is currently at position (6, 3). This is distant enough to allow a safe move towards the apple at (0, 7) without immediate interference.\n\n4. **Potential Risks and Navigation Strategy**:\n   - Moving directly left from (2,1) has no obstacles. Thus, pursuing the apple at (0, 7) involves steering left and upwards carefully while watching out for any potential movements from Snake #2.\n\n5. **Strategic Long Term Moves**:\n   - Given that the apples at (9, 6) and (8, 6) are clustered with another at (9, 9), planning a longer route post the apple at (0, 7) to navigate toward the upper right of the board can be considered, depending on the position and growth of Snake #2.\n\n6. **Immediate Next Step**:\n   - Make an initial move LEFT towards (1, 1), aiming to reach (0, 7). This route ensures safe navigation by keeping to the edge and avoiding any central board collision risks.\n\n7. **Next Strategic Steps**:\n   - From (0, 7), plan to gradually move UP towards the clustered apples if safe, keeping an eye on Snake #2's trajectory and any possible new apples that may appear closer. If Snake #2 begins to head towards the north or east, reevaluate the approach to the upper cluster of apples and potentially adjust to conserve life and maximize apple capture.\n\nDecided Next Move: LEFT.

To reach this apple, we must move UP, going straight from y=1 to y=7.\n\n3. **Enemy Snake Monitoring**:\n   - Snake #2 is at (6,4) and doesn't present an immediate threat to the apple at (0, 7) nor impede my current path. However, monitoring its movements is crucial to foresee potential confrontations or paths crossing.\n\n4. **Navigation and Risk Mitigation**:\n   - Moving UP from my current position (1,1) is clear of immediate obstacles. Continuous vertical movement will edge closer to the apple at (0, 7) safely.\n   - It's pivotal to avoid making sharp moves towards the center to prevent running into unforeseen hazards or the enemy snake.\n\n5. **Long-term Strategic Planning**:\n   - Upon acquiring the apple at (0, 7), the secondary target should then be navigating towards the upper right section (particularly towards the apples at (9, 6), (8, 6), and (9, 9)), depending on the position and movement of the enemy snake.\n   - A planned route post current target should leverage the top row turning right to loop around safely to the top-right section of the board.\n\n6. **Potential Future Moves**:\n   - If Snake #2 appears to move north or significantly close to my trajectory, reassess and possibly adapt to mitigate risks. Prioritize survival while maximizing apple consumption.\n\n7. **Immediate Next Step**:\n   - Move UP towards the apple at (0, 7). This direct progressive movement secures a clear path aligning with board boundaries minimizing risk.\n\n**Decided Next Move: UP**.

Incrementing from y=1 to y=7 should be straightforward and safe from any contact with the enemy snake.\n\n5. **Strategic Approach to Growth**:\n   - After obtaining the apple at (0, 7), the next strategic move should be evaluating the option to navigate eastward across the top or potentially swinging back down seeking other apple locations based on the enemy position and other game dynamics at that time.\n\n6. **Future Strategic Consideration**:\n   - Keep an eye on Snake #2's movements to preempt any countering or aggressive strategy that may endanger advancing paths or apple claims.\n\n7. **Immediate Goal**:\n   - Pursue the apple at (0, 7) by continuing upward. This straightforward approach increases point potential while maintaining safety.\n\n**Next Move Decision: UP** \n- Proceeding UP aligns with the strategic goal to secure the nearest apple. This move also keeps in alignment with the vertical trajectory, minimizing the risk of unnecessary horizontal movement where other unknowns might interfere."

This is directly above my current position requiring consecutive upward movements.\n\n3. **Enemy Snake Situational Awareness**:\n   - Snake #2 is positioned at (7, 4) and remains reasonably distant from my current path towards (0, 7). There seems no immediate threat from this snake impacting my current objective.\n\n4. **Path Safety and Obstacles**:\n   - The path upwards remains clear with no obstacles. Incrementing from y=1 to y=7 should be straightforward and safe from any contact with the enemy snake.\n\n5. **Strategic Approach to Growth**:\n   - After obtaining the apple at (0, 7), the next strategic move should be evaluating the option to navigate eastward across the top or potentially swinging back down seeking other apple locations based on the enemy position and other game dynamics at that time.\n\n6. **Future Strategic Consideration**:\n   - Keep an eye on Snake #2's movements to preempt any countering or aggressive strategy that may endanger advancing paths or apple claims.\n\n7. **Immediate Goal**:\n   - Pursue the apple at (0, 7) by continuing upward. This straightforward approach increases point potential while maintaining safety.\n\n**Next Move Decision: UP** \n- Proceeding UP aligns with the strategic goal to secure the nearest apple. This move also keeps in alignment with the vertical trajectory, minimizing the risk of unnecessary horizontal movement where other unknowns might interfere."

This trajectory is currently the safest and most efficient given other coordinates are clear.\n- Since my last direction was UP and continuing this trajectory aligns with strategic goals, maintaining this direction is logical.\n\n**Future Consideration Post-Apple Collection:**\n- Once the apple at (0, 7) is collected, I'll need to reassess the board for the next nearest target. Potential targets could include the apples at (6, 8) or the cluster at (8, 6) and (9, 6). Considering these targets will depend on the situational position of Snake #2 and any changes in the board dynamics.\n\n**Immediate Decision and Next Steps:**\n- Given there are no impediments directly above, and moving UP continues to align with the most efficient route to securing the apple, my movement will be UP.\n\nConcluding with my decided next move: **UP**."

Given the lack of enemy snakes or body parts on your direct path upward and no walls obstruct within the playing grid, the passage is clear.\n\n**Avoiding Potential Hazards**:\n- The enemy snake, Snake #2, is positioned much farther on the board at (9, 5). It currently does not intersect with the vertical upward path from your current position (it may have seemed there was a minor inconsistency; your actual last known position being (0, 4), not (0, 1)).\n- No backtracking or wall-hitting issues as you continue moving upward.\n\n**Future Strategic Positioning Post Apple Acquisition**:\n- After collecting the apple at (0, 7), assessing the situation will be critical. Ideally, aim to plan a route towards richer apple zones while considering static obstacles and the movements of Snake #2. This may involve potentially switching to horizontal movements towards the center for other apple opportunities or fostering safe zones.\n\n**Decision for Immediate Next Move**:\n- Continue the upward movement to ensure that the apple at (0, 7) is collected with minimal risk and maximal point gain.\n- Keep satellite awareness of Snake #2's position to adapt plans reactively in subsequent moves.\n\n### Decided Next Move: UP.\n- Let's go ahead and secure that apple, and make further decisions based on updated information next turn."
