Its body is currently empty, so it\u2019s just a single segment.\n\n### Board Analysis\n- The closest apple to me is at (2, 1), which is just one step up.\n- The apple at (0, 4) is also relatively close, but it\u2019s two steps left and four steps up.\n- The apples at (6, 9) and (9, 4) are far away, so I\u2019ll ignore them for now.\n- The apple at (6, 6) is also a bit far, but it\u2019s worth considering later.\n\n### Potential Moves\n1. **UP**: Move to (2, 1) to grab the apple there. This is the quickest way to gain a point.\n2. **LEFT**: Move to (1, 0). This doesn\u2019t get me closer to any apples immediately.\n3. **RIGHT**: Move to (3, 0). This also doesn\u2019t get me closer to any apples immediately.\n4. **DOWN**: Move to (2, -1). This is outside the board, so I\u2019d die.\n\n### Strategy\n- My primary goal is to collect apples while avoiding collisions.\n- Since the apple at (2, 1) is just one step away, it\u2019s the most efficient move.\n- After grabbing this apple, I can consider moving towards the next closest apple or avoiding the enemy snake.\n\n### Decision\nI\u2019ll move **UP** to (2, 1) to grab the apple there. This will give me a point and grow my snake.\n\n**Next move: UP**"

            "rationale": "To analyze the situation, let's identify the available apple options and potential risks. There are three apples within reach: (0, 4), (6, 6), and (9, 4). The first apple at (0, 4) is the closest but moving down could put us at risk of colliding with Snake #1. The second apple at (6, 6) seems safer, but it requires moving a considerable distance. The third apple at (9, 4) is also within reach, but moving to the right could lead to a collision with Snake #1 if it moves in the same direction next turn.\n\nStrategy: To minimize risks and maximize chances of survival, it's better to move towards the second apple at (6, 6) gradually. This way, we can avoid immediate collisions and still have a chance to eat an apple.\n\nNext move: LEFT"
