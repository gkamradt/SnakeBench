There's no immediate benefit or threat avoidance in heading right now.\n\n- **UP (4, 10)**: This would go out of bounds, which is not allowed and would result in a loss.\n\n- **LEFT (3, 9)**: Similarly, moving left takes me away from the current apple target and doesn't present any strategic advantage.\n\n- **DOWN (4, 8)**: Heading down is the most logical choice as it takes me closer to the apple at (4, 5). This move should be part of a careful plan to avoid any unnecessary risks from the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategic Thought for Next Turn**:\n- Monitor the movement pattern of the enemy snake to avoid conflict areas.\n- Focus on acquiring the apple at (4, 5) while planning an escape path after consumption in case the board situation changes or enemy snake threatens my position.\n\nFor the current move, the best and logical decision is:\n\n**Decided Move**: DOWN"
