However, moving up would bring me closer to the apples at (7, 0) and (4, 8).\n\nMoving left would take me to (5, 9), but there's no apple there. However, moving left would bring me closer to the apples at (1, 7) and (2, 4).\n\nMoving right would take me to (7, 9), but there's no apple there. However, moving right would bring me closer to the apples at (2, 7) and (7, 0).\n\nGiven that I'm currently at the top of the board, moving up is not a viable option. I'll prioritize moving towards the apples that are further away from me, which are at (1, 7) and (7, 0).\n\nStrategy for next turn: Try to move towards the apple at (1, 7) first, as it's further away from me. If I can't reach it in one move, I'll adjust my strategy based on the board state at that time.\n\nNext move: LEFT."

There are five apples on the board, and the closest one is at (8, 4).\n\nStrategy: To avoid immediate danger and secure points, let's move towards the closest apple while keeping an eye on the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: LEFT (to position (0, 8))"
