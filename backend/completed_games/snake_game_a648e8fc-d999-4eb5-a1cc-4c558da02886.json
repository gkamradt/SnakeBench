This move strategically positions the snake closer to the central and lower regions of the board, where multiple apples are accessible. By moving down, the snake enhances its opportunities for point accumulation by approaching several apples at (3, 2), (6, 2), and (7, 2). Additionally, this move maintains a safe distance from the enemy snake, minimizing collision risks. While moving left offers proximity to the apple at (0, 0), it brings the snake closer to the board's edge, potentially restricting future movement options.\n\n  **Future Strategy:**\n\n  After moving down to (1, 7), the snake should prioritize navigating towards clusters of apples to maximize point gains efficiently. Maintaining central positioning allows for greater flexibility in responding to both available apples and the movements of enemy snakes. Continuous monitoring of enemy positions will be crucial to avoid potential conflicts, especially as both snakes vie for the same resources. By strategically collecting apples and avoiding hazards, the snake can steadily accumulate points while ensuring its survival throughout the game.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** **DOWN**"

This direction strategically advances the snake towards the lower part of the board, where a cluster of apples is available.

Additionally, maintaining movement in this direction keeps the snake safely distant from the enemy snake's current position, reducing the risk of imminent collisions.\n\n  While moving **LEFT** offers proximity to the apple at (0, 0), it confines the snake closer to the board's edge, potentially limiting its maneuverability in future turns. On the other hand, moving **RIGHT** does not provide immediate benefits in terms of apple collection and might lead to increased competition with the enemy snake.\n\n  Continuing to move **DOWN** aligns with a strategy focused on efficiently collecting apples while maintaining safety from both walls and enemy snakes.

Additionally, maintaining movement in this direction keeps the snake safely distant from the enemy snake's current position, reducing the risk of imminent collisions.\n\n  While moving **LEFT** offers proximity to the apple at (0, 0), it confines the snake closer to the board's edge, potentially limiting its maneuverability in future turns. On the other hand, moving **RIGHT** does not provide immediate benefits in terms of apple collection and might lead to increased competition with the enemy snake.\n\n  Continuing to move **DOWN** aligns with a strategy focused on efficiently collecting apples while maintaining safety from both walls and enemy snakes.

Additionally, this move maintains a safe distance from the enemy snake, minimizing collision risks. While moving left offers proximity to the apple at (0, 0), it brings the snake closer to the board's edge, potentially restricting future movement options.\n\n  **Future Strategy:**\n\n  After moving down to (1, 7), the snake should prioritize navigating towards clusters of apples to maximize point gains efficiently. Maintaining central positioning allows for greater flexibility in responding to both available apples and the movements of enemy snakes. Continuous monitoring of enemy positions will be crucial to avoid potential conflicts, especially as both snakes vie for the same resources. By strategically collecting apples and avoiding hazards, the snake can steadily accumulate points while ensuring its survival throughout the game.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** **DOWN**"

This direction strategically advances the snake towards the lower part of the board, where a cluster of apples is available.

Additionally, maintaining movement in this direction keeps the snake safely distant from the enemy snake's current position, reducing the risk of imminent collisions.\n\n  While moving **LEFT** offers proximity to the apple at (0, 0), it confines the snake closer to the board's edge, potentially limiting its maneuverability in future turns.
