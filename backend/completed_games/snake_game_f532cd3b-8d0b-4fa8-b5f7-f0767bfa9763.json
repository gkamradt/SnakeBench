            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out where to move my snake next. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 2 and is currently at (6,7). The enemy snake, ID 1, is at (1,9) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. The apples are located at (0,6), (3,5), (7,3), (7,9), and (7,5).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see that the apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. My snake is at (6,7), which is in the upper middle part of the board. The enemy snake is at (1,9), which is near the top left, so it's not immediately threatening me unless it moves towards me.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for next. The apples at (7,3), (7,5), and (7,9) are all along the right side of the board, which is column 7. The apple at (3,5) is in the middle, and (0,6) is on the left side.\n\nSince I'm at (6,7), moving right would take me towards column 7, which has three apples. That might be a good strategy because I can potentially collect multiple apples if I move in that direction. Alternatively, moving left towards (0,6) would require me to go all the way to the left, which is a longer distance.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves from my current position. From (6,7), I can move up to (6,8), down to (6,6), left to (5,7), or right to (7,7). \n\nIf I move right to (7,7), I'm one step closer to the apple at (7,9). From there, I can move up twice to reach (7,9) and collect that apple. That seems doable. Alternatively, moving down to (6,6) might lead me towards the apple at (3,5), but that's a longer path.\n\nI should also check if moving right is safe. The enemy snake is at (1,9), so it's not blocking my path. Also, I need to make sure I don't run into myself. Since my body is only at (6,7) right now, moving right to (7,7) is safe as long as I don't reverse direction later.\n\nAnother consideration is the other apples. The apple at (7,5) is also on the right side, but it's lower down. If I go for (7,9) first, I can then move down to (7,5) if possible. The apple at (7,3) is even lower, so that would require more steps.\n\nI think the best immediate move is to go right towards (7,7). That way, I can start moving towards the apple at (7,9) without any obstacles. Plus, being on the right side might give me more options for future moves, especially if the enemy snake decides to come down.\n\nWait, but I should also check if moving right is the optimal path. Let me visualize the board. From (6,7), moving right to (7,7) is a safe move. From there, moving up to (7,8) and then to (7,9) would collect that apple. That's two moves ahead. Alternatively, if I move down first, I might miss the opportunity to collect the higher apple quickly.\n\nI think the key here is to maximize points by collecting as many apples as possible. Since the apples on the right are closer, it's better to go for them first. Plus, the enemy snake is not in the way, so I don't have to worry about it interfering immediately.\n\nSo, my plan is to move right to (7,7) next, then up to (7,8), and then up again to (7,9) to collect that apple. After that, I can move down to (7,5) and then further down to (7,3) if possible. This way, I can collect three apples on the right side without much backtracking.\n\nI should also make sure that moving right doesn't put me in a position where I can't move further because of walls or the enemy. Since the board is 10x10, moving right from (7,7) to (8,7) is still within bounds, and beyond that to (9,7). So, no immediate wall issues.\n\nIn terms of safety, I don't see any part of my body in that path, so I won't be running into myself. The enemy snake is far away, so unless it moves towards me, I should be fine.\n\nTherefore, the best next move is to go right to (7,7). This sets me up to collect the apple at (7,9) in two more moves, which is a good strategy for maximizing points.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move RIGHT to (7,7) to start collecting apples on the right side of the board.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** My snake is at (6,7).\n2. **Apple Locations:** Apples are at (0,6), (3,5), (7,3), (7,5), and (7,9).\n3. **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 is at (1,9), not blocking my path.\n4. **Possible Moves:** From (6,7), I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n5. **Safety Check:** Moving RIGHT to (7,7) is safe as there are no obstacles.\n6. **Strategic Advantage:** Moving towards the right allows me to collect multiple apples (7,9), (7,5), and (7,3) in subsequent moves.\n7. **Optimal Path:** Moving RIGHT sets me up to collect the highest apple first, then proceed down.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"

Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 2 and is currently at (6,7). The enemy snake, ID 1, is at (1,9) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. The apples are located at (0,6), (3,5), (7,3), (7,9), and (7,5).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see that the apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. My snake is at (6,7), which is in the upper middle part of the board. The enemy snake is at (1,9), which is near the top left, so it's not immediately threatening me unless it moves towards me.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for next. The apples at (7,3), (7,5), and (7,9) are all along the right side of the board, which is column 7. The apple at (3,5) is in the middle, and (0,6) is on the left side.\n\nSince I'm at (6,7), moving right would take me towards column 7, which has three apples. That might be a good strategy because I can potentially collect multiple apples if I move in that direction. Alternatively, moving left towards (0,6) would require me to go all the way to the left, which is a longer distance.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves from my current position. From (6,7), I can move up to (6,8), down to (6,6), left to (5,7), or right to (7,7). \n\nIf I move right to (7,7), I'm one step closer to the apple at (7,9). From there, I can move up twice to reach (7,9) and collect that apple. That seems doable. Alternatively, moving down to (6,6) might lead me towards the apple at (3,5), but that's a longer path.\n\nI should also check if moving right is safe. The enemy snake is at (1,9), so it's not blocking my path. Also, I need to make sure I don't run into myself.

The apple at (7,5) is also on the right side, but it's lower down. If I go for (7,9) first, I can then move down to (7,5) if possible. The apple at (7,3) is even lower, so that would require more steps.\n\nI think the best immediate move is to go right towards (7,7). That way, I can start moving towards the apple at (7,9) without any obstacles. Plus, being on the right side might give me more options for future moves, especially if the enemy snake decides to come down.\n\nWait, but I should also check if moving right is the optimal path. Let me visualize the board. From (6,7), moving right to (7,7) is a safe move. From there, moving up to (7,8) and then to (7,9) would collect that apple. That's two moves ahead.

After that, I can move down to (7,5) and then further down to (7,3) if possible. This way, I can collect three apples on the right side without much backtracking.\n\nI should also make sure that moving right doesn't put me in a position where I can't move further because of walls or the enemy. Since the board is 10x10, moving right from (7,7) to (8,7) is still within bounds, and beyond that to (9,7).

This way, I can collect three apples on the right side without much backtracking.\n\nI should also make sure that moving right doesn't put me in a position where I can't move further because of walls or the enemy.

The enemy snake is far away, so unless it moves towards me, I should be fine.\n\nTherefore, the best next move is to go right to (7,7).

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out where to move my snake next. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 2 and is currently at (6,7). The enemy snake, ID 1, is at (1,9) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. The apples are located at (0,6), (3,5), (7,3), (7,9), and (7,5).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see that the apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. My snake is at (6,7), which is in the upper middle part of the board. The enemy snake is at (1,9), which is near the top left, so it's not immediately threatening me unless it moves towards me.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for next. The apples at (7,3), (7,5), and (7,9) are all along the right side of the board, which is column 7. The apple at (3,5) is in the middle, and (0,6) is on the left side.\n\nSince I'm at (6,7), moving right would take me towards column 7, which has three apples. That might be a good strategy because I can potentially collect multiple apples if I move in that direction. Alternatively, moving left towards (0,6) would require me to go all the way to the left, which is a longer distance.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves from my current position. From (6,7), I can move up to (6,8), down to (6,6), left to (5,7), or right to (7,7). \n\nIf I move right to (7,7), I'm one step closer to the apple at (7,9). From there, I can move up twice to reach (7,9) and collect that apple. That seems doable. Alternatively, moving down to (6,6) might lead me towards the apple at (3,5), but that's a longer path.\n\nI should also check if moving right is safe. The enemy snake is at (1,9), so it's not blocking my path. Also, I need to make sure I don't run into myself. Since my body is only at (6,7) right now, moving right to (7,7) is safe as long as I don't reverse direction later.\n\nAnother consideration is the other apples. The apple at (7,5) is also on the right side, but it's lower down. If I go for (7,9) first, I can then move down to (7,5) if possible. The apple at (7,3) is even lower, so that would require more steps.\n\nI think the best immediate move is to go right towards (7,7). That way, I can start moving towards the apple at (7,9) without any obstacles. Plus, being on the right side might give me more options for future moves, especially if the enemy snake decides to come down.\n\nWait, but I should also check if moving right is the optimal path. Let me visualize the board. From (6,7), moving right to (7,7) is a safe move. From there, moving up to (7,8) and then to (7,9) would collect that apple. That's two moves ahead. Alternatively, if I move down first, I might miss the opportunity to collect the higher apple quickly.\n\nI think the key here is to maximize points by collecting as many apples as possible. Since the apples on the right are closer, it's better to go for them first. Plus, the enemy snake is not in the way, so I don't have to worry about it interfering immediately.\n\nSo, my plan is to move right to (7,7) next, then up to (7,8), and then up again to (7,9) to collect that apple. After that, I can move down to (7,5) and then further down to (7,3) if possible. This way, I can collect three apples on the right side without much backtracking.\n\nI should also make sure that moving right doesn't put me in a position where I can't move further because of walls or the enemy. Since the board is 10x10, moving right from (7,7) to (8,7) is still within bounds, and beyond that to (9,7). So, no immediate wall issues.\n\nIn terms of safety, I don't see any part of my body in that path, so I won't be running into myself. The enemy snake is far away, so unless it moves towards me, I should be fine.\n\nTherefore, the best next move is to go right to (7,7). This sets me up to collect the apple at (7,9) in two more moves, which is a good strategy for maximizing points.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** My snake is at (6,7).\n2. **Apple Locations:** Apples are at (0,6), (3,5), (7,3), (7,5), and (7,9).\n3. **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 is at (1,9), not blocking my path.\n4. **Possible Moves:** From (6,7), I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n5. **Safety Check:** Moving RIGHT to (7,7) is safe as there are no obstacles.\n6. **Strategic Advantage:** Moving towards the right allows me to collect multiple apples (7,9), (7,5), and (7,3) in subsequent moves.\n7. **Optimal Path:** Moving RIGHT sets me up to collect the highest apple first, then proceed down.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n3) The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n</think>\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"

            "move": "UP",
            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board setup and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is at (9,7), which is the top right area of the board. The apples are located at (0,6), (3,5), (7,3), (7,5), and (7,9). The enemy snake is at (0,7) with an empty body, so it's not a threat right now.\n\nLooking at the board, I can see that the apples are spread out, but there are a few clusters. The apple at (7,9) is right above my current position, which is (9,7). If I move up, I can reach that apple quickly. However, moving up from (9,7) would take me to (9,8), which is one step closer to (9,9), but there's no apple there. Alternatively, moving right from (9,7) would take me to (10,7), which is outside the board, so that's not possible. Wait, no, the board is 10x10, so the coordinates go from 0 to 9. So moving right from (9,7) would actually take me to (9,8), not (10,7). Hmm, I think I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, no, the x-coordinate increases to the right, so moving right from (9,7) would actually take me to (10,7), which is outside the board. So that's not allowed. So my options are to move up, down, or left.\n\nMoving up from (9,7) would take me to (9,8), which is safe and closer to the apple at (7,9). But I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, moving left from (9,7) would take me to (8,7), which is also a safe move but doesn't get me closer to any apples immediately.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,9) is two steps up from (9,7). So moving up twice would get me there. But I also have other apples to consider. The apple at (7,5) is another one that's on the right side, but it's further down. The apple at (3,5) is more to the left, and (0,6) is even further left.\n\nI think the key here is to prioritize the closest apples. The apple at (7,9) is the closest to me, so maybe I should aim for that first. But I also need to consider the path and whether moving up is the best direction without running into any walls or the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board again, the enemy snake is at (0,7), which is on the opposite side, so it's not blocking my path. The body of the enemy snake is empty, so it's not a threat right now.\n\nSo, considering all this, moving up from (9,7) to (9,8) seems like a safe and strategic move because it gets me closer to the apple at (7,9) without any immediate obstacles. Plus, it's a step towards a high-value apple that I can collect in the next move if possible.\n\nWait, but if I move up to (9,8), I'm still two steps away from (9,9), which is the top right corner. The apple at (7,9) is at (7,9), so I'm two steps to the left of that. So maybe moving up isn't the most efficient. Alternatively, if I move left twice, I can get to (7,7), which is directly below the apple at (7,9). That might be a better path because then I can move up two steps to reach the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (9,7) is safe. The cell at (8,7) is empty, and (7,7) is also empty, so that's a safe path. However, I have to consider the direction I'm moving. If I move left, I'm going towards the lower x-coordinate, which might take me away from other apples, but in this case, the apple at (7,9) is more valuable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the other apples. The apple at (7,5) is also on the right side but lower down. If I move left to (7,7), I can then move down to (7,5) in two steps, collecting two apples in the process. That seems efficient.\n\nBut I need to think about the immediate next move. My current position is (9,7). If I move left, I go to (8,7). From there, moving left again would take me to (7,7), which is directly below the apple at (7,9). Then, moving up twice would get me to (7,9). Alternatively, from (7,7), I could move down to (7,5) to collect that apple.\n\nSo, considering that, moving left from (9,7) to (8,7) is a good first step because it opens up the possibility of collecting multiple apples in the future. However, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't put me in a position where I can't reach the apples without backtracking.\n\nWait, but if I move left to (8,7), I'm still two steps away from (7,7), and then from there, I can decide whether to go up or down. It seems like a solid plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left twice to (7,8) and then up to (7,9). That also works, but it's two moves instead of one. So, moving left first might be more efficient in the long run.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake. If the enemy snake starts moving towards me, I need to make sure I have an escape route. However, since the enemy snake is at (0,7), it's on the opposite side, so it's not a threat right now.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the other apples. The apple at (3,5) is on the left side, and (0,6) is even further left. If I move left, I might be moving away from those, but since they are further away, it's better to focus on the closer apples first.\n\nSo, to summarize, my options are:\n\n1. Move up to (9,8), then left to (7,8), then up to (7,9) to collect the apple there.\n2. Move left to (8,7), then left to (7,7), then up to (7,9) or down to (7,5).\n\nBoth paths seem viable, but moving left first might allow me to collect more apples in the future without backtracking. However, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't put me in a position where I can't reach the apples without getting stuck.\n\nWait, but if I move left to (8,7), I can then move left again to (7,7), and from there, I can decide to go up or down. That seems like a good strategy because it gives me flexibility.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). But that's two moves, whereas moving left first would allow me to collect the apple at (7,9) in two moves as well.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look at the board again.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (7,9) is at the top middle-right, and the apple at (7,5) is at the bottom middle-right. So, if I move left to (7,7), I can then move up to (7,9) or down to (7,5). That gives me two options for collecting apples, which is good.\n\nOn the other hand, if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). But that's a longer path, and I might be missing out on the apple at (7,5).\n\nWait, but if I move left to (7,7), I can collect both apples at (7,9) and (7,5) in two moves each, which is efficient. So, moving left first seems better.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (9,7) is safe. The cell at (8,7) is empty, and (7,7) is also empty, so that's safe.\n\nSo, my next move should be to move left to (8,7). That way, I can then proceed towards either (7,9) or (7,5) depending on which is more advantageous.\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,9) is only two steps up from (7,7), while the apple at (7,5) is two steps down. So, if I move left to (7,7), I can choose to go up or down based on which apple is more valuable or which path is safer.\n\nBut in this case, both apples are worth the same, so it's a matter of which one I can reach first. Since I'm at (9,7), moving left to (8,7) and then to (7,7) is two moves, and then I can decide to go up or down.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up first to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). That's also three moves, but I might be able to collect the apple at (7,9) in the next move.\n\nWait, but if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). That's two moves from my current position. So, moving up first might allow me to collect the apple at (7,9) in two moves, whereas moving left first would take three moves.\n\nHmm, that's a good point. So, moving up first might be more efficient in terms of time to collect the apple at (7,9).\n\nBut I also have the apple at (7,5) to consider. If I move up to (9,8), then left to (7,8), and then down to (7,7), I can then move down to (7,5). That would take four moves, whereas if I move left first, I can collect both apples in fewer moves.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to outline the possible paths:\n\nOption 1: Move up to (9,8), then left to (7,8), then up to (7,9) to collect the apple there. That's three moves.\n\nOption 2: Move left to (8,7), then left to (7,7), then up to (7,9). That's also three moves.\n\nSo, both options take the same number of moves to collect the apple at (7,9). However, if I choose Option 2, I can then move down to (7,5) in one more move, collecting two apples in four moves. If I choose Option 1, I can collect the apple at (7,9) in three moves, and then I would need to move down to (7,5) in two more moves, totaling five moves.\n\nSo, Option 2 seems more efficient because I can collect both apples in four moves instead of five.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider the immediate next move. My current position is (9,7). If I move up to (9,8), that's safe. If I move left to (8,7), that's also safe.\n\nI think the key is to get closer to the apples as quickly as possible. Since both (7,9) and (7,5) are on the same x-coordinate, moving to (7,7) would allow me to access both apples with minimal movement.\n\nTherefore, moving left to (8,7) is the first step towards that goal. From there, I can move left again to (7,7), and then decide to go up or down based on which apple is more advantageous.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up first, I can reach (7,9) in three moves, but then I have to backtrack to reach (7,5), which might not be as efficient.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think moving left to (8,7) is the best immediate move because it sets me up for collecting both apples at (7,9) and (7,5) in the future without backtracking.\n\nWait, but I also have the apple at (3,5) and (0,6) to consider. Those are on the left side, but they are further away. It's better to collect the closer apples first before moving on to the farther ones.\n\nSo, focusing on (7,9) and (7,5) makes sense. Therefore, moving left to (8,7) is the optimal first step.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because moving up to (9,8) also seems like a good move towards (7,9). Maybe I should think about the direction that gets me closer to the most apples.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (7,9) is directly above (7,7), and the apple at (7,5) is directly below. So, being at (7,7) gives me access to both. Therefore, moving left to (8,7) is better because it's the first step towards (7,7), which is a strategic position.\n\nIn contrast, moving up to (9,8) only gets me closer to (7,9) but doesn't help me with (7,5). So, moving left seems more advantageous in the long run.\n\nAnother consideration is the enemy snake. If the enemy snake starts moving towards me, I need to have an escape route. But since the enemy snake is at (0,7), it's on the opposite side, so it's not a threat right now. Therefore, I don't need to worry about it for the immediate move.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't put me in a position where I can't move further left without hitting a wall or the enemy snake. Since (7,7) is within the board and there's no snake there, it's safe.\n\nSo, after considering all these factors, I think moving left to (8,7) is the best next move. It positions me strategically to collect multiple apples in the future without backtracking and avoids any immediate threats.\n</think>\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n\n**Strategy:** Moving left to (8,7) positions me strategically to collect multiple apples in the future, particularly those at (7,9) and (7,5), without backtracking. This move sets up a flexible path towards higher-value apples while avoiding immediate threats."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out where to move my snake next. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 2 and is currently at (6,7). The enemy snake, ID 1, is at (1,9) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. The apples are located at (0,6), (3,5), (7,3), (7,9), and (7,5).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see that the apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. My snake is at (6,7), which is in the upper middle part of the board. The enemy snake is at (1,9), which is near the top left, so it's not immediately threatening me unless it moves towards me.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for next. The apples at (7,3), (7,5), and (7,9) are all along the right side of the board, which is column 7. The apple at (3,5) is in the middle, and (0,6) is on the left side.\n\nSince I'm at (6,7), moving right would take me towards column 7, which has three apples. That might be a good strategy because I can potentially collect multiple apples if I move in that direction. Alternatively, moving left towards (0,6) would require me to go all the way to the left, which is a longer distance.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves from my current position. From (6,7), I can move up to (6,8), down to (6,6), left to (5,7), or right to (7,7). \n\nIf I move right to (7,7), I'm one step closer to the apple at (7,9). From there, I can move up twice to reach (7,9) and collect that apple. That seems doable. Alternatively, moving down to (6,6) might lead me towards the apple at (3,5), but that's a longer path.\n\nI should also check if moving right is safe. The enemy snake is at (1,9), so it's not blocking my path. Also, I need to make sure I don't run into myself. Since my body is only at (6,7) right now, moving right to (7,7) is safe as long as I don't reverse direction later.\n\nAnother consideration is the other apples. The apple at (7,5) is also on the right side, but it's lower down. If I go for (7,9) first, I can then move down to (7,5) if possible. The apple at (7,3) is even lower, so that would require more steps.\n\nI think the best immediate move is to go right towards (7,7). That way, I can start moving towards the apple at (7,9) without any obstacles. Plus, being on the right side might give me more options for future moves, especially if the enemy snake decides to come down.\n\nWait, but I should also check if moving right is the optimal path. Let me visualize the board. From (6,7), moving right to (7,7) is a safe move. From there, moving up to (7,8) and then to (7,9) would collect that apple. That's two moves ahead. Alternatively, if I move down first, I might miss the opportunity to collect the higher apple quickly.\n\nI think the key here is to maximize points by collecting as many apples as possible. Since the apples on the right are closer, it's better to go for them first. Plus, the enemy snake is not in the way, so I don't have to worry about it interfering immediately.\n\nSo, my plan is to move right to (7,7) next, then up to (7,8), and then up again to (7,9) to collect that apple. After that, I can move down to (7,5) and then further down to (7,3) if possible. This way, I can collect three apples on the right side without much backtracking.\n\nI should also make sure that moving right doesn't put me in a position where I can't move further because of walls or the enemy. Since the board is 10x10, moving right from (7,7) to (8,7) is still within bounds, and beyond that to (9,7). So, no immediate wall issues.\n\nIn terms of safety, I don't see any part of my body in that path, so I won't be running into myself. The enemy snake is far away, so unless it moves towards me, I should be fine.\n\nTherefore, the best next move is to go right to (7,7). This sets me up to collect the apple at (7,9) in two more moves, which is a good strategy for maximizing points.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move RIGHT to (7,7) to start collecting apples on the right side of the board.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** My snake is at (6,7).\n2. **Apple Locations:** Apples are at (0,6), (3,5), (7,3), (7,5), and (7,9).\n3. **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 is at (1,9), not blocking my path.\n4. **Possible Moves:** From (6,7), I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n5. **Safety Check:** Moving RIGHT to (7,7) is safe as there are no obstacles.\n6. **Strategic Advantage:** Moving towards the right allows me to collect multiple apples (7,9), (7,5), and (7,3) in subsequent moves.\n7. **Optimal Path:** Moving RIGHT sets me up to collect the highest apple first, then proceed down.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board setup and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is at (9,7), which is the top right area of the board. The apples are located at (0,6), (3,5), (7,3), (7,5), and (7,9). The enemy snake is at (0,7) with an empty body, so it's not a threat right now.\n\nLooking at the board, I can see that the apples are spread out, but there are a few clusters. The apple at (7,9) is right above my current position, which is (9,7). If I move up, I can reach that apple quickly. However, moving up from (9,7) would take me to (9,8), which is one step closer to (9,9), but there's no apple there. Alternatively, moving right from (9,7) would take me to (10,7), which is outside the board, so that's not possible. Wait, no, the board is 10x10, so the coordinates go from 0 to 9. So moving right from (9,7) would actually take me to (9,8), not (10,7). Hmm, I think I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, no, the x-coordinate increases to the right, so moving right from (9,7) would actually take me to (10,7), which is outside the board. So that's not allowed. So my options are to move up, down, or left.\n\nMoving up from (9,7) would take me to (9,8), which is safe and closer to the apple at (7,9). But I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, moving left from (9,7) would take me to (8,7), which is also a safe move but doesn't get me closer to any apples immediately.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,9) is two steps up from (9,7). So moving up twice would get me there. But I also have other apples to consider. The apple at (7,5) is another one that's on the right side, but it's further down. The apple at (3,5) is more to the left, and (0,6) is even further left.\n\nI think the key here is to prioritize the closest apples. The apple at (7,9) is the closest to me, so maybe I should aim for that first. But I also need to consider the path and whether moving up is the best direction without running into any walls or the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board again, the enemy snake is at (0,7), which is on the opposite side, so it's not blocking my path. The body of the enemy snake is empty, so it's not a threat right now.\n\nSo, considering all this, moving up from (9,7) to (9,8) seems like a safe and strategic move because it gets me closer to the apple at (7,9) without any immediate obstacles. Plus, it's a step towards a high-value apple that I can collect in the next move if possible.\n\nWait, but if I move up to (9,8), I'm still two steps away from (9,9), which is the top right corner. The apple at (7,9) is at (7,9), so I'm two steps to the left of that. So maybe moving up isn't the most efficient. Alternatively, if I move left twice, I can get to (7,7), which is directly below the apple at (7,9). That might be a better path because then I can move up two steps to reach the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (9,7) is safe. The cell at (8,7) is empty, and (7,7) is also empty, so that's a safe path. However, I have to consider the direction I'm moving. If I move left, I'm going towards the lower x-coordinate, which might take me away from other apples, but in this case, the apple at (7,9) is more valuable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the other apples. The apple at (7,5) is also on the right side but lower down. If I move left to (7,7), I can then move down to (7,5) in two steps, collecting two apples in the process. That seems efficient.\n\nBut I need to think about the immediate next move. My current position is (9,7). If I move left, I go to (8,7). From there, moving left again would take me to (7,7), which is directly below the apple at (7,9). Then, moving up twice would get me to (7,9). Alternatively, from (7,7), I could move down to (7,5) to collect that apple.\n\nSo, considering that, moving left from (9,7) to (8,7) is a good first step because it opens up the possibility of collecting multiple apples in the future. However, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't put me in a position where I can't reach the apples without backtracking.\n\nWait, but if I move left to (8,7), I'm still two steps away from (7,7), and then from there, I can decide whether to go up or down. It seems like a solid plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left twice to (7,8) and then up to (7,9). That also works, but it's two moves instead of one. So, moving left first might be more efficient in the long run.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake. If the enemy snake starts moving towards me, I need to make sure I have an escape route. However, since the enemy snake is at (0,7), it's on the opposite side, so it's not a threat right now.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the other apples. The apple at (3,5) is on the left side, and (0,6) is even further left. If I move left, I might be moving away from those, but since they are further away, it's better to focus on the closer apples first.\n\nSo, to summarize, my options are:\n\n1. Move up to (9,8), then left to (7,8), then up to (7,9) to collect the apple there.\n2. Move left to (8,7), then left to (7,7), then up to (7,9) or down to (7,5).\n\nBoth paths seem viable, but moving left first might allow me to collect more apples in the future without backtracking. However, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't put me in a position where I can't reach the apples without getting stuck.\n\nWait, but if I move left to (8,7), I can then move left again to (7,7), and from there, I can decide to go up or down. That seems like a good strategy because it gives me flexibility.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). But that's two moves, whereas moving left first would allow me to collect the apple at (7,9) in two moves as well.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look at the board again.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (7,9) is at the top middle-right, and the apple at (7,5) is at the bottom middle-right. So, if I move left to (7,7), I can then move up to (7,9) or down to (7,5). That gives me two options for collecting apples, which is good.\n\nOn the other hand, if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). But that's a longer path, and I might be missing out on the apple at (7,5).\n\nWait, but if I move left to (7,7), I can collect both apples at (7,9) and (7,5) in two moves each, which is efficient. So, moving left first seems better.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (9,7) is safe. The cell at (8,7) is empty, and (7,7) is also empty, so that's safe.\n\nSo, my next move should be to move left to (8,7). That way, I can then proceed towards either (7,9) or (7,5) depending on which is more advantageous.\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,9) is only two steps up from (7,7), while the apple at (7,5) is two steps down. So, if I move left to (7,7), I can choose to go up or down based on which apple is more valuable or which path is safer.\n\nBut in this case, both apples are worth the same, so it's a matter of which one I can reach first. Since I'm at (9,7), moving left to (8,7) and then to (7,7) is two moves, and then I can decide to go up or down.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up first to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). That's also three moves, but I might be able to collect the apple at (7,9) in the next move.\n\nWait, but if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). That's two moves from my current position. So, moving up first might allow me to collect the apple at (7,9) in two moves, whereas moving left first would take three moves.\n\nHmm, that's a good point. So, moving up first might be more efficient in terms of time to collect the apple at (7,9).\n\nBut I also have the apple at (7,5) to consider. If I move up to (9,8), then left to (7,8), and then down to (7,7), I can then move down to (7,5). That would take four moves, whereas if I move left first, I can collect both apples in fewer moves.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to outline the possible paths:\n\nOption 1: Move up to (9,8), then left to (7,8), then up to (7,9) to collect the apple there. That's three moves.\n\nOption 2: Move left to (8,7), then left to (7,7), then up to (7,9). That's also three moves.\n\nSo, both options take the same number of moves to collect the apple at (7,9). However, if I choose Option 2, I can then move down to (7,5) in one more move, collecting two apples in four moves. If I choose Option 1, I can collect the apple at (7,9) in three moves, and then I would need to move down to (7,5) in two more moves, totaling five moves.\n\nSo, Option 2 seems more efficient because I can collect both apples in four moves instead of five.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider the immediate next move. My current position is (9,7). If I move up to (9,8), that's safe. If I move left to (8,7), that's also safe.\n\nI think the key is to get closer to the apples as quickly as possible. Since both (7,9) and (7,5) are on the same x-coordinate, moving to (7,7) would allow me to access both apples with minimal movement.\n\nTherefore, moving left to (8,7) is the first step towards that goal. From there, I can move left again to (7,7), and then decide to go up or down based on which apple is more advantageous.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up first, I can reach (7,9) in three moves, but then I have to backtrack to reach (7,5), which might not be as efficient.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think moving left to (8,7) is the best immediate move because it sets me up for collecting both apples at (7,9) and (7,5) in the future without backtracking.\n\nWait, but I also have the apple at (3,5) and (0,6) to consider. Those are on the left side, but they are further away. It's better to collect the closer apples first before moving on to the farther ones.\n\nSo, focusing on (7,9) and (7,5) makes sense. Therefore, moving left to (8,7) is the optimal first step.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because moving up to (9,8) also seems like a good move towards (7,9). Maybe I should think about the direction that gets me closer to the most apples.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (7,9) is directly above (7,7), and the apple at (7,5) is directly below. So, being at (7,7) gives me access to both. Therefore, moving left to (8,7) is better because it's the first step towards (7,7), which is a strategic position.\n\nIn contrast, moving up to (9,8) only gets me closer to (7,9) but doesn't help me with (7,5). So, moving left seems more advantageous in the long run.\n\nAnother consideration is the enemy snake. If the enemy snake starts moving towards me, I need to have an escape route. But since the enemy snake is at (0,7), it's on the opposite side, so it's not a threat right now. Therefore, I don't need to worry about it for the immediate move.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't put me in a position where I can't move further left without hitting a wall or the enemy snake. Since (7,7) is within the board and there's no snake there, it's safe.\n\nSo, after considering all these factors, I think moving left to (8,7) is the best next move. It positions me strategically to collect multiple apples in the future without backtracking and avoids any immediate threats.\n</think>\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n\n**Strategy:** Moving left to (8,7) positions me strategically to collect multiple apples in the future, particularly those at (7,9) and (7,5), without backtracking. This move sets up a flexible path towards higher-value apples while avoiding immediate threats."

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake. Let me start by understanding the current board setup and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is at (9,7), which is the top right area of the board. The apples are located at (0,6), (3,5), (7,3), (7,5), and (7,9). The enemy snake is at (0,7) with an empty body, so it's not a threat right now.\n\nLooking at the board, I can see that the apples are spread out, but there are a few clusters. The apple at (7,9) is right above my current position, which is (9,7). If I move up, I can reach that apple quickly. However, moving up from (9,7) would take me to (9,8), which is one step closer to (9,9), but there's no apple there. Alternatively, moving right from (9,7) would take me to (10,7), which is outside the board, so that's not possible. Wait, no, the board is 10x10, so the coordinates go from 0 to 9. So moving right from (9,7) would actually take me to (9,8), not (10,7). Hmm, I think I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, no, the x-coordinate increases to the right, so moving right from (9,7) would actually take me to (10,7), which is outside the board. So that's not allowed. So my options are to move up, down, or left.\n\nMoving up from (9,7) would take me to (9,8), which is safe and closer to the apple at (7,9). But I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, moving left from (9,7) would take me to (8,7), which is also a safe move but doesn't get me closer to any apples immediately.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,9) is two steps up from (9,7). So moving up twice would get me there. But I also have other apples to consider. The apple at (7,5) is another one that's on the right side, but it's further down. The apple at (3,5) is more to the left, and (0,6) is even further left.\n\nI think the key here is to prioritize the closest apples. The apple at (7,9) is the closest to me, so maybe I should aim for that first. But I also need to consider the path and whether moving up is the best direction without running into any walls or the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board again, the enemy snake is at (0,7), which is on the opposite side, so it's not blocking my path. The body of the enemy snake is empty, so it's not a threat right now.\n\nSo, considering all this, moving up from (9,7) to (9,8) seems like a safe and strategic move because it gets me closer to the apple at (7,9) without any immediate obstacles. Plus, it's a step towards a high-value apple that I can collect in the next move if possible.\n\nWait, but if I move up to (9,8), I'm still two steps away from (9,9), which is the top right corner. The apple at (7,9) is at (7,9), so I'm two steps to the left of that. So maybe moving up isn't the most efficient. Alternatively, if I move left twice, I can get to (7,7), which is directly below the apple at (7,9). That might be a better path because then I can move up two steps to reach the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (9,7) is safe. The cell at (8,7) is empty, and (7,7) is also empty, so that's a safe path. However, I have to consider the direction I'm moving. If I move left, I'm going towards the lower x-coordinate, which might take me away from other apples, but in this case, the apple at (7,9) is more valuable.\n\nAlternatively, if I move left to (8,7), I can then move left again to (7,7), and from there, I can decide to go up or down. That seems like a good strategy because it gives me flexibility.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the enemy snake. If the enemy snake starts moving towards me, I need to make sure I have an escape route. However, since the enemy snake is at (0,7), it's on the opposite side, so it's not a threat right now.\n\nSo, to summarize, my options are:\n\n1. Move up to (9,8), then left to (7,8), then up to (7,9) to collect the apple there.\n2. Move left to (8,7), then left to (7,7), then up to (7,9) or down to (7,5).\n\nBoth paths seem viable, but moving left first might allow me to collect more apples in the future without backtracking. However, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't put me in a position where I can't reach the apples without backtracking.\n\nWait, but if I move left to (8,7), I can then move left again to (7,7), and from there, I can decide to go up or down. That seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). But that's two moves, whereas moving left first would take three moves.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look at the board again.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (7,9) is at the top middle-right, and the apple at (7,5) is at the bottom middle-right. So, if I move left to (7,7), I can then move up to (7,9) or down to (7,5). That gives me two options for collecting apples, which is good.\n\nOn the other hand, if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). But that's a longer path, and I might be missing out on the apple at (7,5).\n\nWait, but if I move left to (7,7), I can collect both apples at (7,9) and (7,5) in two moves each, which is efficient. So, moving left first seems better.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (9,7) is safe. The cell at (8,7) is empty, and (7,7) is also empty, so that's safe.\n\nSo, my next move should be to move left to (8,7). That way, I can then proceed towards either (7,9) or (7,5) depending on which is more advantageous.\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,9) is only two steps up from (7,7), while the apple at (7,5) is two steps down. So, if I move left to (7,7), I can choose to go up or down based on which apple is more valuable or which path is safer.\n\nBut in this case, both apples are worth the same, so it's a matter of which one I can reach first. Since I'm at (9,7), moving left to (8,7) and then to (7,7) is two moves, and then I can decide to go up or down.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). That's also three moves, but I might be able to collect the apple at (7,9) in the next move.\n\nWait, but if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). That's two moves from my current position. So, moving up first might be more efficient in terms of time to collect the apple at (7,9).\n\nBut I also have the apple at (7,5) to consider. If I move up to (9,8), then left to (7,8), and then down to (7,7), I can then move down to (7,5). That would take four moves, whereas if I move left first, I can collect both apples in fewer moves.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to outline the possible paths:\n\nOption 1: Move up to (9,8), then left to (7,8), then up to (7,9) to collect the apple there.

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out where to move my snake next. Let me start by understanding the current board state and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, the board is 10x10, with coordinates from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. My snake is ID 2 and is currently at (6,7). The enemy snake, ID 1, is at (1,9) with an empty body, so it's just the head there. The apples are located at (0,6), (3,5), (7,3), (7,9), and (7,5).\n\nLooking at the board state, I can see that the apples are spread out, but some are closer than others. My snake is at (6,7), which is in the upper middle part of the board. The enemy snake is at (1,9), which is near the top left, so it's not immediately threatening me unless it moves towards me.\n\nI need to decide which apple to go for next. The apples at (7,3), (7,5), and (7,9) are all along the right side of the board, which is column 7. The apple at (3,5) is in the middle, and (0,6) is on the left side.\n\nSince I'm at (6,7), moving right would take me towards column 7, which has three apples. That might be a good strategy because I can potentially collect multiple apples if I move in that direction. Alternatively, moving left towards (0,6) would require me to go all the way to the left, which is a longer distance.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves from my current position. From (6,7), I can move up to (6,8), down to (6,6), left to (5,7), or right to (7,7). \n\nIf I move right to (7,7), I'm one step closer to the apple at (7,9). From there, I can move up twice to reach (7,9) and collect that apple. That seems doable. Alternatively, moving down to (6,6) might lead me towards the apple at (3,5), but that's a longer path.\n\nI should also check if moving right is safe. The enemy snake is at (1,9), so it's not blocking my path. Also, I need to make sure I don't run into myself. Since my body is only at (6,7) right now, moving right to (7,7) is safe as long as I don't reverse direction later.\n\nAnother consideration is the other apples. The apple at (7,5) is also on the right side, but it's lower down. If I go for (7,9) first, I can then move down to (7,5) if possible. The apple at (7,3) is even lower, so that would require more steps.\n\nI think the best immediate move is to go right towards (7,7). That way, I can start moving towards the apple at (7,9) without any obstacles. Plus, being on the right side might give me more options for future moves, especially if the enemy snake decides to come down.\n\nWait, but I should also check if moving right is the optimal path. Let me visualize the board. From (6,7), moving right to (7,7) is a safe move. From there, moving up to (7,8) and then to (7,9) would collect that apple. That's two moves ahead. Alternatively, if I move down first, I might miss the opportunity to collect the higher apple quickly.\n\nI think the key here is to maximize points by collecting as many apples as possible. Since the apples on the right are closer, it's better to go for them first. Plus, the enemy snake is not in the way, so I don't have to worry about it interfering immediately.\n\nSo, my plan is to move right to (7,7) next, then up to (7,8), and then up again to (7,9) to collect that apple. After that, I can move down to (7,5) and then further down to (7,3) if possible. This way, I can collect three apples on the right side without much backtracking.\n\nI should also make sure that moving right doesn't put me in a position where I can't move further because of walls or the enemy. Since the board is 10x10, moving right from (7,7) to (8,7) is still within bounds, and beyond that to (9,7). So, no immediate wall issues.\n\nIn terms of safety, I don't see any part of my body in that path, so I won't be running into myself. The enemy snake is far away, so unless it moves towards me, I should be fine.\n\nTherefore, the best next move is to go right to (7,7). This sets me up to collect the apple at (7,9) in two more moves, which is a good strategy for maximizing points.\n</think>\n\nThe next move is to move RIGHT to (7,7) to start collecting apples on the right side of the board.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** My snake is at (6,7).\n2. **Apple Locations:** Apples are at (0,6), (3,5), (7,3), (7,5), and (7,9).\n3. **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 is at (1,9), not blocking my path.\n4. **Possible Moves:** From (6,7), I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n5. **Safety Check:** Moving RIGHT to (7,7) is safe as there are no obstacles.\n6. **Strategic Advantage:** Moving towards the right allows me to collect multiple apples (7,9), (7,5), and (7,3) in subsequent moves.\n7. **Optimal Path:** Moving RIGHT sets me up to collect the highest apple first, then proceed down.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"

The apples at (7,3), (7,5), and (7,9) are all along the right side of the board, which is column 7. The apple at (3,5) is in the middle, and (0,6) is on the left side.\n\nSince I'm at (6,7), moving right would take me towards column 7, which has three apples. That might be a good strategy because I can potentially collect multiple apples if I move in that direction. Alternatively, moving left towards (0,6) would require me to go all the way to the left, which is a longer distance.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves from my current position. From (6,7), I can move up to (6,8), down to (6,6), left to (5,7), or right to (7,7). \n\nIf I move right to (7,7), I'm one step closer to the apple at (7,9). From there, I can move up twice to reach (7,9) and collect that apple. That seems doable. Alternatively, moving down to (6,6) might lead me towards the apple at (3,5), but that's a longer path.\n\nI should also check if moving right is safe. The enemy snake is at (1,9), so it's not blocking my path. Also, I need to make sure I don't run into myself. Since my body is only at (6,7) right now, moving right to (7,7) is safe as long as I don't reverse direction later.\n\nAnother consideration is the other apples. The apple at (7,5) is also on the right side, but it's lower down. If I go for (7,9) first, I can then move down to (7,5) if possible. The apple at (7,3) is even lower, so that would require more steps.\n\nI think the best immediate move is to go right towards (7,7). That way, I can start moving towards the apple at (7,9) without any obstacles. Plus, being on the right side might give me more options for future moves, especially if the enemy snake decides to come down.\n\nWait, but I should also check if moving right is the optimal path. Let me visualize the board. From (6,7), moving right to (7,7) is a safe move. From there, moving up to (7,8) and then to (7,9) would collect that apple. That's two moves ahead. Alternatively, if I move down first, I might miss the opportunity to collect the higher apple quickly.\n\nI think the key here is to maximize points by collecting as many apples as possible. Since the apples on the right are closer, it's better to go for them first. Plus, the enemy snake is not in the way, so I don't have to worry about it interfering immediately.\n\nSo, my plan is to move right to (7,7) next, then up to (7,8), and then up again to (7,9) to collect that apple. After that, I can move down to (7,5) and then further down to (7,3) if possible. This way, I can collect three apples on the right side without much backtracking.\n\nI should also make sure that moving right doesn't put me in a position where I can't move further because of walls or the enemy. Since the board is 10x10, moving right from (7,7) to (8,7) is still within bounds, and beyond that to (9,7). So, no immediate wall issues.\n\nIn terms of safety, I don't see any part of my body in that path, so I won't be running into myself. The enemy snake is far away, so unless it moves towards me, I should be fine.\n\nTherefore, the best next move is to go right to (7,7). This sets me up to collect the apple at (7,9) in two more moves, which is a good strategy for maximizing points.\n\n**Step-by-Step Explanation:**\n\n1. **Current Position:** My snake is at (6,7).\n2. **Apple Locations:** Apples are at (0,6), (3,5), (7,3), (7,5), and (7,9).\n3. **Enemy Position:** Snake #1 is at (1,9), not blocking my path.\n4. **Possible Moves:** From (6,7), I can move UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n5. **Safety Check:** Moving RIGHT to (7,7) is safe as there are no obstacles.\n6. **Strategic Advantage:** Moving towards the right allows me to collect multiple apples (7,9), (7,5), and (7,3) in subsequent moves.\n7. **Optimal Path:** Moving RIGHT sets me up to collect the highest apple first, then proceed down.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT\n\n--End of your last move information.--\n\nRules:\n1) If you move onto an apple, you grow and gain 1 point.\n2) If you run into a wall (outside the range of the listed coordinates), another snake, or yourself (like go backwards), you die.\n3) The goal is to have the most points by the end.\n\nDecreasing your x coordinate is to the left, increasing your x coordinate is to the right.\nDecreasing your y coordinate is down, increasing your y coordinate is up.\nYou may think out loud first then respond with the direction.\nYou may also state a strategy you want to tell yourself next turn.\nEnd your response with your decided next move: UP, DOWN, LEFT, or RIGHT.\n</think>\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT"

            "rationale": "<think>\nOkay, so I'm trying to figure out the best move for my snake in this game. Let me start by understanding the current board setup and the positions of everything.\n\nFirst, my snake is at (9,7), which is the top right area of the board. The apples are located at (0,6), (3,5), (7,3), (7,5), and (7,9). The enemy snake is at (0,7) with an empty body, so it's not a threat right now.\n\nLooking at the board, I can see that the apples are spread out, but there are a few clusters. The apple at (7,9) is right above my current position, which is (9,7). If I move up, I can reach that apple quickly. However, moving up from (9,7) would take me to (9,8), which is one step closer to (9,9), but there's no apple there. Alternatively, moving right from (9,7) would take me to (10,7), which is outside the board, so that's not possible. Wait, no, the board is 10x10, so the coordinates go from 0 to 9. So moving right from (9,7) would actually take me to (9,8), not (10,7). Hmm, I think I made a mistake there.\n\nWait, no, the x-coordinate increases to the right, so moving right from (9,7) would actually take me to (10,7), which is outside the board. So that's not allowed. So my options are to move up, down, or left.\n\nMoving up from (9,7) would take me to (9,8), which is safe and closer to the apple at (7,9). But I'm not sure if that's the best move. Alternatively, moving left from (9,7) would take me to (8,7), which is also a safe move but doesn't get me closer to any apples immediately.\n\nWait, the apple at (7,9) is two steps up from (9,7). So moving up twice would get me there. But I also have other apples to consider. The apple at (7,5) is another one that's on the right side, but it's further down. The apple at (3,5) is more to the left, and (0,6) is even further left.\n\nI think the key here is to prioritize the closest apples. The apple at (7,9) is the closest to me, so maybe I should aim for that first. But I also need to consider the path and whether moving up is the best direction without running into any walls or the enemy snake.\n\nLooking at the board again, the enemy snake is at (0,7), which is on the opposite side, so it's not blocking my path. The body of the enemy snake is empty, so it's not a threat right now.\n\nSo, considering all this, moving up from (9,7) to (9,8) seems like a safe and strategic move because it gets me closer to the apple at (7,9) without any immediate obstacles. Plus, it's a step towards a high-value apple that I can collect in the next move if possible.\n\nWait, but if I move up to (9,8), I'm still two steps away from (9,9), which is the top right corner. The apple at (7,9) is at (7,9), so I'm two steps to the left of that. So maybe moving up isn't the most efficient. Alternatively, if I move left twice, I can get to (7,7), which is directly below the apple at (7,9). That might be a better path because then I can move up two steps to reach the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (9,7) is safe. The cell at (8,7) is empty, and (7,7) is also empty, so that's a safe path. However, I have to consider the direction I'm moving. If I move left, I'm going towards the lower x-coordinate, which might take me away from other apples, but in this case, the apple at (7,9) is more valuable.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider the other apples. The apple at (7,5) is also on the right side but lower down. If I move left to (7,7), I can then move down to (7,5) in two steps, collecting two apples in the process. That seems efficient.\n\nBut I need to think about the immediate next move. My current position is (9,7). If I move left, I go to (8,7). From there, moving left again would take me to (7,7), which is directly below the apple at (7,9). Then, moving up twice would get me to (7,9). Alternatively, from (7,7), I could move down to (7,5) to collect that apple.\n\nSo, considering that, moving left from (9,7) to (8,7) is a good first step because it opens up the possibility of collecting multiple apples in the future. However, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't put me in a position where I can't reach the apples without backtracking.\n\nWait, but if I move left to (8,7), I'm still two steps away from (7,7), and then from there, I can decide whether to go up or down. It seems like a solid plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left twice to (7,8) and then up to (7,9). That also works, but it's two moves instead of one. So, moving left first might be more efficient in the long run.\n\nBut I also need to consider the enemy snake. If the enemy snake starts moving towards me, I need to make sure I have an escape route. However, since the enemy snake is at (0,7), it's on the opposite side, so it's not a threat right now.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the other apples. The apple at (3,5) is on the left side, and (0,6) is even further left. If I move left, I might be moving away from those, but since they are further away, it's better to focus on the closer apples first.\n\nSo, to summarize, my options are:\n\n1. Move up to (9,8), then left to (7,8), then up to (7,9) to collect the apple there.\n2. Move left to (8,7), then left to (7,7), then up to (7,9) or down to (7,5).\n\nBoth paths seem viable, but moving left first might allow me to collect more apples in the future without backtracking. However, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't put me in a position where I can't reach the apples without getting stuck.\n\nWait, but if I move left to (8,7), I can then move left again to (7,7), and from there, I can decide to go up or down. That seems like a good strategy because it gives me flexibility.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). But that's two moves, whereas moving left first would allow me to collect the apple at (7,9) in two moves as well.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look at the board again.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (7,9) is at the top middle-right, and the apple at (7,5) is at the bottom middle-right. So, if I move left to (7,7), I can then move up to (7,9) or down to (7,5). That gives me two options for collecting apples, which is good.\n\nOn the other hand, if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). But that's a longer path, and I might be missing out on the apple at (7,5).\n\nWait, but if I move left to (7,7), I can collect both apples at (7,9) and (7,5) in two moves each, which is efficient. So, moving left first seems better.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (9,7) is safe. The cell at (8,7) is empty, and (7,7) is also empty, so that's safe.\n\nSo, my next move should be to move left to (8,7). That way, I can then proceed towards either (7,9) or (7,5) depending on which is more advantageous.\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,9) is only two steps up from (7,7), while the apple at (7,5) is two steps down. So, if I move left to (7,7), I can choose to go up or down based on which apple is more valuable or which path is safer.\n\nBut in this case, both apples are worth the same, so it's a matter of which one I can reach first. Since I'm at (9,7), moving left to (8,7) and then to (7,7) is two moves, and then I can decide to go up or down.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up first to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). That's also three moves, but I might be able to collect the apple at (7,9) in the next move.\n\nWait, but if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). That's two moves from my current position. So, moving up first might allow me to collect the apple at (7,9) in two moves, whereas moving left first would take three moves.\n\nHmm, that's a good point. So, moving up first might be more efficient in terms of time to collect the apple at (7,9).\n\nBut I also have the apple at (7,5) to consider. If I move up to (9,8), then left to (7,8), and then down to (7,7), I can then move down to (7,5). That would take four moves, whereas if I move left first, I can collect both apples in fewer moves.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to outline the possible paths:\n\nOption 1: Move up to (9,8), then left to (7,8), then up to (7,9) to collect the apple there. That's three moves.\n\nOption 2: Move left to (8,7), then left to (7,7), then up to (7,9). That's also three moves.\n\nSo, both options take the same number of moves to collect the apple at (7,9). However, if I choose Option 2, I can then move down to (7,5) in one more move, collecting two apples in four moves. If I choose Option 1, I can collect the apple at (7,9) in three moves, and then I would need to move down to (7,5) in two more moves, totaling five moves.\n\nSo, Option 2 seems more efficient because I can collect both apples in four moves instead of five.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider the immediate next move. My current position is (9,7). If I move up to (9,8), that's safe. If I move left to (8,7), that's also safe.\n\nI think the key is to get closer to the apples as quickly as possible. Since both (7,9) and (7,5) are on the same x-coordinate, moving to (7,7) would allow me to access both apples with minimal movement.\n\nTherefore, moving left to (8,7) is the first step towards that goal. From there, I can move left again to (7,7), and then decide to go up or down based on which apple is more advantageous.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up first, I can reach (7,9) in three moves, but then I have to backtrack to reach (7,5), which might not be as efficient.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think moving left to (8,7) is the best immediate move because it sets me up for collecting both apples at (7,9) and (7,5) in the future without backtracking.\n\nWait, but I also have the apple at (3,5) and (0,6) to consider. Those are on the left side, but they are further away. It's better to collect the closer apples first before moving on to the farther ones.\n\nSo, focusing on (7,9) and (7,5) makes sense. Therefore, moving left to (8,7) is the optimal first step.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because moving up to (9,8) also seems like a good move towards (7,9). Maybe I should think about the direction that gets me closer to the most apples.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (7,9) is directly above (7,7), and the apple at (7,5) is directly below. So, being at (7,7) gives me access to both. Therefore, moving left to (8,7) is better because it's the first step towards (7,7), which is a strategic position.\n\nIn contrast, moving up to (9,8) only gets me closer to (7,9) but doesn't help me with (7,5). So, moving left seems more advantageous in the long run.\n\nAnother consideration is the enemy snake. If the enemy snake starts moving towards me, I need to have an escape route. But since the enemy snake is at (0,7), it's on the opposite side, so it's not a threat right now. Therefore, I don't need to worry about it for the immediate move.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't put me in a position where I can't move further left without hitting a wall or the enemy snake. Since (7,7) is within the board and there's no snake there, it's safe.\n\nSo, after considering all these factors, I think moving left to (8,7) is the best next move. It positions me strategically to collect multiple apples in the future without backtracking and avoids any immediate threats.\n</think>\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n\n**Strategy:** Moving left to (8,7) positions me strategically to collect multiple apples in the future, particularly those at (7,9) and (7,5), without backtracking. This move sets up a flexible path towards higher-value apples while avoiding immediate threats."

That seems like a good plan.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). But that's two moves, whereas moving left first would take three moves.\n\nHmm, I'm a bit confused. Maybe I should look at the board again.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (7,9) is at the top middle-right, and the apple at (7,5) is at the bottom middle-right. So, if I move left to (7,7), I can then move up to (7,9) or down to (7,5). That gives me two options for collecting apples, which is good.\n\nOn the other hand, if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). But that's a longer path, and I might be missing out on the apple at (7,5).\n\nWait, but if I move left to (7,7), I can collect both apples at (7,9) and (7,5) in two moves each, which is efficient. So, moving left first seems better.\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving left from (9,7) is safe. The cell at (8,7) is empty, and (7,7) is also empty, so that's safe.\n\nSo, my next move should be to move left to (8,7). That way, I can then proceed towards either (7,9) or (7,5) depending on which is more advantageous.\n\nWait, but the apple at (7,9) is only two steps up from (7,7), while the apple at (7,5) is two steps down. So, if I move left to (7,7), I can choose to go up or down based on which apple is more valuable or which path is safer.\n\nBut in this case, both apples are worth the same, so it's a matter of which one I can reach first. Since I'm at (9,7), moving left to (8,7) and then to (7,7) is two moves, and then I can decide to go up or down.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). That's also three moves, but I might be able to collect the apple at (7,9) in the next move.\n\nWait, but if I move up to (9,8), I can then move left to (7,8), and then up to (7,9). That's two moves from my current position. So, moving up first might be more efficient in terms of time to collect the apple at (7,9).\n\nBut I also have the apple at (7,5) to consider. If I move up to (9,8), then left to (7,8), and then down to (7,7), I can then move down to (7,5). That would take four moves, whereas if I move left first, I can collect both apples in fewer moves.\n\nWait, maybe I'm overcomplicating this. Let me try to outline the possible paths:\n\nOption 1: Move up to (9,8), then left to (7,8), then up to (7,9) to collect the apple there. That's three moves.\n\nOption 2: Move left to (8,7), then left to (7,7), then up to (7,9). That's also three moves.\n\nSo, both options take the same number of moves to collect the apple at (7,9). However, if I choose Option 2, I can then move down to (7,5) in one more move, collecting two apples in four moves. If I choose Option 1, I can collect the apple at (7,9) in three moves, and then I would need to move down to (7,5) in two more moves, totaling five moves.\n\nSo, Option 2 seems more efficient because I can collect both apples in four moves instead of five.\n\nBut wait, I need to consider the immediate next move. My current position is (9,7). If I move up to (9,8), that's safe. If I move left to (8,7), that's also safe.\n\nI think the key is to get closer to the apples as quickly as possible. Since both (7,9) and (7,5) are on the same x-coordinate, moving to (7,7) would allow me to access both apples with minimal movement.\n\nTherefore, moving left to (8,7) is the first step towards that goal. From there, I can move left again to (7,7), and then decide to go up or down based on which apple is more advantageous.\n\nAlternatively, if I move up first, I can reach (7,9) in three moves, but then I have to backtrack to reach (7,5), which might not be as efficient.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think moving left to (8,7) is the best immediate move because it sets me up for collecting both apples at (7,9) and (7,5) in the future without backtracking.\n\nWait, but I also have the apple at (3,5) and (0,6) to consider. Those are on the left side, but they are further away. It's better to collect the closer apples first before moving on to the farther ones.\n\nSo, focusing on (7,9) and (7,5) makes sense. Therefore, moving left to (8,7) is the optimal first step.\n\nBut I'm a bit unsure because moving up to (9,8) also seems like a good move towards (7,9). Maybe I should think about the direction that gets me closer to the most apples.\n\nLooking at the board, the apple at (7,9) is directly above (7,7), and the apple at (7,5) is directly below. So, being at (7,7) gives me access to both. Therefore, moving left to (8,7) is better because it's the first step towards (7,7), which is a strategic position.\n\nIn contrast, moving up to (9,8) only gets me closer to (7,9) but doesn't help me with (7,5). So, moving left seems more advantageous in the long run.\n\nAnother consideration is the enemy snake. If the enemy snake starts moving towards me, I need to have an escape route. But since the enemy snake is at (0,7), it's on the opposite side, so it's not a threat right now. Therefore, I don't need to worry about it for the immediate move.\n\nAlso, I need to make sure that moving left doesn't put me in a position where I can't move further left without hitting a wall or the enemy snake. Since (7,7) is within the board and there's no snake there, it's safe.\n\nSo, after considering all these factors, I think moving left to (8,7) is the best next move. It positions me strategically to collect multiple apples in the future without backtracking and avoids any immediate threats.\n\n**Next Move:** LEFT\n\n**Strategy:** Moving left to (8,7) positions me strategically to collect multiple apples in the future, particularly those at (7,9) and (7,5), without backtracking. This move sets up a flexible path towards higher-value apples while avoiding immediate threats."

Over-extension might require corrective turns that could hinder efficient apple collection.\n\n**Next Move:**\n- **Direction to Move**: RIGHT\n  - Moving RIGHT from (1, 6) will bring my snake to (2, 6).
