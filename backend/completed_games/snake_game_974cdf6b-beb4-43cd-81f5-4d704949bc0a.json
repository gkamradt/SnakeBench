This is advantageous as it leads to gaining a point and extending the length, which is crucial for survival and scoring.\n    \n3. **LEFT (to 0, 2):**\n   - Moves horizontally to the edge without apparent benefits. No apples are aligned in this direction.\n    \n4. **RIGHT (to 2, 2):**\n   - No direct benefit from this move as it heads away from the closest apple and doesn't help in scoring or strategic placement.\n\nConsidering the absolute proximity of apple at (1, 1) and the tactical advantage of growing by consuming apples, **moving DOWN to (1, 1)** is clearly the most direct and beneficial action. It helps in both scoring and extending the length of the snake.\n\n**Future Strategic Considerations:**\n- Post consuming the apple at (1, 1), the next closest target should be evaluated. If possible, making a move towards more centrally located apples (like those at (6, 7), (7, 7)) might be sensible, but careful attention to the movement of enemy snake #1 is crucial to avoid confrontation.\n- Remain vigilant of the surrounding area and continue to avoid obstacles and the enemy snake.\n\n**Decided next move: DOWN.**"

No apples are aligned in this direction.\n    \n4. **RIGHT (to 2, 2):**\n   - No direct benefit from this move as it heads away from the closest apple and doesn't help in scoring or strategic placement.\n\nConsidering the absolute proximity of apple at (1, 1) and the tactical advantage of growing by consuming apples, **moving DOWN to (1, 1)** is clearly the most direct and beneficial action. It helps in both scoring and extending the length of the snake.\n\n**Future Strategic Considerations:**\n- Post consuming the apple at (1, 1), the next closest target should be evaluated. If possible, making a move towards more centrally located apples (like those at (6, 7), (7, 7)) might be sensible, but careful attention to the movement of enemy snake #1 is crucial to avoid confrontation.\n- Remain vigilant of the surrounding area and continue to avoid obstacles and the enemy snake.\n\n**Decided next move: DOWN.**"

I'll maintain awareness and flexibility in my routes to avoid its path.\n\n### Upcoming Strategy:\n- After eating the apple at (5, 0), plan to either go towards (6, 3) with a combination of RIGHT then UP moves or explore the possibility of moving UP towards apples in row 7.\n- Ensuring ample \"space\" around me is critical in enabling flexibility against potential enemy movements.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** LEFT"

It might be viable if focusing on maximizing space and avoiding conflict.\n- **RIGHT** to (6, 7): This move would put us on the spot with an apple, which is an immediate benefit in points and growth. It also positions us right next to snake #1, a risky proximity if it moves up. Monitoring snake #1's actions becomes essential if we choose this move.\n- **LEFT** to (4, 7): It is a safer move in terms of distancing ourselves from the enemy snake, but it leads away from nearby apples and can potentially limit future strategic options.\n- **DOWN** to (5, 6): This option is backwards and not allowed, as retracing the last move can lead to an automatic death.\n\n**Strategic Considerations:**\n- **RIGHT** offers an immediate gain with the apple at (6, 7) and may allow subsequent access to the apple at (7, 7) or even the apple at (8, 4) if the path is open and safe in subsequent moves. \n- A key factor will be watching how snake #1 moves, especially if it decides to head up towards (6, 7), which would create a direct conflict.\n- Additionally, ensuring we don\u2019t get boxed into the upper right corner with the wall and other snakes or our own growing body will be crucial.\n\n**Next Turn Strategy:**\n- Execute the move to capture the apple at (6, 7) with a preparedness to shift direction based on enemy movement.\n- Focus on possibly curving towards the apple at (7, 7) next if the path remains clear and safe or reposition strategically if snake #1 moves to (6, 7).\n\n**Decided next move: RIGHT**, aiming for growth with the immediate apple capture while keeping an eye on the nearby enemy snake\u2019s movements."
