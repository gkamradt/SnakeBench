There are apples at (4,8), (7,6), (4,2), (2,5), and (6,7). Oh, and there's an enemy snake number 1 at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- Row 9: all dots, no snakes or apples.\n\n- Row 8: apple at (4,8).\n\n- Row 7: apple at (7,6).\n\n- Row 6: apple at (6,7).\n\n- Row 5: apple at (2,5).\n\n- Row 4: empty.\n\n- Row 3: empty.\n\n- Row 2: me at (2,2), apple at (4,2).\n\n- Row 1: enemy snake at (3,1).\n\n- Row 0: empty.\n\nSo, I'm at (2,2), and there's an apple at (4,2), which is directly to my right. There's another apple at (2,5), which is above me. The other apples are farther away.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake. It's at (3,1), which is below and to the right of me. Since it's only the head with no body parts, it's probably small.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The apple at (4,2) is closest, only two steps to the right. But if I go there, I need to make sure the enemy isn't going to block me or something.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is three steps up. That might be safer, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves:\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (4,2).\n\n- Move right twice.\n\n- But I need to check if the enemy might interfere.\n\n- The enemy is at (3,1), and if it moves up, it could be at (3,2), which is between me and the apple at (4,2).\n\n- If I move right to (3,2), and the enemy is also at (3,2), I'll collide and die.\n\n- So, that's risky.\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (2,5).\n\n- Move up three times.\n\n- The enemy is at (3,1), and if it moves up, it would be at (3,2), then (3,3), etc.\n\n- So, if I move up, and the enemy moves up, our paths don't cross immediately.\n\n- But I need to see if the enemy might cut me off.\n\nOption 3: Go for one of the farther apples, like (4,8) or (7,6).\n\n- That seems too far away, and I might get intercepted by the enemy or run into walls.\n\nSo, perhaps Option 2 is better: go for the apple at (2,5).\n\nLet me think about the path:\n\n- From (2,2) to (2,5): up three times.\n\n- Check for obstacles:\n\n- At (2,3): empty.\n\n- At (2,4): empty.\n\n- At (2,5): apple.\n\n- Seems safe.\n\n- After eating the apple at (2,5), I'll grow, so my tail will be at (2,2), then (2,3), and head at (2,5).\n\nThen, I can look for the next apple.\n\nLet me see the next apple to go for after (2,5). The closest one would be (4,8) or (7,6). Hmm.\n\nBut before that, I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy.\n\nWait, I should also consider that after I move, the enemy might move as well.\n\nI need to anticipate the enemy's moves.\n\nIf I move up to (2,3), and the enemy moves up to (3,2), then:\n\n- My tail is still at (2,2).\n\n- So, if the enemy moves to (3,2), it's still safe.\n\nThen, I move up to (2,4), and the enemy moves up to (3,3).\n\nStill safe.\n\nThen, move up to (2,5) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail extends, so it's now at (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), and head at (2,5).\n\nNow, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (4,8), (7,6), (6,7), and (4,2).\n\nThe apple at (4,2) is now at the same level as my position, but I need to go down to get it, which might be risky if the enemy is moving up.\n\nAlternatively, I can aim for (6,7), which is at (6,7), so I need to move right to (6,5), then up to (6,7).\n\nBut that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, (7,6) is at (7,6), so right to (7,5), then up to (7,6).\n\nThat might be a bit shorter.\n\nBut I need to make sure the enemy isn't moving towards those positions.\n\nWait, maybe I should just pick the closest apple, which is (4,2), but that seems risky due to the enemy's potential path.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for (6,7) or (7,6).\n\nLet me think about the path to (6,7):\n\n- From (2,5), right to (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), then up to (6,6), (6,7).\n\nThat's six moves.\n\nDuring that time, the enemy could potentially move up to (3,7) or something, possibly intercepting my path.\n\nSimilarly, going to (7,6):\n\n- From (2,5), right to (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), then up to (7,6).\n\nThat's seven moves.\n\nAgain, the enemy could be moving up and intercepting.\n\nThis seems too risky and time-consuming.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for the apple at (4,8).\n\n- From (2,5), right to (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), then up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), then left to (8,9), (7,9), etc.\n\nThat's way too far.\n\nThis isn't practical.\n\nI need a better strategy.\n\nPerhaps I should try to eat the apple at (4,2), but carefully.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n- From (2,2), right to (3,2).\n\n- Then up to (3,3).\n\n- Then right to (4,3).\n\n- Then up to (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8) to eat the apple at (4,8).\n\nWait, that's also far.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,2), up to (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) to eat the apple at (2,5), then right to (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6) to eat the apple at (7,6).\n\nThat seems a bit long, but maybe more manageable.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's movements.\n\nAssuming the enemy moves up each turn, starting from (3,1):\n\n- Turn 1: moves to (3,2).\n\n- Turn 2: moves to (3,3).\n\n- Turn 3: moves to (3,4).\n\n- Turn 4: moves to (3,5).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, if I move up to (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), then right to (3,5), (4,5), etc., the enemy will be at (3,5) when I reach there.\n\nSo, collision.\n\nThat's bad.\n\nI need to find a way to avoid that.\n\nMaybe I can adjust my path to go around the enemy.\n\nFor example, after eating the apple at (2,5), instead of going right to (3,5), go up to (2,6), then right to (3,6), (4,6), etc.\n\nLet me see:\n\n- After eating (2,5), move up to (2,6).\n\n- Then right to (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6) to eat the apple at (7,6).\n\n- During this time, the enemy is at (3,5), then (3,6), etc.\n\n- So, when I'm at (3,6), the enemy is also at (3,6).\n\n- Collision.\n\nStill a problem.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I need to find a different path.\n\nAlternatively, I"

I need to clarify that.\n\nLooking at the board state:\n\nRow 2: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nSo, position (4,2) has an apple, and my snake is at (2,2). So, yes, I'm at (2,2). Earlier, there was a mention of (3,2), but according to the board, it's (2,2). Maybe a typo.\n\nEnemy snake #1 is at (3,1) with no body parts, so it's just the head.\n\nOkay, so my position is (2,2), and I need to decide whether to go for the apple at (4,2) or the one at (2,5).\n\nFrom my last move information, I was considering going up to (2,5) to avoid potential conflicts with the enemy snake. That seems like a reasonable approach.\n\nBut let's think this through again.\n\nIf I go for the apple at (4,2), which is to the right, I need to move right twice to reach (4,2). However, the enemy is at (3,1), and if it moves up, it could be at (3,2), which is on my path to the apple at (4,2).

During that time, the enemy would be moving up as well, assuming it's trying to grow or reach apples.\n\nIf the enemy moves up to (3,2), then (3,3), then (3,4), and so on, our paths don't directly cross.

It's closer, and it allows me to gain some ground without directly conflicting with the enemy's potential path.\n\nOnce I have more points and a longer body, I might have more options to maneuver around the enemy.\n\nSo, my plan is to move up to (2,3), then (2,4), and finally (2,5) to eat the apple there.\n\nThen, I can assess the situation again and decide which apple to go for next.\n\nFor now, I'll proceed with moving up.\n\n**Next Move: UP**"

There are apples at (4,8), (7,6), (4,2), (2,5), and (6,7). Oh, and there's an enemy snake number 1 at (3,1) with no body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\n- Row 9: all dots, no snakes or apples.\n\n- Row 8: apple at (4,8).\n\n- Row 7: apple at (7,6).\n\n- Row 6: apple at (6,7).\n\n- Row 5: apple at (2,5).\n\n- Row 4: empty.\n\n- Row 3: empty.\n\n- Row 2: me at (2,2), apple at (4,2).\n\n- Row 1: enemy snake at (3,1).\n\n- Row 0: empty.\n\nSo, I'm at (2,2), and there's an apple at (4,2), which is directly to my right. There's another apple at (2,5), which is above me. The other apples are farther away.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake. It's at (3,1), which is below and to the right of me. Since it's only the head with no body parts, it's probably small.\n\nI need to think about which apple to go for first. The apple at (4,2) is closest, only two steps to the right. But if I go there, I need to make sure the enemy isn't going to block me or something.\n\nAlternatively, the apple at (2,5) is three steps up. That might be safer, but I'm not sure.\n\nLet me consider the possible moves:\n\nOption 1: Go for the apple at (4,2).\n\n- Move right twice.\n\n- But I need to check if the enemy might interfere.\n\n- The enemy is at (3,1), and if it moves up, it could be at (3,2), which is between me and the apple at (4,2).\n\n- If I move right to (3,2), and the enemy is also at (3,2), I'll collide and die.\n\n- So, that's risky.\n\nOption 2: Go for the apple at (2,5).\n\n- Move up three times.\n\n- The enemy is at (3,1), and if it moves up, it would be at (3,2), then (3,3), etc.\n\n- So, if I move up, and the enemy moves up, our paths don't cross immediately.\n\n- But I need to see if the enemy might cut me off.\n\nOption 3: Go for one of the farther apples, like (4,8) or (7,6).\n\n- That seems too far away, and I might get intercepted by the enemy or run into walls.\n\nSo, perhaps Option 2 is better: go for the apple at (2,5).\n\nLet me think about the path:\n\n- From (2,2) to (2,5): up three times.\n\n- Check for obstacles:\n\n- At (2,3): empty.\n\n- At (2,4): empty.\n\n- At (2,5): apple.\n\n- Seems safe.\n\n- After eating the apple at (2,5), I'll grow, so my tail will be at (2,2), then (2,3), and head at (2,5).\n\nThen, I can look for the next apple.\n\nLet me see the next apple to go for after (2,5). The closest one would be (4,8) or (7,6). Hmm.\n\nBut before that, I need to make sure I don't run into the enemy.\n\nWait, I should also consider that after I move, the enemy might move as well.\n\nI need to anticipate the enemy's moves.\n\nIf I move up to (2,3), and the enemy moves up to (3,2), then:\n\n- My tail is still at (2,2).\n\n- So, if the enemy moves to (3,2), it's still safe.\n\nThen, I move up to (2,4), and the enemy moves up to (3,3).\n\nStill safe.\n\nThen, move up to (2,5) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, my tail extends, so it's now at (2,2), (2,3), (2,4), and head at (2,5).\n\nNow, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples: (4,8), (7,6), (6,7), and (4,2).\n\nThe apple at (4,2) is now at the same level as my position, but I need to go down to get it, which might be risky if the enemy is moving up.\n\nAlternatively, I can aim for (6,7), which is at (6,7), so I need to move right to (6,5), then up to (6,7).\n\nBut that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, (7,6) is at (7,6), so right to (7,5), then up to (7,6).\n\nThat might be a bit shorter.\n\nBut I need to make sure the enemy isn't moving towards those positions.\n\nWait, maybe I should just pick the closest apple, which is (4,2), but that seems risky due to the enemy's potential path.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to go for (6,7) or (7,6).\n\nLet me think about the path to (6,7):\n\n- From (2,5), right to (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), then up to (6,6), (6,7).\n\nThat's six moves.\n\nDuring that time, the enemy could potentially move up to (3,7) or something, possibly intercepting my path.\n\nSimilarly, going to (7,6):\n\n- From (2,5), right to (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), then up to (7,6).\n\nThat's seven moves.\n\nAgain, the enemy could be moving up and intercepting.\n\nThis seems too risky and time-consuming.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for the apple at (4,8).\n\n- From (2,5), right to (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (8,5), (9,5), then up to (9,6), (9,7), (9,8), (9,9), then left to (8,9), (7,9), etc.\n\nThat's way too far.\n\nThis isn't practical.\n\nI need a better strategy.\n\nPerhaps I should try to eat the apple at (4,2), but carefully.\n\nLet me think about the steps:\n\n- From (2,2), right to (3,2).\n\n- Then up to (3,3).\n\n- Then right to (4,3).\n\n- Then up to (4,4), (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8) to eat the apple at (4,8).\n\nWait, that's also far.\n\nAlternatively, from (2,2), up to (2,3), (2,4), (2,5) to eat the apple at (2,5), then right to (3,5), (4,5), (5,5), (6,5), (7,5), (7,6) to eat the apple at (7,6).\n\nThat seems a bit long, but maybe more manageable.\n\nBut I need to consider the enemy's movements.\n\nAssuming the enemy moves up each turn, starting from (3,1):\n\n- Turn 1: moves to (3,2).\n\n- Turn 2: moves to (3,3).\n\n- Turn 3: moves to (3,4).\n\n- Turn 4: moves to (3,5).\n\nAnd so on.\n\nSo, if I move up to (2,3), (2,4), (2,5), then right to (3,5), (4,5), etc., the enemy will be at (3,5) when I reach there.\n\nSo, collision.\n\nThat's bad.\n\nI need to find a way to avoid that.\n\nMaybe I can adjust my path to go around the enemy.\n\nFor example, after eating the apple at (2,5), instead of going right to (3,5), go up to (2,6), then right to (3,6), (4,6), etc.\n\nLet me see:\n\n- After eating (2,5), move up to (2,6).\n\n- Then right to (3,6), (4,6), (5,6), (6,6), (7,6) to eat the apple at (7,6).\n\n- During this time, the enemy is at (3,5), then (3,6), etc.\n\n- So, when I'm at (3,6), the enemy is also at (3,6).\n\n- Collision.\n\nStill a problem.\n\nHmm.\n\nMaybe I need to find a different path.\n\nAlternatively, I"

Wait, the apple is at (2,5), so to get there from (3,3), I need to move up to (3,4), then left to (2,4), then up to (2,5).\n\nThat's a bit more steps than I thought.\n\nAlternatively, from (3,3), I can move left to (2,3), then up to (2,4), then up to (2,5).\n\nThat's three moves: left, up, up.\n\nMeanwhile, the enemy is at (3,1). If it moves up to (3,2), then (3,3), then (3,4), etc., I need to make sure not to collide with it.\n\nIf I move left to (2,3), and the enemy is at (3,3), we are on different cells.\n\nThen, I can move up to (2,4), and the enemy is at (3,4), so still not colliding.\n\nThen, eat the apple at (2,5).\n\nSo, that seems feasible.\n\nAfter eating (2,5), I can consider going for (4,8) or (7,6).\n\nLet's see the path to (4,8) from (2,5):\n\nMove down to (2,4), then right to (3,4), then right to (4,4), then up to (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8).\n\nThat's quite a few moves, and the enemy might be in the way.\n\nAlternatively, go for (7,6):\n\nFrom (2,5), move down to (2,4), then right to (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), (7,4), then up to (7,5), (7,6).\n\nThat's also quite a few moves.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for the closer apple first.\n\nWait, there's another apple at (6,7). That might be a better target after (2,5).\n\nFrom (2,5), move down to (2,4), right to (3,4), (4,4), (5,4), (6,4), then up to (6,5), (6,6), (6,7).\n\nStill quite a journey.\n\nAlternatively, go for (4,8):\n\nFrom (2,5), down to (2,4), right to (3,4), (4,4), then up to (4,5), (4,6), (4,7), (4,8).\n\nThat's 7 moves, assuming no collisions.\n\nI need to see if there's a better strategy.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for the apple at (4,2) first, since it's closer, and then go for (2,5) or another one.\n\nFrom (3,3), moving right to (4,3), then down to (4,2) to eat the apple.\n\nBut wait, I need to make sure that the enemy isn't blocking that path.\n\nThe enemy is at (3,"
