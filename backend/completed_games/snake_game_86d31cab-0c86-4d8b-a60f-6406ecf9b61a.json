Securing it is crucial before considering the next strategic point.\n- Post capturing the apple at (2, 8), I should reconsider the board, potentially plotting a route towards the next nearest apple at (3, 6).\n- It's vital to stay alert to the enemy snake's potential move, although currently, it poses no direct threat unless it moves down or right unexpectedly, the latter potentially blocking my path directly.\n\nFuture Planning:\n- Upon securing the apple at (2, 8), reassess the positions considering enemy's moves and decide the next closest apple.\n- Maintain essential space for mobility, avoiding traps created by the enemy snake or self-blocking.\n\nDecided Next Move: **UP** (Moving to position (2, 8), to capture the apple directly)."
