This gives me a point and makes my snake longer. \n\nThe enemy snake has moved to (4, 4), which doesn't directly threaten me but does limit my options a bit. If I try to go for the apple at (1, 6) now, there's a risk the enemy could move to cut me off.\n\nThe apple at (7, 8) is still a viable target, but it will take several moves to reach it safely. I'll need to go right and then up, being mindful not to hit my own growing tail.\n\nThere's also an apple at (8, 3) that could be reachable if I go down and then right. This might be the safest option for now, giving me some space to maneuver.\n\nI don't want to go left toward (1, 6) anymore, as that feels too risky with the enemy's position. \n\nStrategy for next turn:\nMove down to (3, 4). This keeps me safe from the enemy and my own tail, and sets me up to go right toward the apple at (8, 3) if it remains safe to do so. Keep an eye on the enemy's movements and be ready to adjust course if needed.\n\nMy long-term goal is still to collect apples efficiently and outscore the opponent, but I need to balance that with short-term safety and not boxing myself in. Take it one move at a time and always leave myself an escape route.\n\nMy next move: DOWN"
