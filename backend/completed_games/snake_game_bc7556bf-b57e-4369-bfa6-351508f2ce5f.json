Looking at the adjacent cells from our head at (6,2):\n\n\u2022 UP: (6,3) \u2013 occupied by our own body.\n\u2022 LEFT: (5,2) \u2013 occupied by our own body.\n\u2022 RIGHT: (7,2) \u2013 free.\n\u2022 DOWN: (6,1) \u2013 free.\n\nSince going UP or LEFT will immediately collide, our safe moves are RIGHT and DOWN.\n\nNow, surveying the apple positions:\n\u2003\u25cb (2,5)\n\u2003\u25cb (3,0)\n\u2003\u25cb (3,9)\n\u2003\u25cb (4,8)\n\u2003\u25cb (7,9)\n\nCalculating Manhattan distances from our head (6,2):\n\u2003\u2013 To (7,9): |7\u20136| + |9\u20132| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\u2003\u2013 To (3,0): |3\u20136| + |0\u20132| = 3 + 2 = 5\n\u2003\u2013 Other apples are farther.\n\nThe closest apple is (3,0), and it lies down and to the left of our head. Although we cannot immediately go left (that cell is occupied by our body), we see that moving DOWN to (6,1) sets us on a course from which we can start moving left in future turns. In contrast, moving RIGHT takes us further away from (3,0) and would likely require extra maneuvering to loop around our body, increasing the risk as our turn choices get more limited.\n\nAdditionally, the enemy snake (#1) is far off at (1,6) with its body confined to the left side of the board, so immediate danger isn\u2019t a concern there.\n\nGiven the safe options and our goal of reaching the nearest apple (3,0) with minimal risk, it makes sense to choose the move that begins our path downward and eventually leftward.\n\nTherefore, my decided next move is DOWN."
