            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 board. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (5,4). There are apples at (3,2), (8,3), (0,7), (0,3), and (1,9). Also, there's an enemy snake, number 1, at (2,4), and it doesn't have any body parts listed, which probably means it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . 1 . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . . A .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, my snake is at (5,4), which is in row 4, column 5. Enemy snake 1 is at (2,4), same row, column 2.\n\nNow, I need to think about how to approach this. The goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, there are multiple apples on the board, and I can eat them to grow and score points.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. I need to prioritize which apple to go for first.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (3,2): That's row 2, column 3.\n\n- (8,3): Row 3, column 8.\n\n- (0,7): Row 7, column 0.\n\n- (0,3): Row 3, column 0.\n\n- (1,9): Row 9, column 1.\n\nI'm at (5,4), so let's calculate the distances to each apple.\n\nDistance to (3,2):\n\nDelta X: |5-3| = 2\n\nDelta Y: |4-2| = 2\n\nTotal steps: 4\n\nDistance to (8,3):\n\nDelta X: |5-8| = 3\n\nDelta Y: |4-3| = 1\n\nTotal steps: 4\n\nDistance to (0,7):\n\nDelta X: |5-0| = 5\n\nDelta Y: |4-7| = 3\n\nTotal steps: 8\n\nDistance to (0,3):\n\nDelta X: |5-0| = 5\n\nDelta Y: |4-3| = 1\n\nTotal steps: 6\n\nDistance to (1,9):\n\nDelta X: |5-1| = 4\n\nDelta Y: |4-9| = 5\n\nTotal steps: 9\n\nSo, the closest apples are (3,2) and (8,3), both with 4 steps.\n\nBut I need to consider the paths and whether there are any obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's consider going to (3,2):\n\nFrom (5,4), I need to move left 2 steps and down 2 steps.\n\nSo, possible path:\n\n- Left to (4,4)\n\n- Left to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\nBut wait, there's an apple at (3,2), but also, there's another apple at (1,9), but that's far away.\n\nI need to see if there are any snakes in the way.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,4), which is on my path.\n\nWait, if I go left to (4,4), then left to (3,4), down to (3,3), down to (3,2).\n\nAt (3,4), is there any snake there? Enemy snake is at (2,4), so it's in column 2, row 4.\n\nSo, my path doesn't cross the enemy snake directly.\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy snake might move.\n\nAssuming the enemy snake doesn't move, I can safely go to (3,2).\n\nBut in reality, snakes can move, so I need to anticipate their possible moves.\n\nBut for simplicity, let's assume their positions are fixed for now.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider going to (8,3), which is also 4 steps away.\n\nFrom (5,4):\n\n- Right to (6,4)\n\n- Right to (7,4)\n\n- Right to (8,4)\n\n- Down to (8,3)\n\nThis seems straightforward.\n\nBut I need to check if there are any snakes in the way.\n\nEnemy snake is at (2,4), which is not on this path.\n\nSo, both paths seem clear.\n\nBut I need to think about which apple to go for first.\n\nIf I go for (3,2), I eat that apple, grow, and then decide where to go next.\n\nSimilarly, if I go for (8,3), I eat that apple, grow, and then decide where to go next.\n\nI need to consider which path might lead me closer to more apples.\n\nLooking at the board, after eating (3,2), I could potentially go to (1,9), but that's far.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,3), I could go to (8,3) and then maybe to (0,7) or (0,3), but that's also a bit far.\n\nWait, (0,7) is at row 7, column 0, which is up and to the left.\n\nFrom (3,2), I could go up to (3,3), then (3,4), (3,5), etc., towards (0,7).\n\nFrom (8,3), I could go up or down.\n\nHmm.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (0,3), which is directly left from (3,3).\n\nWait, if I go to (3,2), then to (3,3), and then left to (2,3), (1,3), (0,3) to eat the apple at (0,3).\n\nThat seems like a possible path.\n\nAfter that, I could go up to (0,7), but that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, from (8,3), I could go up to (8,4), (8,5), etc., but there are no apples in that direction.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (0,7), which is up and left.\n\nFrom (8,3), going left to (7,3), (6,3), etc., to (0,3), then up to (0,7).\n\nThat might be a longer path.\n\nSo, perhaps going to (3,2) first is better.\n\nAlso, I need to consider the enemy snake.\n\nIf I go to (3,2), I need to make sure the enemy snake isn't going to block my path.\n\nBut for now, let's assume it's stationary.\n\nAnother consideration is that the enemy snake might be trying to get to the same apple.\n\nBut since I don't have information about its movement, I'll proceed as if it's stationary.\n\nSo, let's plan to go to (3,2).\n\nFirst step would be to move left to (4,4).\n\nThen left to (3,4), down to (3,3), down to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to decide what direction to move in this turn.\n\nGiven that, I need to move left towards (4,4).\n\nWait, but I need to consider that moving left from (5,4) to (4,4) is a valid move.\n\nI need to make sure that I'm not going to collide with myself or the enemy snake.\n\nSince my snake is just the head at (5,4), and the enemy snake is at (2,4), which is three columns away, I should be safe.\n\nSo, my first move should be left, towards (4,4).\n\nThen, next turn, left again to (3,4), then down to (3,3), down to (3,2).\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy snake isn't going to move into my path.\n\nAssuming it stays put, this should be fine.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go for (8,3) instead.\n\nFrom (5,4), right to (6,4), right to (7,4), right to (8,4), down to (8,3).\n\nThat seems like a safe path as well.\n\nBut considering the positions of the apples, going to (3,2) might be better because there's another apple at (0,3) which is closer in that direction.\n\nWhereas going to (8,3) doesn't seem to set me up well for the next apple.\n\nAlso, there's an apple at (1,9), which is up and to the left, but that's pretty far.\n\nSo, perhaps going to (3,2)"

There are apples at (3,2), (8,3), (0,7), (0,3), and (1,9). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (2,3).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . 1 . . 2 . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . .

The enemy snake 1 is at (2,3), which is in row 3, column 2.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, there are multiple apples on the board, and I can eat them to grow and score points.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. I need to prioritize which apple to go for first.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (3,2): Row 2, column 3.\n\n- (8,3): Row 3, column 8.\n\n- (0,7): Row 7, column 0.\n\n- (0,3): Row 3, column 0.\n\n- (1,9): Row 9, column 1.\n\nI'm at (4,4), so let's calculate the distances to each apple.\n\nDistance to (3,2):\n\nDelta X: |4-3| = 1\n\nDelta Y: |4-2| = 2\n\nTotal steps: 3\n\nDistance to (8,3):\n\nDelta X: |4-8| = 4\n\nDelta Y: |4-3| = 1\n\nTotal steps: 5\n\nDistance to (0,7):\n\nDelta X: |4-0| = 4\n\nDelta Y: |4-7| = 3\n\nTotal steps: 7\n\nDistance to (0,3):\n\nDelta X: |4-0| = 4\n\nDelta Y: |4-3| = 1\n\nTotal steps: 5\n\nDistance to (1,9):\n\nDelta X: |4-1| = 3\n\nDelta Y: |4-9| = 5\n\nTotal steps: 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is (3,2) with 3 steps.\n\nBut I need to consider the paths and whether there are any obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's consider going to (3,2):\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move left to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then down to (3,2).\n\nAlternatively, I could move down to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then down to (3,2).\n\nI need to see if there are any snakes in the way.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,3), which is not on my direct path in either of these routes.\n\nSo, both paths seem clear.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider going to (8,3), which is farther away but might set me up for other apples.\n\nBut considering the distance, (3,2) is closer, so maybe I should go for that first.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I can look for the next apple.\n\nLooking at the board, after eating (3,2), I could potentially go to (0,3), which is left from (3,3), but that would require moving left to (2,3), (1,3), then (0,3).\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy snake is at (2,3), so I have to consider if it's going to move.\n\nAssuming it stays put, I could go to (0,3) after eating (3,2).\n\nThen, from (0,3), I could go up to (0,7), but that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (1,9), which is up and to the right, but that's even farther.\n\nSo, perhaps focusing on the apples in the lower part of the board first.\n\nAnother consideration is that while I'm going for (3,2), the enemy snake might try to intercept me.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume it stays put.\n\nSo, my immediate plan is to go to (3,2).\n\nTo do that, I can move left to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then down to (3,2).\n\nGiven that, my first move should be left to (3,4).\n\nBut wait, I'm at (4,4). Moving left to (3,4).\n\nI need to make sure that I'm not going to collide with the enemy snake or myself.\n\nSince I'm just the head at (4,4), and the enemy is at (2,3), which is not on my path to (3,4), it should be safe.\n\nSo, my first move is left to (3,4).\n\nThen, next move down to (3,3), then down to (3,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,2), I can consider my next move.\n\nPossible next targets could be (0,3) or (8,3).\n\nGiven that (0,3) is closer, I might go for that next.\n\nFrom (3,2), I would need to move up to (3,3), then left to (2,3), then left to (1,3), then left to (0,3).\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy snake is at (2,3), so I have to see if it's going to move.\n\nAssuming it stays put, I can go to (2,3), but it's better to avoid it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go directly to (0,3) without going through (2,3).\n\nBut to get from (3,2) to (0,3), I would need to move up to (3,3), then left to (2,3), which is where the enemy is.\n\nHmm, that could be problematic.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (8,3) after (3,2).\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move right to (4,2), then up to (4,3), then right to (5,3), and so on to (8,3).\n\nThat seems like a longer path, but avoids the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (1,9), which is up and to the right.\n\nBut that's quite far away.\n\nConsidering all this, perhaps going for (3,2) and then (8,3) is a better strategy.\n\nSo, for now, I'll proceed with moving left to (3,4).\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nLEFT"

Moving left to (3,4).\n\nI need to make sure that I'm not going to collide with the enemy snake or myself.\n\nSince I'm just the head at (4,4), and the enemy is at (2,3), which is not on my path to (3,4), it should be safe.\n\nSo, my first move is left to (3,4).\n\nThen, next move down to (3,3), then down to (3,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (3,2), I can consider my next move.\n\nPossible next targets could be (0,3) or (8,3).\n\nGiven that (0,3) is closer, I might go for that next.\n\nFrom (3,2), I would need to move up to (3,3), then left to (2,3), then left to (1,3), then left to (0,3).\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy snake is at (2,3), so I have to see if it's going to move.\n\nAssuming it stays put, I can go to (2,3), but it's better to avoid it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I can go directly to (0,3) without going through (2,3).\n\nBut to get from (3,2) to (0,3), I would need to move up to (3,3), then left to (2,3), which is where the enemy is.\n\nHmm, that could be problematic.\n\nMaybe I should consider going for (8,3) after (3,2).\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move right to (4,2), then up to (4,3), then right to (5,3), and so on to (8,3).\n\nThat seems like a longer path, but avoids the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, there's an apple at (1,9), which is up and to the right.\n\nBut that's quite far away.\n\nConsidering all this, perhaps going for (3,2) and then (8,3) is a better strategy.\n\nSo, for now, I'll proceed with moving left to (3,4).\n\n**Final Decision**\n\nLEFT"

There are apples at (3,2), (8,3), (0,7), (0,3), and (1,9). There's also an enemy snake, number 1, at (2,2).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . . A . . . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 7: A . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . 2 . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: A . . . . . . .

The enemy snake 1 is at (2,2), which is in row 2, column 2.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, there are multiple apples on the board, and I can eat them to grow and score points.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. I need to prioritize which apple to go for first.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (3,2): Row 2, column 3.\n\n- (8,3): Row 3, column 8.\n\n- (0,7): Row 7, column 0.\n\n- (0,3): Row 3, column 0.\n\n- (1,9): Row 9, column 1.\n\nI'm at (3,4), so let's calculate the distances to each apple.\n\nDistance to (3,2):\n\nDelta X: |3-3| = 0\n\nDelta Y: |4-2| = 2\n\nTotal steps: 2\n\nDistance to (8,3):\n\nDelta X: |3-8| = 5\n\nDelta Y: |4-3| = 1\n\nTotal steps: 6\n\nDistance to (0,7):\n\nDelta X: |3-0| = 3\n\nDelta Y: |4-7| = 3\n\nTotal steps: 6\n\nDistance to (0,3):\n\nDelta X: |3-0| = 3\n\nDelta Y: |4-3| = 1\n\nTotal steps: 4\n\nDistance to (1,9):\n\nDelta X: |3-1| = 2\n\nDelta Y: |4-9| = 5\n\nTotal steps: 7\n\nSo, the closest apple is (3,2) with 2 steps.\n\nBut I need to consider the paths and whether there are any obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's consider going to (3,2):\n\nFrom (3,4), I can move down to (3,3), then down to (3,2).\n\nAlternatively, I could move left to (2,4), then down to (2,3), then down to (2,2), but that's farther and the enemy is at (2,2).\n\nSo, the direct path seems better.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,2), which is not on my direct path to (3,2), so it should be safe.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I can look for the next apple.\n\nLooking at the board, after eating (3,2), I could potentially go to (0,3), which is left from (3,2).\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move left to (2,2), but that's where the enemy is. So, that might not be safe.\n\nAlternatively, I can aim for (8,3), which is to the right.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move right to (4,2), then up to (4,3), then continue right to (5,3), and so on to (8,3).\n\nThat seems like a longer path, but avoids the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider going for (0,7), which is up and to the left.\n\nFrom (3,2), I can move up to (3,3), then left to (2,3), then left to (1,3), then up to (1,4), and continue up to (1,7), then left to (0,7).\n\nThat's quite a circuitous route.\n\nGiven that, perhaps going for (8,3) after (3,2) is a better idea.\n\nSo, my plan is:\n\n1. Go to (3,2).\n\n2. Then go to (8,3).\n\n3. From there, decide on the next apple.\n\nFirst, to go to (3,2) from (3,4), I need to move down to (3,3), then down to (3,2).\n\nSo, my first move should be DOWN to (3,3).\n\nBut wait, in the previous turn, I moved LEFT to (3,4). If I move DOWN to (3,3), I need to make sure that my body doesn't get in the way.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, the body moves in the direction you choose, and the tail follows.\n\nBut in this game, since it's a multi-apple snake game, I need to consider that eating apples makes me grow.\n\nAssuming that when I eat an apple, my tail extends, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut for now, since I just started and haven't eaten any apples yet, my body is just the head at (3,4).\n\nWait, actually, in the board state, it shows my snake at (4,4), but in the text, it says (3,4). There might be a confusion here.\n\nLooking back, in the board state, row 4 has \". . . 2 . . . . . .\", which corresponds to column 3.\n\nSo, my snake is at (3,4).\n\nWait, but in the board, rows are numbered from 0 to 9, with 0 at the bottom.\n\nIn the board state provided, my snake is at (3,4), which is row 4, column 3.\n\nBut in the initial position, it says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (3, 4)\", which matches the board.\n\nOkay, so I'm at (3,4).\n\nNow, to move to (3,3), I need to move down.\n\nWait, no. Coordinates are (column, row), so (3,4) is column 3, row 4.\n\nTo move to (3,3), that's moving down, since lower row numbers are down.\n\nWait, in the board, higher Y values are upwards, so row 4 is higher than row 3.\n\nWait, in the board, row 9 is top, row 0 is bottom.\n\nSo, moving from row 4 to row 3 is moving up.\n\nI think there's confusion in coordinate notation.\n\nLet me clarify: in the board, rows are numbered from 0 to 9, with 0 at the bottom and 9 at the top.\n\nColumns are numbered from 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nSo, position (x,y) is column x, row y.\n\nTherefore, (3,4) is column 3, row 4.\n\nMoving to (3,3) would be moving up one row.\n\nGot it.\n\nSo, to go from (3,4) to (3,3), I need to move UP.\n\nSimilarly, to go from (3,3) to (3,2), I need to move UP again.\n\nSo, to reach (3,2), I need to move UP twice from (3,4).\n\nAlternatively, I could move LEFT to (2,4), but that would take me further from the apple.\n\nWait, no, moving LEFT from (3,4) to (2,4), then UP to (2,3), then UP to (2,2), which is where the enemy is.\n\nThat's not ideal.\n\nSo, moving UP twice to (3,2) seems the best.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy doesn't interfere.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,2), which is not on my path to (3,2), so it should be safe.\n\nTherefore, my first move should be UP to (3,3).\n\nThen, next move UP to (3,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,3)\n\n- (0,7)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,9)\n\nFrom (3,2), the closest apple is (8,3), which is 5 steps to the right and up.\n\nAlternatively, (0,3) is 3 steps left and down.\n\nBut ("

The coordinates range from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y values are upwards, and higher X values are to the right.\n\nLet me visualize the board:\n\nRow 9: . .

The enemy snake 1 is at (2,3), which is in row 3, column 2.\n\nMy goal is to collect as many apples as possible without dying. Dying happens if I hit a wall, another snake, or myself.\n\nSince this is a multi-apple snake game, there are multiple apples on the board, and I can eat them to grow and score points.\n\nFirst, I should consider the positions of the apples and plan a path to get to them. I need to prioritize which apple to go for first.\n\nLooking at the apple positions:\n\n- (3,2): Row 2, column 3.\n\n- (8,3): Row 3, column 8.\n\n- (0,7): Row 7, column 0.\n\n- (0,3): Row 3, column 0.\n\n- (1,9): Row 9, column 1.\n\nI'm at (4,4), so let's calculate the distances to each apple.\n\nDistance to (3,2):\n\nDelta X: |4-3| = 1\n\nDelta Y: |4-2| = 2\n\nTotal steps: 3\n\nDistance to (8,3):\n\nDelta X: |4-8| = 4\n\nDelta Y: |4-3| = 1\n\nTotal steps: 5\n\nDistance to (0,7):\n\nDelta X: |4-0| = 4\n\nDelta Y: |4-7| = 3\n\nTotal steps: 7\n\nDistance to (0,3):\n\nDelta X: |4-0| = 4\n\nDelta Y: |4-3| = 1\n\nTotal steps: 5\n\nDistance to (1,9):\n\nDelta X: |4-1| = 3\n\nDelta Y: |4-9| = 5\n\nTotal steps: 8\n\nSo, the closest apple is (3,2) with 3 steps.\n\nBut I need to consider the paths and whether there are any obstacles.\n\nFirst, let's consider going to (3,2):\n\nFrom (4,4), I can move left to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then down to (3,2).\n\nAlternatively, I could move down to (4,3), then left to (3,3), then down to (3,2).\n\nI need to see if there are any snakes in the way.\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (2,3), which is not on my direct path in either of these routes.\n\nSo, both paths seem clear.\n\nAlternatively, I can consider going to (8,3), which is farther away but might set me up for other apples.\n\nBut considering the distance, (3,2) is closer, so maybe I should go for that first.\n\nAfter eating (3,2), I can look for the next apple.\n\nLooking at the board, after eating (3,2), I could potentially go to (0,3), which is left from (3,3), but that would require moving left to (2,3), (1,3), then (0,3).\n\nBut I need to be careful because the enemy snake is at (2,3), so I have to consider if it's going to move.\n\nAssuming it stays put, I could go to (0,3) after eating (3,2).\n\nThen, from (0,3), I could go up to (0,7), but that's a bit far.\n\nAlternatively, I could aim for (1,9), which is up and to the right, but that's even farther.\n\nSo, perhaps focusing on the apples in the lower part of the board first.\n\nAnother consideration is that while I'm going for (3,2), the enemy snake might try to intercept me.\n\nBut for now, I'll assume it stays put.\n\nSo, my immediate plan is to go to (3,2).\n\nTo do that, I can move left to (3,4), then down to (3,3), then down to (3,2).\n\nGiven that, my first move should be left to (3,4).\n\nBut wait, I'm at (4,4).

If I move DOWN to (3,3), I need to make sure that my body doesn't get in the way.\n\nWait, actually, in snake games, the body moves in the direction you choose, and the tail follows.\n\nBut in this game, since it's a multi-apple snake game, I need to consider that eating apples makes me grow.\n\nAssuming that when I eat an apple, my tail extends, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own tail.\n\nBut for now, since I just started and haven't eaten any apples yet, my body is just the head at (3,4).\n\nWait, actually, in the board state, it shows my snake at (4,4), but in the text, it says (3,4). There might be a confusion here.\n\nLooking back, in the board state, row 4 has \". . . 2 . . . . . .\", which corresponds to column 3.\n\nSo, my snake is at (3,4).\n\nWait, but in the board, rows are numbered from 0 to 9, with 0 at the bottom.\n\nIn the board state provided, my snake is at (3,4), which is row 4, column 3.\n\nBut in the initial position, it says \"Your snake ID: 2 which is currently positioned at (3, 4)\", which matches the board.\n\nOkay, so I'm at (3,4).\n\nNow, to move to (3,3), I need to move down.\n\nWait, no. Coordinates are (column, row), so (3,4) is column 3, row 4.\n\nTo move to (3,3), that's moving down, since lower row numbers are down.\n\nWait, in the board, higher Y values are upwards, so row 4 is higher than row 3.\n\nWait, in the board, row 9 is top, row 0 is bottom.\n\nSo, moving from row 4 to row 3 is moving up.\n\nI think there's confusion in coordinate notation.\n\nLet me clarify: in the board, rows are numbered from 0 to 9, with 0 at the bottom and 9 at the top.\n\nColumns are numbered from 0 to 9, left to right.\n\nSo, position (x,y) is column x, row y.\n\nTherefore, (3,4) is column 3, row 4.\n\nMoving to (3,3) would be moving up one row.\n\nGot it.\n\nSo, to go from (3,4) to (3,3), I need to move UP.\n\nSimilarly, to go from (3,3) to (3,2), I need to move UP again.\n\nSo, to reach (3,2), I need to move UP twice from (3,4).\n\nAlternatively, I could move LEFT to (2,4), but that would take me further from the apple.\n\nWait, no, moving LEFT from (3,4) to (2,4), then UP to (2,3), then UP to (2,2), which is where the enemy is.\n\nThat's not ideal.\n\nSo, moving UP twice to (3,2) seems the best.\n\nBut I need to make sure that the enemy doesn't interfere.\n\nThe enemy is at (2,2), which is not on my path to (3,2), so it should be safe.\n\nTherefore, my first move should be UP to (3,3).\n\nThen, next move UP to (3,2) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLooking at the remaining apples:\n\n- (8,3)\n\n- (0,7)\n\n- (0,3)\n\n- (1,9)\n\nFrom (3,2), the closest apple is (8,3), which is 5 steps to the right and up.\n\nAlternatively, (0,3) is 3 steps left and down.\n\nBut ("

I need to keep an eye on its movements, but for now, it's at (2,2).\n\nGiven that, going to (8,3) seems safer because it's farther from the enemy.\n\nGoing to (0,3) would bring me closer to the enemy, which might not be ideal.\n\nSo, perhaps I should go for (8,3) first.\n\nBut first, I need to get to (4,4) to eat that apple.\n\nOnce I eat (4,4), I'll be longer, so I need to be careful not to run into my own tail.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on getting to (4,4).\n\nSo, from (3,3), I can move right to (4,3), then up to (4,4).\n\nAlternatively, up to (3,4), then right to (4,4).\n\nEither way, it's two steps.\n\nI'll choose to move up to (3,4), then right to (4,4).\n\nWait, but in snake games, you can only move in one direction per turn.\n\nSo, I need to decide which direction to move in this turn.\n\nGiven that, I need to plan a path.\n\nAssuming that I want to move up to (3,4), then right to (4,4).\n\nBut in reality, in snake games, the snake moves its head in the chosen direction, and the rest of the body follows.\n\nSo, if I choose to move up from (3,3) to (3,4), I need to make sure that my tail doesn't block my path.\n\nBut currently, my snake is just a single unit at (3,3), since I haven't eaten any apples yet.\n\nWait, actually, I need to check if I've already eaten any apples.\n\nIn the last move information, it says \"Direction: DOWN\", but I need to see if that move was to eat an apple.\n\nWait, in the last move, I moved DOWN from (3,4) to (3,3).\n\nBut according to the board, there's an apple at (3,2), but I'm now at (3,3).\n\nWait, perhaps I need to clarify my current position.\n\nIn the initial position, it's stated that my snake is at (3,3), but in the board, it's shown at (3,3).\n\nAssuming that I'm at (3,3), and I need to move to (4,4) to eat the apple there.\n\nSo, first move: UP to (3,4).\n\nThen, RIGHT to (4,4).\n\nBut I need to make sure that moving UP to (3,4) is safe.\n\nLooking at the board, (3,4) is empty, so it's safe.\n\nAfter moving to (3,4), I can then move RIGHT to (4,4) to eat the apple.\n\nOnce I eat the apple, my tail will extend, so I need to make sure that I don't run into my own tail in subsequent moves.\n\nBut for now, let's focus on the immediate moves.\n\nSo, in this turn, I should move UP to (3,4).\n\nThen, next turn, move RIGHT to (4,4) to eat the apple.\n\nAfter eating the apple, I need to plan the path to the next apple, which is (8,3).\n\nFrom (4,4), I need to move right 4 steps to (8,4), then down to (8,3) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to be careful because as I grow longer, I have to ensure that I don't run into my own tail.\n\nAlso, I need"
