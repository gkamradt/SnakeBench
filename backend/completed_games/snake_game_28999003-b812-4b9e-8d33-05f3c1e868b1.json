This could potentially set me up for a collision course with snake #1.\n2) I could move up towards the apple at (6, 4), putting some distance between myself and snake #1. The only concern with this strategy is that it might bring me into proximity with the wall, but I should have enough room to navitage.\n\nKeeping in mind that my goal is to gain the most points and avoid running into the wall, other snakes, or myself, I think the best option is to continue moving right to get the apple at (6, 1).

No obstacles, such as enemy snakes or parts of my body, are hindering a direct path toward this apple.\n   \n2. **Strategic Movement Considerations**: Moving DOWN will allow me to eat the apple, grow longer, and score a point. Following this, I can plan subsequent moves to reach further apples such as the one at (5,2), which will be adjacent to me to the west after I collect the apple at (6,1).\n\n3. **Safety and Future Moves**: The enemy snake currently at (3,1) is not in immediate proximity to pose a direct threat, and no walls or other barriers are near my planned path. By moving DOWN and securing the apple, I expand opportunities for future apple collection while maintaining safety from collision threats.\n\n4. **Long-term Strategy**: After consuming the apple at (6,1), I will consider the next closest apple, potentially navigating upward or leftward, based on the enemy snake's movements and other changing board conditions.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN."

            "rationale": "Given the current position of my snake and the positions of the apples, the closest apple is located at (6, 1). I just moved right in my last turn, bringing me closer to this apple. Looking at the board, it seems moving up would take me further away from the apple at (6, 1). However, moving up would move me towards the apple at (6, 4). Currently, enemy snake #1 is positioned at (6, 2) and could pose a threat if it decides to move towards the apple at (6, 1) or (6, 4).\n\nIn the current scenario, I have two primary options to consider:\n1) I could keep moving right towards the apple at (6, 1). This could potentially set me up for a collision course with snake #1.\n2) I could move up towards the apple at (6, 4), putting some distance between myself and snake #1. The only concern with this strategy is that it might bring me into proximity with the wall, but I should have enough room to navitage.\n\nKeeping in mind that my goal is to gain the most points and avoid running into the wall, other snakes, or myself, I think the best option is to continue moving right to get the apple at (6, 1). During my next move, I will need to be cautious of snake #1's position and make a decision accordingly.\n\nNext move: RIGHT."

The path is clear, and moving in this vertical direction positions me well without risking collision with the board edges or other obstacles.\n\n4. **Strategic and Safety Considerations**:\n   - Moving UP ensures I am heading directly toward the closest apple (6, 4). Once this apple is claimed, I can reassess the board to target further apples.\n   - This move also keeps me in a healthier central board position and potentially opens up options to approach the apples located at (5, 8) or even further.\n\n5. **Long-term Strategy Reflection**:\n   - After consuming the apple at (6, 4), essential to recon the position of Snake #2 and check if new apples have appeared in more advantageous spots.\n\nDecided next move: UP."

It's risky especially when it tends to the apple at (6, 1), so I believe it would be a safer move to head towards the apple at (6, 4) by going up which also has another apple at (5, 2) along the way. With a careful strategy, I can still stay in the game and prevent crashing into the walls or other snakes. It\u2019s all about experimenting and learning from past turns. \n\nNext strategy: Continue moving towards (6, 4) or (5, 2), watch out for other snakes and don't get trapped. Keep an eye on the apple at (9,0) as it is isolated with less competition.\n\nNext move: UP\n\n--End of your move information--"
