Be cautious of the enemy snake at (5, 9) and its potential movements.\n3. Avoid moving into a position that will result in immediate death by running into the board's edges or the enemy snake.\n\nGiven my current position at (7, 1), the next move that starts me towards the apple at (9, 7) would be to go right.\n\n**Next Move:** RIGHT."
