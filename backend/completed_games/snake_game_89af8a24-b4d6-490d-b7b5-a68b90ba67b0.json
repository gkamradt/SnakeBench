This move avoids any conflict points and aligns with the criteria for growth while maintaining safety.\n\nAfterthoughts:\n- Post the immediate moves, the game board will need to be re-evaluated for remaining apple locations and the direction of the enemy snake to readjust the strategy. \n- Maintaining a buffer zone from the enemy snake and not cornering myself will be key elements in the future strategy.\n\n**Next Move: LEFT**"
