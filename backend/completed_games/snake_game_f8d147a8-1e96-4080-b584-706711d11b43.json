            "rationale": "Okay, so currently I'm positioned at (8, 8) and there are apples at (6, 4), (9, 8), (2, 5), (0, 6), (6, 3). I want to move to the apple nearest to me while also ensuring that I don't run into any obstacles, including other snakes. The apple at (9, 8) is to my right, which would be a good move, but the apple at (2, 5) or (0, 6) could be better as they might be closer or not involve obstacles. However, based on the current board state, moving to apple at (9, 8) might be a straightforward way to increase my score without risk. But given that Snakes are evolving, I should consider moving to (4, 8) thus changing the path to avoid collision. My next strategy will be maintaining the advantage by considering unexpected visits of other snakes. This also moves me closer to the apple at (2, 5) which brings more score.\n\nMy next move: LEFT."
