            "rationale": "**Thinking out loud:**\n\nMy snake is currently at position **(6, 1)**. Evaluating the possible moves from here:\n\n1. **UP to (6, 2):**\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Moves closer to the apples at **(6, 4)** and **(7, 4)**, increasing the chances of collecting them in subsequent moves.\n     - Maintains central positioning, offering greater flexibility for future movements and access to multiple areas of the board.\n     - Avoids immediate proximity to the enemy snake at **(9, 9)**.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Requires careful navigation in the following turns to avoid getting trapped by my own body as the snake grows.\n\n2. **RIGHT to (7, 1):**\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Heads towards the apple at **(7, 4)** and **(8, 3)**, which are valuable targets.\n     - Keeps the snake on the right side, potentially avoiding congestion in the center.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - May limit upward movement options in the near future.\n     - Slightly increases the risk of getting too close to the enemy snake if paths cross later on.\n\n3. **LEFT to (5, 1):**\n   - **Pros:**\n     - Moves towards the left side of the board, possibly opening up alternative paths.\n     - Reduces immediate competition for central apples.\n   - **Cons:**\n     - Moves away from the majority of available apples, potentially leading to fewer scoring opportunities.\n     - Could result in the snake getting trapped against the board's boundary if not carefully maneuvered.\n\n**Decision:**\n\nConsidering the advantages of maintaining a central position and proximity to multiple apples, moving **UP** to **(6, 2)** is the most strategic choice. This move maximizes potential for collecting apples while keeping movement options open and minimizing immediate risks.\n\n**Strategy for next turn:**\n\nAfter moving **UP**, continue progressing towards the apples at **(6, 4)** and **(7, 4)**. Monitor the enemy snake's position to ensure safe navigation and avoid any potential conflicts. Prioritize collecting nearby apples to increase points while maintaining a flexible position to adapt to future board developments.\n\n**Decided next move:** UP"
