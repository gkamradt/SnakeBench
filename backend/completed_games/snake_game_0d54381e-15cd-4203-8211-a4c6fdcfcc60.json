The apple at (2, 6) is a good immediate target as it is directly in the path upwards.\n\nIn preparation for the next turn, I will consider that the most immediate threat is Snake #1, which could potentially move in any direction but seems to prefer not to increase its x-coordinate based on its current orientation, which is away from Snake #2. If Snake #1 moves predictably, it will allow Snake #2 to avoid reciprocating into a direct conflict.\n\nFor this round, my decision to move UP is aligned with the stated last move information. The goal is to gain points by consuming the apple at (2, 6). Should Snake #1 change its direction and come closer, the approach can be re-evaluated to steer away from any close encounters.\n\nStrategy to tell myself:\nMake sure to maintain awareness of the enemy's position and movements.

Moving down would cause Snake #2 to tail itself or place it closer to the enemy snakes.\n\nTo create a stronger strategy, I will consider that the apples at (2, 6) and (4, 2) are in close range and can be easily reached. The apple at (2, 6) is a good immediate target as it is directly in the path upwards.\n\nIn preparation for the next turn, I will consider that the most immediate threat is Snake #1, which could potentially move in any direction but seems to prefer not to increase its x-coordinate based on its current orientation, which is away from Snake #2. If Snake #1 moves predictably, it will allow Snake #2 to avoid reciprocating into a direct conflict.\n\nFor this round, my decision to move UP is aligned with the stated last move information. The goal is to gain points by consuming the apple at (2, 6). Should Snake #1 change its direction and come closer, the approach can be re-evaluated to steer away from any close encounters.\n\nStrategy to tell myself:\nMake sure to maintain awareness of the enemy's position and movements. After consuming an apple, adjust strategy according to the new landscape, ensuring needs to grow and evade threats are balanced.\n\nNext move: UP"
