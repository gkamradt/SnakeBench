However, with the added body of the enemy snake at (6, 7), it\u2019s essential to avoid getting blocked or attacked by the enemy snake. \n\n### Available Moves:\n1. **UP**: This move takes me to (5, 9), which is safe but doesn't bring me closer to any apple.\n2. **DOWN**: Moving to (5, 7) puts me on a better path to head towards the apple located at (6, 4) and away from the enemy's body.\n3. **LEFT**: This move to (4, 8) isn\u2019t ideal; it takes me away from the current closest apple and doesn't provide strategic positioning.\n4. **RIGHT**: Moves me to (6, 8), presenting a potential future opportunity to be closer to either (6, 6) or (6, 4).\n\n### Strategy:\n- Considering the proximity to the apple at (6, 4) and avoiding the risk posed by the enemy snake located near (6, 6), moving **DOWN** aligns my path to effectively reach one of the closer apples while avoiding immediate threats.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe best strategic move at this point is to move **DOWN** to (5, 7). This keeps me on a safe trajectory to potentially reach an apple next round, increasing my score while ensuring I'm not immediately near the enemy snake. \n\n### Strategy for Next Turn:\nOnce moving to (5, 7), assess the enemy snake's movement.
