            "rationale": "Alright, let's see here. I'm playing this multi-apple Snake game on a 10x10 grid. My snake is number 2, and I'm currently at position (4,9). There are apples at (3,2), (2,8), (9,7), (4,3), and (5,7). There's also an enemy snake at (9,8), but it doesn't have any body parts listed, so maybe it's just the head.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the board layout. The coordinates go from (0,0) at the bottom left to (9,9) at the top right. So, higher Y coordinates are towards the top. My position at (4,9) is near the top, in the middle horizontally.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully to eat apples and avoid hitting walls, myself, or the enemy snake. The enemy is at (9,8), which is near the top right corner. I should keep an eye on its position, but since it doesn't have any body parts, it might be smaller or just starting out.\n\nLet me visualize the board. Here's what I think it looks like:\n\nRow 9: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . A . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 7: . . . . . A . . . A\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (2,8)\n\n- (9,7)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (5,7)\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (9,8).\n\nMy snake 2 is at (4,9).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple is closest to me and plan a path to it. Let's look at the distances.\n\nLet's use Manhattan distance since the snake can only move grid by grid horizontally or vertically.\n\nFrom (4,9) to:\n\n- (3,2): |4-3| + |9-2| = 1 + 7 = 8\n\n- (2,8): |4-2| + |9-8| = 2 + 1 = 3\n\n- (9,7): |4-9| + |9-7| = 5 + 2 = 7\n\n- (4,3): |4-4| + |9-3| = 0 + 6 = 6\n\n- (5,7): |4-5| + |9-7| = 1 + 2 = 3\n\nSo, the apples at (2,8) and (5,7) are both 3 steps away. Which one to choose?\n\nI should consider which path is safer and which might lead to more apples.\n\nLet's consider going to (2,8) first.\n\nFrom (4,9) to (2,8):\n\nOption 1:\n\n- Left to (3,9)\n\n- Left to (2,9)\n\n- Down to (2,8)\n\nThat's three steps, but looking at the board, there might be obstacles.\n\nWait, there's an apple at (2,8), and an enemy snake at (9,8). I need to make sure the path is clear.\n\nSimilarly, going to (5,7):\n\nFrom (4,9):\n\n- Down to (4,8)\n\n- Down to (4,7)\n\n- Right to (5,7)\n\nAgain, check for obstacles.\n\nI need to be careful not to run into the enemy snake or its body. But since its body is empty, maybe it's just the head at (9,8).\n\nAlso, I need to consider my snake's length. Every time I eat an apple, I grow longer, so I need to make sure I don't run into my own body.\n\nWait, I don't know how long my snake is. Since I've probably eaten some apples already, I need to consider that.\n\nMaybe I should assume my snake is just the head for now, and adjust later.\n\nLet me think about possible paths.\n\nFirst, let's consider moving towards (5,7):\n\nFrom (4,9):\n\n- Down to (4,8)\n\n- Down to (4,7)\n\n- Right to (5,7)\n\nLet's see if there are any obstacles in this path.\n\nAt (4,8): looking at the board, row 8, column 4: it's empty.\n\nAt (4,7): row 7, column 4: it's empty.\n\nAt (5,7): that's the apple.\n\nSo, this path seems clear.\n\nSimilarly, moving towards (2,8):\n\nFrom (4,9):\n\n- Left to (3,9)\n\n- Left to (2,9)\n\n- Down to (2,8)\n\nCheck:\n\n(3,9): empty.\n\n(2,9): empty.\n\n(2,8): apple.\n\nAlso clear.\n\nSo, both paths are equally distant, and both are clear.\n\nWhich one should I choose?\n\nMaybe consider which path leads to more apples.\n\nAfter eating (5,7), the next closest apple would be (4,3), which is |5-4| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5 steps.\n\nAfter eating (2,8), the next closest apple is (3,2), which is |2-3| + |8-2| = 1 + 6 = 7 steps.\n\nSo, going to (5,7) seems better because the next apple is closer compared to going to (2,8).\n\nAlternatively, after eating (2,8), the next apple at (2,7) is not present, so maybe reconsider.\n\nWait, apples are at (3,2), (2,8), (9,7), (4,3), (5,7).\n\nAfter (5,7), (4,3) is closer than after (2,8).\n\nSo, maybe go for (5,7).\n\nBut, I need to consider the enemy snake at (9,8). If I move down towards (5,7), I might get in its way.\n\nWait, the enemy is at (9,8), and I'm at (4,9). If I move down to (4,8), then to (4,7), then right to (5,7).\n\nAt (4,8), I'm in the same row as the enemy at (9,8). But since snakes can't occupy the same space, I need to make sure the enemy isn't moving towards me.\n\nBut I don't have information about the enemy's direction or intelligence. Maybe it's moving left towards me.\n\nAlternatively, if I go left to (3,9), then (2,9), then down to (2,8), I'm moving away from the enemy.\n\nPerhaps that's safer.\n\nBut, as per the earlier calculation, going to (5,7) leads to a closer next apple.\n\nI need to balance between safety and efficiency.\n\nMaybe I should consider both options.\n\nOption A: Go to (5,7)\n\nPath: Down to (4,8), down to (4,7), right to (5,7)\n\nOption B: Go to (2,8)\n\nPath: Left to (3,9), left to (2,9), down to (2,8)\n\nLet me think about potential risks.\n\nIn Option A, moving down towards (4,8), I'm getting closer to the enemy at (9,8). If the enemy moves left towards me, we might collide.\n\nIn Option B, moving left to (3,9), then (2,9), then down to (2,8), I'm moving away from the enemy.\n\nPerhaps Option B is safer.\n\nAlso, after eating (2,8), the next apple is at (3,2), which is further away, but at least I'm moving away from the enemy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a way to eat both apples in a more efficient path.\n\nLet me see.\n\nIf I go to (5,7) first, eat it, then go to (4,3), which is nearby.\n\nAfter eating (5,7), my position would be (5,7), and then to (4,3) is only 1 left and 4 downs.\n\nThat's efficient.\n\nAlternatively, if I go to (2,8), eat it, then go to (3,2), which is right below it.\n\nFrom (2,8), down to (2,7), then right to (3,2).\n\nWait, (3,2) is at row 2, column 3.\n\nFrom (2,8), down to (2,7), then right to (3,7), then down to (3,6), and so on until (3,2). That's quite a few steps.\n\nSo, going to (5,7) seems better in terms of efficiency.\n\nBut, I need to consider the risk of running into the enemy.\n\nMaybe I can try to predict the enemy's movement.\n\nThe enemy is at (9,8), and its only move is to left, right"

My position at (5,9) is near the top, in the middle horizontally.\n\nI need to plan my moves carefully to eat apples and avoid hitting walls, myself, or the enemy snake. The enemy is at (8,8), which is near the top right corner. I should keep an eye on its position, but since it doesn't have any body parts, it might be smaller or just starting out.\n\nLet me visualize the board. Here's what I think it looks like:\n\nRow 9: . . . . 2 . . . . .\n\nRow 8: . . A . . . . . . 1\n\nRow 7: . . . . . A . . . A\n\nRow 6: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 5: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 4: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 3: . . . . A . . . . .\n\nRow 2: . . . A . . . . . .\n\nRow 1: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nRow 0: . . . . . . . . . .\n\nColumns: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9\n\nSo, apples are at:\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (2,8)\n\n- (9,7)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (5,7)\n\nEnemy snake 1 is at (8,8).\n\nMy snake 2 is at (5,9).\n\nI need to decide my next move: up, down, left, or right.\n\nFirst, I should consider which apple is closest to me and plan a path to it. Let's look at the distances.\n\nLet's use Manhattan distance since the snake can only move grid by grid horizontally or vertically.\n\nFrom (5,9) to:\n\n- (3,2): |5-3| + |9-2| = 2 + 7 = 9\n\n- (2,8): |5-2| + |9-8| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n- (9,7): |5-9| + |9-7| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- (4,3): |5-4| + |9-3| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n- (5,7): |5-5| + |9-7| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\nWait, I think there's a mistake in my earlier calculation. Let's recalculate the distances properly.\n\nFrom (5,9):\n\n- To (3,2): |5-3| + |9-2| = 2 + 7 = 9\n\n- To (2,8): |5-2| + |9-8| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n- To (9,7): |5-9| + |9-7| = 4 + 2 = 6\n\n- To (4,3): |5-4| + |9-3| = 1 + 6 = 7\n\n- To (5,7): |5-5| + |9-7| = 0 + 2 = 2\n\nOkay, so the closest apple is at (5,7) with a distance of 2. That's directly down from my current position.\n\nLet me consider moving down to (5,8), then to (5,7) to eat the apple.\n\nBut I need to make sure that path is clear.\n\nAt (5,8): looking at the board, row 8, column 5: it's empty.\n\nAt (5,7): that's the apple.\n\nSo, moving down to (5,8), then down to (5,7) seems straightforward.\n\nAfter eating the apple at (5,7), I need to decide where to go next.\n\nLet's see the next closest apple.\n\nFrom (5,7):\n\n- To (3,2): |5-3| + |7-2| = 2 + 5 = 7\n\n- To (2,8): |5-2| + |7-8| = 3 + 1 = 4\n\n- To (9,7): |5-9| + |7-7| = 4 + 0 = 4\n\n- To (4,3): |5-4| + |7-3| = 1 + 4 = 5\n\nSo, the closest apples are now (2,8) and (9,7), both at a distance of 4.\n\nI need to decide which one to go for next.\n\nLet's consider the path to (9,7):\n\nFrom (5,7):\n\n- Right to (6,7)\n\n- Right to (7,7)\n\n- Right to (8,7)\n\n- Right to (9,7)\n\nThat's four steps.\n\nAlternatively, path to (2,8):\n\nFrom (5,7):\n\n- Up to (5,8)\n\n- Left to (4,8)\n\n- Left to (3,8)\n\n- Left to (2,8)\n\nThat's also four steps.\n\nSo, both are equidistant.\n\nI need to consider other factors.\n\nLooking at the board, the enemy is at (8,8). If I go towards (9,7), I might get closer to the enemy, which could be risky.\n\nOn the other hand, going to (2,8) moves me away from the enemy.\n\nPerhaps it's safer to go for (2,8) first.\n\nAlso, after eating (2,8), the next apple would be (3,2), which is closer than the other apples.\n\nFrom (2,8):\n\n- Down to (2,7)\n\n- Right to (3,7)\n\n- Down to (3,6)\n\n- Down to (3,5)\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\n- Right to (4,3)\n\n- Right to (5,3)\n\n- Down to (5,2)\n\n- Right to (6,2)\n\n- Right to (7,2)\n\n- Right to (8,2)\n\n- Right to (9,2)\n\nWait, that's a long path. Maybe I'm overcomplicating it.\n\nLet's recalculate from (2,8) to (3,2):\n\n- Right to (3,8)\n\n- Down to (3,7)\n\n- Down to (3,6)\n\n- Down to (3,5)\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\nThat's 6 steps.\n\nAlternatively, from (5,7) to (9,7):\n\n- Right to (6,7)\n\n- Right to (7,7)\n\n- Right to (8,7)\n\n- Right to (9,7)\n\nThat's 4 steps.\n\nAfter eating (9,7), the next closest apple is (3,2):\n\n- Left to (8,7)\n\n- Left to (7,7)\n\n- Left to (6,7)\n\n- Left to (5,7)\n\n- Left to (4,7)\n\n- Left to (3,7)\n\n- Down to (3,6)\n\n- Down to (3,5)\n\n- Down to (3,4)\n\n- Down to (3,3)\n\n- Down to (3,2)\n\nThat's 10 steps.\n\nSo, going to (2,8) after (5,7) seems better in terms of the next apple's proximity.\n\nWait, perhaps I need a better way to plan this.\n\nMaybe I should think about the sequence of apples to eat that minimizes total movement.\n\nThis sounds like a traveling salesman problem, which is complex, but maybe I can simplify it.\n\nAlternatively, I can prioritize apples based on their positions to maximize efficiency.\n\nLooking at the positions:\n\n- (3,2)\n\n- (2,8)\n\n- (9,7)\n\n- (4,3)\n\n- (5,7)\n\nIf I eat (5,7), then (2,8), then (3,2), then (4,3), then (9,7), let's see the total steps.\n\nFrom (5,9) to (5,7): 2 steps down.\n\nFrom (5,7) to (2,8): 3 up and 1 left, total 4 steps.\n\nFrom (2,8) to (3,2): 1 right and 6 down, total 7 steps.\n\nFrom (3,2) to (4,3): 1 right and 1 up, total 2 steps.\n\nFrom (4,3) to (9,7): 5 right and 4 up, total 9 steps.\n\nTotal steps: 2 + 4 + 7 + 2 + 9 = 24 steps.\n\nAlternatively, another order:\n\n(5,7) -> (9,7) -> (2,8"
