This could be a safer choice as it would put more distance between me and the enemy snake, but it's a longer path to the next apple.\n\nI should also consider the apple at (8, 0) as it's relatively far away, but if I move towards the left side of the board now, it might make it harder to reach that apple later without getting too close to the enemy snake.\n\nAfter evaluating the positions, I think it's best to move DOWN for this turn, towards the apple at (3, 6). This will get me closer to that apple while still maintaining a safe distance from the enemy snake. I can then re-evaluate the situation in the next turn and potentially move towards the (0, 4) apple or adjust my strategy based on the enemy snake's movements.\n\nStrategy for the next turn: If I successfully reach the (3, 6) apple, I should consider moving towards the (0, 4) apple next, as it would be the closest one from there. However, I need to keep an eye on the enemy snake's position and be prepared to change course if it starts moving closer to me or if a better opportunity arises.\n\nNext move: DOWN"
