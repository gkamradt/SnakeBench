            "move": "DOWN",
            "rationale": "Let's analyze the current situation. Our snake is currently at position (3, 9) and we have multiple apples available. We previously decided to move up towards the apple at position (3, 7), but we've already reached the top of the board.\n\nLooking at the board, we can see that there's an apple at position (3, 7), but it's below us now. We also have an apple at position (3, 5) which is two units down from our current position. This apple is closer to us than the other available apples, and it's also safer since we won't be heading towards the enemy snake.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After moving down to the apple at position (3, 5), I'll reassess the situation and consider moving towards the apple at position (6, 6) or another available apple.\n\nDecided next move: DOWN"
