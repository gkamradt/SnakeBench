This would give me more flexibility in my movements and keep me away from the walls.\n\n3. Consider the apple at (1, 9): Although this apple is further away, it could be a good long-term goal. Moving towards it would allow me to stay near the center of the board.\n\nBased on the current situation, I think my best move is to go right and get the apple at (5, 5). After that, if the enemy snake is still far away, I could consider going for the apple at (9, 6). However, if the enemy snake moves closer, I should prioritize moving towards the center of the board and possibly aim for the apple at (1, 9) in the long run.\n\nStrategy for next turn: After getting the apple at (5, 5), reassess the enemy snake's position. If it's still far away, consider going for the apple at (9, 6). Otherwise, focus on moving towards the center of the board and possibly aim for the apple at (1, 9) as a long-term goal. Avoid getting too close to the walls or the enemy snake.\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
