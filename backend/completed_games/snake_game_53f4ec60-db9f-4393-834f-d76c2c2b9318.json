Given its proximity to the apple at (9, 4), it might potentially contest that apple.\n\n**Current Strategy Plan:**\n- Assessing the paths to the nearest apples, the path to (9, 4) is immediately attractive because it's only two spaces away and involves moving to the RIGHT followed by DOWN.\n- By moving RIGHT, I track closest to the apple at (9, 4) while also maintaining a relative proximity to the center of the board, which helps react to enemy movements or other apple locations as they become more pertinent.\n\n**Subsequent Turns Planning:**\n- After securing the apple at (9, 4), I should reassess Snake #2\u2019s position to avoid it turning into a direct threat, either from its potential growth or direct encounter.\n- Next, I might consider moving DOWN to broaden my area and opportunistically check for any newly dropped apples on the lower part of the board.\n\n**Potential Threats:**\n- The main consideration remains the movements of Snake #2, especially how they respond to my move towards the apple at (9, 4). I need to stay vigilant about it moving horizontally or vertically towards the same goal.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT\n\nBy moving RIGHT, I approach the apple at (9, 4), making it a strategic goal to grow and potentially block Snake #2 from reaching that same apple, thereby enhancing my stance both in points and board control."

After consuming the apple at (8, 6), turn right to aim for the apple at (9, 4). \n- Always keep an awareness of any changes in snake #2's position to avoid collision and adjust the path accordingly.\n\nDecided next move: UP."

The option to move DOWN again would imperil my snake as it would go out of bounds and thus, that path is eliminated.\n- Reviewing the map, the closest apples are now at (6, 5), (3, 7), and further ones at (1, 9) and (8, 6). Heading towards (8, 6) first would be strategic as it keeps the latter options open and ensures I am not restricted in a corner.\n- The enemy snake (#2) remains at (2, 4) without further growth, and still does not represent an immediate threat. However, I need to maintain a watchful eye on its movement as I proceed towards other apples. \n\n**Strategy for Next Move:**\n- Moving UP or RIGHT are both plausible moves. An UP move will bipass the boundaries successfully and keep me on a vertical path which could be advantageous. However, a move to the RIGHT will lead towards the center of the board, thus opening more routes for strategic maneuvers and good positions for future apple captures.\n- Once on the right path, continual assessment of apple locations and enemy snake maneuvers will help refine subsequent moves.\n  \n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT\nThis move will place my snake at (9, 3), positioning it within a strategic reach of other apples while ensuring that I avoid any immediate danger."
