This is a good move!\n\n- **DOWN (to (3, 5))**: This move is safe, but it doesn't yield any points since there's no apple there.\n\n- **LEFT (to (2, 6))**: This move is also safe, but again, there\u2019s no apple at (2, 6).\n\n- **RIGHT (to (4, 6))**: This move is safe, but does not lead to an apple.\n\nGiven this analysis, moving UP to (3, 7) is clearly the optimal choice because it allows me to collect an apple and gain a point.\n\n**Strategy for next turn**: After I grow and occupy (3, 7), I can evaluate my next moves to see if any apples are within reach for my future turns.\n\nSo, I will move UP."
