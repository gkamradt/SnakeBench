The other snake is positioned with its head at (7, 7) and a body part at (6, 7). The board configuration and my position give me a few strategic choices for my next move.\n\n**Assessment of Move Options:**\n1. **UP** to (1, 6): This move takes me closer vertically to the apple at (5, 8), positioning myself for future moves to the center apples. However, this move doesn't yet position me closer horizontally to any target.\n\n2. **DOWN** to (1, 4): Moving down moves me further away from the nearest apple at (5, 8) but brings me closer to the edge of the board. This could be strategic for fetching the apple at (1, 0) if we aim to swing around to the bottom left, though it appears a longer route.\n\n3. **LEFT** to (0, 5): This move is dangerous as it puts me closer to the left edge of the board. Immediate apples are not reachable from this direction, and it would limit my future options heavily.\n\n4. **RIGHT** to (2, 5): Pushing right opens the grid more and provides future access upwards towards the upper apples and rightwards towards the center. This move pivots me away from the wall and avoids immediate conflicts with the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nMoving right on previous turns has started to position me towards the center of the board, where multiple apples are closer. The enemy snake is located more towards the upper right and might also be targeting the apple at (9, 3) or (5, 8). Keeping some distance and preparing to pivot towards an opening for an apple without conflict is crucial.\n\n**Next Move Thought:**\nContinuing RIGHT seems like the most strategic move to maintain flexibility, reach the center apples more effectively in future turns, and avoid any immediate risk of hitting the walls or running into the enemy snake. After this move, I should reassess the game board depending on where the enemy moves and possibly consider moving UP towards the apple at (5, 8).\n\n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT"

However, this move doesn't yet position me closer horizontally to any target.\n\n2. **DOWN** to (1, 4): Moving down moves me further away from the nearest apple at (5, 8) but brings me closer to the edge of the board.

The other snake is positioned with its head at (7, 7) and a body part at (6, 7). The board configuration and my position give me a few strategic choices for my next move.\n\n**Assessment of Move Options:**\n1. **UP** to (1, 6): This move takes me closer vertically to the apple at (5, 8), positioning myself for future moves to the center apples. However, this move doesn't yet position me closer horizontally to any target.\n\n2. **DOWN** to (1, 4): Moving down moves me further away from the nearest apple at (5, 8) but brings me closer to the edge of the board. This could be strategic for fetching the apple at (1, 0) if we aim to swing around to the bottom left, though it appears a longer route.\n\n3. **LEFT** to (0, 5): This move is dangerous as it puts me closer to the left edge of the board. Immediate apples are not reachable from this direction, and it would limit my future options heavily.\n\n4. **RIGHT** to (2, 5): Pushing right opens the grid more and provides future access upwards towards the upper apples and rightwards towards the center. This move pivots me away from the wall and avoids immediate conflicts with the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nMoving right on previous turns has started to position me towards the center of the board, where multiple apples are closer. The enemy snake is located more towards the upper right and might also be targeting the apple at (9, 3) or (5, 8). Keeping some distance and preparing to pivot towards an opening for an apple without conflict is crucial.\n\n**Next Move Thought:**\nContinuing RIGHT seems like the most strategic move to maintain flexibility, reach the center apples more effectively in future turns, and avoid any immediate risk of hitting the walls or running into the enemy snake. After this move, I should reassess the game board depending on where the enemy moves and possibly consider moving UP towards the apple at (5, 8).\n\n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT"

It's a strategic option, keeping me centralized and making a future path to the north apples more feasible.\n\n2. **DOWN** to (2, 4): This would take me further away from the nearest immediate apple (5, 8) and is less advantageous. The proximity to the edges increases risk, particularly with limited benefits or strategic positioning for apple collection.\n\n3. **LEFT** to (1, 5): While still keeping away from the walls, this move does not provide evident strategic benefits towards apple collection.

The other snake is positioned with its head at (7, 7) and a body part at (6, 7).

However, this move doesn't yet position me closer horizontally to any target.\n\n2. **DOWN** to (1, 4): Moving down moves me further away from the nearest apple at (5, 8) but brings me closer to the edge of the board. This could be strategic for fetching the apple at (1, 0) if we aim to swing around to the bottom left, though it appears a longer route.\n\n3. **LEFT** to (0, 5): This move is dangerous as it puts me closer to the left edge of the board. Immediate apples are not reachable from this direction, and it would limit my future options heavily.\n\n4. **RIGHT** to (2, 5): Pushing right opens the grid more and provides future access upwards towards the upper apples and rightwards towards the center. This move pivots me away from the wall and avoids immediate conflicts with the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nMoving right on previous turns has started to position me towards the center of the board, where multiple apples are closer. The enemy snake is located more towards the upper right and might also be targeting the apple at (9, 3) or (5, 8). Keeping some distance and preparing to pivot towards an opening for an apple without conflict is crucial.\n\n**Next Move Thought:**\nContinuing RIGHT seems like the most strategic move to maintain flexibility, reach the center apples more effectively in future turns, and avoid any immediate risk of hitting the walls or running into the enemy snake. After this move, I should reassess the game board depending on where the enemy moves and possibly consider moving UP towards the apple at (5, 8).\n\n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT"

Immediate apples are not reachable from this direction, and it would limit my future options heavily.\n\n4. **RIGHT** to (2, 5): Pushing right opens the grid more and provides future access upwards towards the upper apples and rightwards towards the center. This move pivots me away from the wall and avoids immediate conflicts with the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nMoving right on previous turns has started to position me towards the center of the board, where multiple apples are closer. The enemy snake is located more towards the upper right and might also be targeting the apple at (9, 3) or (5, 8). Keeping some distance and preparing to pivot towards an opening for an apple without conflict is crucial.\n\n**Next Move Thought:**\nContinuing RIGHT seems like the most strategic move to maintain flexibility, reach the center apples more effectively in future turns, and avoid any immediate risk of hitting the walls or running into the enemy snake. After this move, I should reassess the game board depending on where the enemy moves and possibly consider moving UP towards the apple at (5, 8).\n\n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT"

Immediate apples are not reachable from this direction, and it would limit my future options heavily.\n\n4. **RIGHT** to (2, 5): Pushing right opens the grid more and provides future access upwards towards the upper apples and rightwards towards the center. This move pivots me away from the wall and avoids immediate conflicts with the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nMoving right on previous turns has started to position me towards the center of the board, where multiple apples are closer. The enemy snake is located more towards the upper right and might also be targeting the apple at (9, 3) or (5, 8). Keeping some distance and preparing to pivot towards an opening for an apple without conflict is crucial.\n\n**Next Move Thought:**\nContinuing RIGHT seems like the most strategic move to maintain flexibility, reach the center apples more effectively in future turns, and avoid any immediate risk of hitting the walls or running into the enemy snake. After this move, I should reassess the game board depending on where the enemy moves and possibly consider moving UP towards the apple at (5, 8).\n\n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT"

Thus, I will choose this while henceforth considering moving downwards or right again to either head for the (1,0) or center apples or to adjust based on the enemy's position.\n\nFor the next moves, I need to keep in mind the enemy's position and check whether it is closing into any apple that I am targeting. I should also consider maximizing my growth by steering clear of potential traps or confining spaces.\n\nDecision: **RIGHT**."

The other snake is positioned with its head at (7, 7) and a body part at (6, 7). The board configuration and my position give me a few strategic choices for my next move.\n\n**Assessment of Move Options:**\n1. **UP** to (1, 6): This move takes me closer vertically to the apple at (5, 8), positioning myself for future moves to the center apples. However, this move doesn't yet position me closer horizontally to any target.\n\n2. **DOWN** to (1, 4): Moving down moves me further away from the nearest apple at (5, 8) but brings me closer to the edge of the board. This could be strategic for fetching the apple at (1, 0) if we aim to swing around to the bottom left, though it appears a longer route.\n\n3. **LEFT** to (0, 5): This move is dangerous as it puts me closer to the left edge of the board. Immediate apples are not reachable from this direction, and it would limit my future options heavily.\n\n4. **RIGHT** to (2, 5): Pushing right opens the grid more and provides future access upwards towards the upper apples and rightwards towards the center. This move pivots me away from the wall and avoids immediate conflicts with the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nMoving right on previous turns has started to position me towards the center of the board, where multiple apples are closer. The enemy snake is located more towards the upper right and might also be targeting the apple at (9, 3) or (5, 8). Keeping some distance and preparing to pivot towards an opening for an apple without conflict is crucial.\n\n**Next Move Thought:**\nContinuing RIGHT seems like the most strategic move to maintain flexibility, reach the center apples more effectively in future turns, and avoid any immediate risk of hitting the walls or running into the enemy snake. After this move, I should reassess the game board depending on where the enemy moves and possibly consider moving UP towards the apple at (5, 8).\n\n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT"

The other snake is positioned with its head at (7, 7) and a body part at (6, 7). The board configuration and my position give me a few strategic choices for my next move.\n\n**Assessment of Move Options:**\n1. **UP** to (1, 6): This move takes me closer vertically to the apple at (5, 8), positioning myself for future moves to the center apples. However, this move doesn't yet position me closer horizontally to any target.\n\n2. **DOWN** to (1, 4): Moving down moves me further away from the nearest apple at (5, 8) but brings me closer to the edge of the board. This could be strategic for fetching the apple at (1, 0) if we aim to swing around to the bottom left, though it appears a longer route.\n\n3. **LEFT** to (0, 5): This move is dangerous as it puts me closer to the left edge of the board. Immediate apples are not reachable from this direction, and it would limit my future options heavily.\n\n4. **RIGHT** to (2, 5): Pushing right opens the grid more and provides future access upwards towards the upper apples and rightwards towards the center. This move pivots me away from the wall and avoids immediate conflicts with the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nMoving right on previous turns has started to position me towards the center of the board, where multiple apples are closer. The enemy snake is located more towards the upper right and might also be targeting the apple at (9, 3) or (5, 8). Keeping some distance and preparing to pivot towards an opening for an apple without conflict is crucial.\n\n**Next Move Thought:**\nContinuing RIGHT seems like the most strategic move to maintain flexibility, reach the center apples more effectively in future turns, and avoid any immediate risk of hitting the walls or running into the enemy snake. After this move, I should reassess the game board depending on where the enemy moves and possibly consider moving UP towards the apple at (5, 8).\n\n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT"

It's a strategic option, keeping me centralized and making a future path to the north apples more feasible.\n\n2. **DOWN** to (2, 4): This would take me further away from the nearest immediate apple (5, 8) and is less advantageous.

The path is currently unobstructed by other snakes or tail segments.\n- Avoiding unnecessary turns until the apple is secured will minimize risk since Snake #2 is currently not a direct threat to my path.\n- After capturing the apple at (5, 0), I need to assess the best route rightwards towards the higher right corner of the board while keeping an eye on any movements of Snake #2 that might obstruct a potential path to the next targets.\n\n**Environmental Considerations:**\n- There are no walls or obstacles impeding the direct downward path to the apple at (5,0). Self-collision is also not a concern right now as no segments of my snake are obstructing this path.\n\n**Future Strategy Reminder:**\n- After obtaining the apple at (5, 0), plan your route towards (9, 3), considering shortest paths and avoiding any potential interceptions with Snake #2. If possible, keep track of the enemy's movements and predict their potential paths, staying clear of direct confrontations unless having a distinct advantage.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** DOWN"

However, this move doesn't yet position me closer horizontally to any target.\n\n2. **DOWN** to (1, 4): Moving down moves me further away from the nearest apple at (5, 8) but brings me closer to the edge of the board. This could be strategic for fetching the apple at (1, 0) if we aim to swing around to the bottom left, though it appears a longer route.\n\n3. **LEFT** to (0, 5): This move is dangerous as it puts me closer to the left edge of the board. Immediate apples are not reachable from this direction, and it would limit my future options heavily.\n\n4. **RIGHT** to (2, 5): Pushing right opens the grid more and provides future access upwards towards the upper apples and rightwards towards the center. This move pivots me away from the wall and avoids immediate conflicts with the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nMoving right on previous turns has started to position me towards the center of the board, where multiple apples are closer. The enemy snake is located more towards the upper right and might also be targeting the apple at (9, 3) or (5, 8). Keeping some distance and preparing to pivot towards an opening for an apple without conflict is crucial.\n\n**Next Move Thought:**\nContinuing RIGHT seems like the most strategic move to maintain flexibility, reach the center apples more effectively in future turns, and avoid any immediate risk of hitting the walls or running into the enemy snake. After this move, I should reassess the game board depending on where the enemy moves and possibly consider moving UP towards the apple at (5, 8).\n\n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT"

The other snake is positioned with its head at (7, 7) and a body part at (6, 7). The board configuration and my position give me a few strategic choices for my next move.\n\n**Assessment of Move Options:**\n1. **UP** to (1, 6): This move takes me closer vertically to the apple at (5, 8), positioning myself for future moves to the center apples. However, this move doesn't yet position me closer horizontally to any target.\n\n2. **DOWN** to (1, 4): Moving down moves me further away from the nearest apple at (5, 8) but brings me closer to the edge of the board. This could be strategic for fetching the apple at (1, 0) if we aim to swing around to the bottom left, though it appears a longer route.\n\n3. **LEFT** to (0, 5): This move is dangerous as it puts me closer to the left edge of the board. Immediate apples are not reachable from this direction, and it would limit my future options heavily.\n\n4. **RIGHT** to (2, 5): Pushing right opens the grid more and provides future access upwards towards the upper apples and rightwards towards the center. This move pivots me away from the wall and avoids immediate conflicts with the enemy snake.\n\n**Strategic Consideration:**\nMoving right on previous turns has started to position me towards the center of the board, where multiple apples are closer. The enemy snake is located more towards the upper right and might also be targeting the apple at (9, 3) or (5, 8). Keeping some distance and preparing to pivot towards an opening for an apple without conflict is crucial.\n\n**Next Move Thought:**\nContinuing RIGHT seems like the most strategic move to maintain flexibility, reach the center apples more effectively in future turns, and avoid any immediate risk of hitting the walls or running into the enemy snake. After this move, I should reassess the game board depending on where the enemy moves and possibly consider moving UP towards the apple at (5, 8).\n\n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT"

Considering my position, both of them are towards the right side of the board.\n\n**Considerations:**\n- Enemy snake #2 is located around the top center of the board with their head at (1, 6) and their direction could either maintain in the surrounding area or adjust depending on their strategy.\n- If I plan to move towards the right side apples, it's crucial to avoid any potential confrontation paths with Snake #2, especially in a direct manner.\n\n**Strategy Discussion:**\n- With my current location being at the far left half of the board, advancing towards (9, 0) or (9, 3) will require a strategic navigation mainly in the RIGHT direction.\n- I need to be careful of not running into my tail as my size increases, as well as maintaining a safe distance from the walls and the enemy snake.\n\n**Immediate Next Steps:**\n1. My immediate route is clear towards the right, so starting to head RIGHT from the current position (5, 0) allows me to gradually make my way towards the apples located at (9, 0) and (9, 3).\n2. On my route RIGHT, I will have to monitor the position and potential moves of Snake #2 to adjust my subsequent path optimally to avoid any collisions.\n\n**Plan on Subsequent Turns:**\n- Continue tracking Snake #2's movements.\n- Assess potential risks of collision or getting cornered due to the board edges or increasing snake length.\n\n**Decided Next Move:** RIGHT. This decision is based on starting my journey towards the right-side apples while keeping potential adjustments in mind based on the enemy snake movements and board conditions."
