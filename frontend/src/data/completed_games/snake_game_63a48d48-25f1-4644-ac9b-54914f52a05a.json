Moving downward to (6, 0) seems risky as it brings me close to the boundary of the board with potential bad paths afterward.\n  \n- **Apple at (1, 2)**: This apple is quite far and will involve crossing potentially complex paths that may risk running into other entities.\n\n- **Apple at (3, 5)**: This is on the upper side of the board and represents an approach that doesn't head towards the boundary immediately.\n\n- **Apple at (7, 6)**: Heading towards this apple seems relatively safe from my current position.

Moving downward to (6, 0) seems risky as it brings me close to the boundary of the board with potential bad paths afterward.\n  \n- **Apple at (1, 2)**: This apple is quite far and will involve crossing potentially complex paths that may risk running into other entities.\n\n- **Apple at (3, 5)**: This is on the upper side of the board and represents an approach that doesn't head towards the boundary immediately.\n\n- **Apple at (7, 6)**: Heading towards this apple seems relatively safe from my current position.

Moving downward to (6, 0) seems risky as it brings me close to the boundary of the board with potential bad paths afterward.\n  \n- **Apple at (1, 2)**: This apple is quite far and will involve crossing potentially complex paths that may risk running into other entities.\n\n- **Apple at (3, 5)**: This is on the upper side of the board and represents an approach that doesn't head towards the boundary immediately.\n\n- **Apple at (7, 6)**: Heading towards this apple seems relatively safe from my current position. It involves moving upward and rightward, maintaining a degree of safety by keeping away from edges.\n\n### Decision:\nSince I am at (9, 4), moving towards (7, 6) seems like the most efficient strategy as it keeps my movements close to the center and away from immediate danger.

Moving downward to (6, 0) seems risky as it brings me close to the boundary of the board with potential bad paths afterward.\n  \n- **Apple at (1, 2)**: This apple is quite far and will involve crossing potentially complex paths that may risk running into other entities.\n\n- **Apple at (3, 5)**: This is on the upper side of the board and represents an approach that doesn't head towards the boundary immediately.\n\n- **Apple at (7, 6)**: Heading towards this apple seems relatively safe from my current position. It involves moving upward and rightward, maintaining a degree of safety by keeping away from edges.\n\n### Decision:\nSince I am at (9, 4), moving towards (7, 6) seems like the most efficient strategy as it keeps my movements close to the center and away from immediate danger.
