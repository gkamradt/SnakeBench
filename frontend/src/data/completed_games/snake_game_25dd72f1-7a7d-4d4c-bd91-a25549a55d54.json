Therefore, we do not need to take it into consideration for this move.\n\nWe shouldn't move left, as it would take us away from our target apple. Moving down also does not make sense in this scenario as it will also take us away from the apple. If we move right, we'd hit the wall and hence lose, so it is also not a valid option. Our only logical move is to move up to maintain our current y-coordinate and not lose distance from the target apple. Once we have lined up with the x-coordinate of the apple in the next turn, we would then make a move to the left.\n\nDecided next move: UP."

Prioritize collecting apples while ensuring there's ample space to maneuver and avoid potential collisions.\n\n**Next Move:** UP"
