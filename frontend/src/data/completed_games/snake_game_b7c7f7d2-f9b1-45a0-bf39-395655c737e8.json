The closest apple is at (4, 0), which is directly down from my current position.\n2. There are no enemy snakes immediately threatening me.\n3. The board allows me to move towards this apple without risk.\n\nStrategy considerations:\n- I want to collect the closest apple to grow my snake\n- I want to avoid getting trapped or cornered\n- I want to move towards apples efficiently\n\nThinking through the move:\nThe apple at (4, 0) is the most strategic target. I can reach it by moving DOWN.\n\nPotential next turn strategy: After collecting this apple, I'll look to navigate towards other nearby apples while avoiding potential enemy snake movements.\n\nMy decided next move: DOWN"
