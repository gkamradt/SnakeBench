This move potentially opens up movement towards the center of the board, giving more options in future turns for apple acquisition.\n\n2. **Option to move LEFT** (to 0, 7):\n   - This move is less favorable as it places the snake closer to the left edge of the board, potentially limiting movement in later turns.\n\n3. **Option to move UP** (to 1, 8):\n   - Moves the snake closer to the upper edge without immediate benefit.\n\n4. **Option to move DOWN** (to 1, 6):\n   - Continues the movement towards the closest apple at (1, 3).

It allows the snake to potentially head down from a more central position later, either to target the apple at (1, 3) or to shift towards the center apples like (4,1) if required.\n\n---Decided next move: RIGHT."
