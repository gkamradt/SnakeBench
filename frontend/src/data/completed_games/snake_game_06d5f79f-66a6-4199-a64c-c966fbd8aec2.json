Being at (6, 8) opens options for future moves.\n2. **DOWN (6, 6)**: This position is also empty, but staying low does not help approach apples.\n3. **LEFT (5, 7)**: This position is where I came from (6, 7). Moving back doesn't bring any advancement.\n4. **RIGHT (7, 7)**: Another empty space, still in the same row. However, it does not lead directly to an apple in this turn.\n\n### Future Potential:\n- **Apples I Can Target**:\n  - The apple at (8, 5) will require several moves to actually reach.\n  - The apple at (7, 5) is a more immediate target, but moving from (6, 7) to (7, 5) will require moving first to (7, 7) so that could require an additional move.\n\n### Strategic Consideration:\n- Moving **UP (6, 8)** gives me a better perspective from the top, ensuring I'm safe from the enemy below. However, it does not directly head towards apples on the next turn.\n  \n- Moving **RIGHT (7, 7)** places me close to (7, 5) for easier access in my following moves without risking being trapped or cornered if enemy movements change. \n\nGiven I want to focus on positioning myself for future apple capture, I will choose to move **RIGHT (7, 7)**. \n\n### Decided Next Move: RIGHT"
