Getting an apple immediately is very beneficial, and there are no obstacles in that direction. \n\n\u2022 Additionally, enemy snake #2 is far away at (9,4) with its body at (9,5), so there\u2019s no immediate risk from them.\n\nGiven these observations, the best strategy now is to move RIGHT to grab the apple at (3,5), which will yield an immediate point boost and growth.\n\nMy decided next move: RIGHT"

The apple at (8, 2) is the closest and most accessible target\n2. Moving RIGHT will capture this apple\n3. No immediate collision risks\n4. Maintaining safe distance from enemy snake\n\nReasoning:\n- The RIGHT move allows apple collection\n- Coordinates remain within board limits\n- Provides a clear path for future moves\n- Positions me strategically for subsequent apple hunting\n\nSafety Check:\n- No risk of wall collision\n- No risk of snake collision\n- Move keeps options open for future turns\n\nNext Strategy Hint to Self:\n- After collecting (8, 2) apple, look towards (7, 7) or (5, 6)\n- Keep tracking enemy snake's movements\n- Maintain flexible positioning\n\nNext move: RIGHT"
