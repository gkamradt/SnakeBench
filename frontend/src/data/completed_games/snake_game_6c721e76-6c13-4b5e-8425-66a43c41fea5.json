I can loop around the top or bottom edge of the board to reach it.\n\nMy updated strategy is to avoid the enemy snake while steadily collecting apples. I'll go for farther apples and only approach ones near the enemy if I have a significant size advantage.\n\nFor this turn, I will go up again, heading towards (2, 5) and beyond to set myself up for reaching the apple at (9, 1).\n\nStrategy note for next turn: Continue moving up along the left side of the board.
