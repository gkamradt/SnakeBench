Growing the snake also creates a competitive advantage in the game.\n- After collecting the apples at (3, 7) and (3, 8), future moves can adapt based on the position and movement of enemy Snake #2 but with an initial tentative plan to then aim for the apple at (2, 6).\n\n**Future Strategy Reminder:**\n- Once the apples at (3, 7) and (3, 8) are secured, reevaluate the enemy's position and the remaining strategic positions of the apples to ensure that I do not corner myself or run into unintentional conflicts.\n- Be ready to alter the route either to the left or right, based on the safest and most resource-rich path.\n\n**Decided Next Move:**\nUP\n\nContinuing UP is strategically aligned with securing crucial resources while maintaining a safe and optimal positional trajectory on the board."

Additionally, moving vertically up allows the snake to potentially secure two apples back-to-back at (3, 8) and (3, 7).\n\n**Strategic Objective for Next Turn:**\n- After consuming the first apple at (3, 7), check the position of the enemy snake and assess whether it is feasible to secure the apple at (3, 8) or if a new direction should be considered to target other available apples while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\n### Decided Next Move:\nUP"

By focusing on vertical movement initially, the snake minimizes immediate turning and complications. Additionally, moving vertically up allows the snake to potentially secure two apples back-to-back at (3, 8) and (3, 7).\n\n**Strategic Objective for Next Turn:**\n- After consuming the first apple at (3, 7), check the position of the enemy snake and assess whether it is feasible to secure the apple at (3, 8) or if a new direction should be considered to target other available apples while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\n### Decided Next Move:\nUP"

Moving up will take advantage of the empty space along the y-axis from y=0 to y=7 without any immediate threats from other snakes, as Snake #2 is located on the far right at (9, 5).\n\nOther apples at (2, 6), (6, 6), and (7, 5) are spatially farther and require navigation through more coordinates, thereby potentially posing higher risk, especially considering the need to shift both x and y coordinates significantly. \n\n**Strategic Consideration for This Move:**\n- Focus should be on securing the closest and least risky apples, updating subsequent strategies based on the new position of the snake, the distribution of remaining apples, and the movement of the enemy snake. By focusing on vertical movement initially, the snake minimizes immediate turning and complications. Additionally, moving vertically up allows the snake to potentially secure two apples back-to-back at (3, 8) and (3, 7).\n\n**Strategic Objective for Next Turn:**\n- After consuming the first apple at (3, 7), check the position of the enemy snake and assess whether it is feasible to secure the apple at (3, 8) or if a new direction should be considered to target other available apples while avoiding the enemy snake.\n\n### Decided Next Move:\nUP"
